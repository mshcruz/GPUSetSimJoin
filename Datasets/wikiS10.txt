S182	2563352	Sweep or sweep oar rowing is a type of rowing when a rower has one oar usually held with both hands As each rower has only one oar the rowers have to be paired so that there is an oar on each side of the boat This is in contrast to sculling when a rower has two oars one in each hand In the UK the term is less used as the term rowing generally refers to sweep oar The term pulling was also used historically Sweep or single oar rowing has a long history and was the means of propulsion for Greek triremes and Viking longboats These boats were wide enough for the pairs of rowers to sit alongside each other Boats can go faster the narrower they are because a smaller cross sectional area reduces drag and wave drag and gives a sharper angle to the bow The hulls can be kept narrower by attaching riggers to the gunwales so that the oarlocks can be placed farther out to carry longer oars A narrower hull means the rowers can not sit side by side and so they sit one behind another The riggers are staggered alternately along the boat so that the forces apply asymmetrically to each side of the boat This means a sweep oared racing shell has to be stiffer in order to handle the unmatched forces and so requires more bracing which means it has to be heavier and slower than an equivalent sculling boat Sweep rowing has to be done with crews in multiples of two i e pairs fours and eights sixes and boats longer than eight are not used in competitive racing today Each rower in a sweep boat is referred to as being on stroke side port or bow side starboard depending on which side of the boat the rower s oar extends In a sculling boat the riggers apply forces symmetrically While sculling boats are also in multiples of two it is possible to have a single scull or triple scull The primary sweep oar racing boats are as follows Eight 8 A shell with 8 rowers Always with coxswain because of the size weight and speed of the boat bow loader eights exist but are banned from most competitions for safety reasons Four 4 or 4 A shell with 4 rowers Coxless fours 4 are often referred to as straight fours and are commonly used by lightweight and elite crews and are raced at the Olympics In club and school rowing one more frequently sees a coxed four 4 which is easier to row and has a coxswain to steer Pair 2 or 2 A shell with 2 rowers The coxless pair 2 often called a straight pair is a demanding but satisfying boat to master Coxed pairs 2 are rarely rowed by most club and school programs It is no longer an Olympic class event but it continues to be rowed at the World Rowing Championships u2191 u2191

S809	280672	The Synod of Beth Lapat was a council of the Church of the East held in 484 under the leadership of Catholicos Bar Sauma It can be regarded as the birth of the Persian Church which eventually seceded from the rest of the Church of the East in 604 rejecting reforms introduced by Babai the Great The most significant result of the synod was the church s official adoption of the doctrine of Nestorianism Other decisions made at the council included a disavowal of clerical celibacy This disavowal became the distinguishing feature of Monasticism in the Persian Church distinguishing it from the rest of the Church of the East The adoption of Nestorius teaching who had been condemned at the First Council of Ephesus in 431 effectively separated the Church of the East from the Byzantine church The decisions were clearly aimed at pleasing the Zoroastrian Persian kings who were at constant war with the now Christian Byzantine Empire the previous pro Byzantine Catholicos Babowai had been executed and the Persians had given protection to Nestorian refugees since 462 Zoroastrians viewed family life sacred and abhorred the monastic movement of the Christians For these reasons critics came to refer to the Nestorians who had disavowed clerical celibacy as the Persian Church The decision did not improve the Persian state policy against the church Some members of the church left and joined the Miaphysite Churches

S824	23748	Underwater archaeology is archaeology practiced underwater As with all other branches of archaeology it evolved from its roots in pre history and in the classical era to include sites from the historical and industrial eras Its acceptance has been a relatively late development due to the difficulties of accessing and working underwater sites and because the application of archaeology to underwater sites initially emerged from the skills and tools developed by shipwreck salvagers As a result underwater archaeology initially struggled to establish itself as bona fide archaeological research The situation changed when universities began teaching the subject and when a theoretical and practical base for the sub discipline was firmly established Underwater Archaeology now has a number of branches including after it became broadly accepted in the late 1980s maritime archaeology the scientifically based study of past human life behaviours and cultures and their activities in on around and lately under the sea estuaries and rivers This is most often effected using the physical remains found in around or under salt or fresh water or buried beneath water logged sediment In recent years the study of submerged WWII sites and of submerged aircraft in the form of underwater aviation archaeology have also emerged as bona fide activity Though often mistaken as such underwater archaeology is not restricted to the study of shipwrecks Changes in sea level because of local seismic events such as the earthquakes that devastated Port Royal and Alexandria or more widespread climatic or changes on a continental scale mean that some sites of human occupation that were once on dry land are now submerged At the end of the last ice age the North Sea was a great plain and anthropological material as well as the remains of animals such as mammoths are sometimes recovered by trawlers Also because human societies have always made use of water sometimes the remains of structures that these societies built underwater still exist such as the foundations of crannogs bridges and harbours when traces on dry land have been lost As a result underwater archaeological sites can include a vast range including submerged indigenous sites and places where people once lived or visited that have been subsequently covered by water due to rising sea levels wells cenotes wrecks shipwrecks aircraft the remains of structures created in water such as crannogs bridges or harbours other port related structures refuse or debris sites where people disposed of their waste garbage and other items such as ships aircraft munitions and machinery by dumping into the water Underwater archaeology is often complementary to archaeological research on terrestrial sites because often the two are linked by many and various elements including geographic social political economic and other considerations As a result a study of an archaeological landscape can involve a multidisciplinary approach requiring the inclusion of many specialists from a variety of disciplines including prehistory historical archaeology maritime archaeology anthropology There are many examples One is the wreck of the VOC ship Zuytdorp lost in 1711 on the coast of Western Australia and where there remains considerable speculation that some of the crew survived and after establishing themselves on shore intermixed with Indigenous tribes from the area The archaeological signature at this site also now extends into the interaction between indigenous people and the European pastoralists who entered the area in the mid 19th century
