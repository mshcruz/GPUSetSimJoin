S0	We report here that the neuropeptide cerebellin a known marker of cerebellar Purkinje cells has only one substantial extracerebellar location the dorsal cochlear nucleus DCoN By reversephase highperformance liquid chromatography and radioimmunoassay cerebellum and DCoN in rat were found to contain similar concentrations of this hexadecapeptide Immunocytochemistry with our rabbit antiserum C1 raised against synthetic cerebellin revealed that cerebellinlike immunoreactivity in the cerebellum is localized exclusively to Purkinje cells while in the DCoN it is found primarily in cartwheel cells and in the basal dendrites of pyramidal neurons Some displaced Purkinje cells were also stained Although cerebellum and DCoN receive their inputs from different brain regions their organizations show several similarities with many neuronal cell types present in one having their presumed homologue in the other Cerebellin is present in Purkinje and cartwheel cells throughout the cerebellum and the DCoN without site predilection This should be viewed together with recent data indicating that these two classes of neurons share a similar fate in several murine mutations nervous lurcher Purkinje cell degeneration and staggerer This situation leads us to conclude that cerebellin represents a marker for a small number of spatially related neuronal cell classes and that it may play a role in an as yet unknown aspect of a circuit function worthy of further exploration
S1	We retrospectively reviewed the roentgenographic and pathologic staging of 64 patients with renal cell carcinoma to assess the role of the various staging modalities ie angiography venacavography bone scanning ultrasound computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging Specific attention was directed at detecting vena cava thrombus and metastatic bone disease factors with a significant impact on the therapeutic approach The findings support the role of CT as the principle tool for overall staging and the observation that venacavography is not indicated if CT has excluded caval thrombus Similarly routine bone scans are not warranted in the absence of an elevated alkaline phosphatase level or bone pain The key to the more efficient utilization of imaging resources is understanding the capabilities of the technology available
S2	We examined 1 the effect of Lcarnitine supplementation on free fatty acid FFA utilization during exercise and 2 exerciseinduced alterations in plasma levels and skeletal muscle exchange of carnitine Seven moderately trained human male subjects serving as their own controls participated in two bicycle exercise sessions 120 min 50 of VO2max The second exercise was preceded by 5 days of oral carnitine supplementation CS 5 g daily Despite a doubling of plasma carnitine levels with CS there were no effects on exerciseinduced changes in arterial levels and turnover of FFA the relation between leg FFA inflow and FFA uptake or the leg exchange of other substrates Heart rate during exercise after CS decreased 78 but O2 uptake was unchanged Exercise before CS induced a fall from 334  16 to 308  10 SE mumoll in free plasma carnitine despite a release 25  09 mumolmin from the leg Simultaneously acylated plasma carnitine rose from 50  10 to 142  14 mumoll with no evidence of leg release Consequently total plasma carnitine increased We concluded that in healthy subjects CS does not influence muscle substrate utilization either at rest or during prolonged exercise and that free carnitine released from muscle during exercise is presumably acylated in the liver and released to plasma
S3	To probe for free radical intermediates in the model methylmalonate to succinate rearrangements promoted by vitamin B12s a model series with a pentenyl side chain radical trap has been devised The control free radical generated by trinbutyltin hydride treatment of bromomethylpentenylmalonate thioester undergoes rapid cyclization to the sixmembered ring and as anticipated no succinate rearrangement product is detected By contrast when the bromide is treated with vitamin B12s little cyclized product is observed the major product is the pentenyl succinate This result demonstrates that the latter rearrangement does not follow a free radical pathway
S4	We have developed a transient gene expression assay system in the aquatic monocot Lemna gibba in which DNA was introduced into intact tissue by particle bombardment Constructs based on the Lemna rbcS gene SSU5B which is positively regulated by phytochrome in vivo also showed phytochrome regulation in the transient assay system Reporter gene expression increased 12fold over dark levels in response to a single treatment with red light This increase was not observed if farred light was immediately followed by the red light A 5 deletion analysis of the promoter defined a region from position 205 to position 83 relative to the start of transcription as necessary to observe the phytochrome response This region contains the binding site for the lightinduced binding activity LRF1 found in Lemna nuclear extracts Upstream of position 205 we found evidence for the presence of at least two upstream activating sequences and a silencer
S5	The transcription of heat shock genes in response to physiological stress requires activation of heat shock transcription factor HSF Although the transcriptional response is most commonly induced by temperature elevation the biochemical events involved in HSF activation in vivo can also be triggered at normal physiological temperatures by chemicals that inhibit metabolic processes We have used a HeLa cellfree system in which HSF DNAbinding is activated by conditions that affect protein conformation including increasing concentrations of hydrogen ions urea or nonionic detergents Treatment with calcium ions also results in a concentration and timedependent activation of HSF in vitro Pretreatment with each of these biochemical conditions reduces the temperature dependence for HSF activation in vitro These results suggest that HSF is activated either directly by undergoing a conformational change or indirectly through interactions with unfolded proteins
S6	This study was undertaken to examine the antinociceptive roles of different subtypes of opiate receptors and their interactions at the level of the spinal cord We recorded extracellularly the activity of the single wide dynamic range neurons evoked by noxious radiant heat 51 degrees C in decerebrate spinally transected cats The separate intrathecal administration of DAGO selective muagonist n  28 morphine less selective muagonist n  22 DPDPE selective deltaagonist n  25 and DADL less selective deltaagonist n  17 produced statistically significant suppression of noxiously evoked activity in a time and dosedependent manner In addition intravenously administered naloxone nonselective opiate antagonist reversed the suppressive effects of all opiates studied Intravenously administered ICI 174864 selective deltaantagonist reversed the effects of DPDPE These results based on relative selectivity for opiate receptors indicate that both mu and deltaopiate receptors can modulate the input of nociceptive information in the spinal dorsal horn To study interactions between mu and deltareceptors at the level of the spinal cord a combination of the above agonists was injected intrathecallynamely an ineffective or slightly effective dose of DAGO 1 or 15 micrograms respectively that was combined with an ineffective dose of DPDPE 30 micrograms The intrathecal combination of DAGO and DPDPE produced significant synergistic suppressive effects of noxiously evoked activity These findings again based on relative selectivity suggest that drug combinations that include both selective mu and deltaagonists may be a useful method of lowering the total amount of any one drug thus decreasing the likelihood of side effects while at the same time producing significant analgesiaABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S7	The importance of interaction of exhaled air with the airway surface was evaluated by comparing the effects of different breathing maneuvers and inhaled air temperature on the relationship between breath alcohol concentration BRAC and blood alcohol concentration BAC Breath alcohol was measured with an infrared absorption unit Blood and simulator liquid alcohol concentrations were measured by gas chromatography Breath samples were measured after both low and high exhaled volumes and after rebreathing Breathing maneuvers were performed after either hyperventilation breathhold or normal breathing Inspired air temperature was varied between 0 degree C and 40 degrees C The rebreathing method for sampling alveolar alcohol samples was evaluated with a new isothermal rebreather that was designed to provide a substantial amount of heat to the rebreathed air in order to heat the airway surfaces Using a single breath test the indicated BAC values vary from 14 above the actual BAC to as low as 55 below the actual BAC Hyperventilation caused a significant decrease in BRAC and breathhold caused a significant increase in BRAC When isothermal rebreathing is applied to such tests the breath test results were always within  10 of the true BAC even with an altered breathing pattern Isothermal rebreathing provided an accurate sample of alveolar air that was not affected by altered breathing pattern or air temperature
S8	In an open study continuous oral therapy with cyclooxygenase inhibitors ibuprofen or indomethacin reduced the incidence and frequency of recurrent eruptions in nine of 16 patients with herpes simplex virus infection Retrospective analysis of seven cases indicated that natural killer cell enhancement assays might allow us to predict the clinical outcome of such treatment
S9	Of 6148 original cohort and offspring subjects of the Framingham Heart Study who underwent routine evaluation a healthy group of 347 men aged 42  12 years and 517 women aged 43  12 years was identified to develop echocardiographic criteria for left ventricular LV hypertrophy Healthy subjects were defined as normotensive receiving no cardiac or antihypertensive medications nonobese and free of cardiopulmonary disease Echocardiographic criteria in accordance with the American Society of Echocardiography convention for LV hypertrophy based on mean plus 2 standard deviations for LV mass LV mass corrected for body surface area and LV mass corrected for height in this healthy sample are respectively 294 g 150 gm2 and 163 gm in men and 198 g 120 gm2 and 121 gm in women Criteria based on LV massheight result in higher prevalence rates of LV hypertrophy than LV massbody surface area while still correcting for body size The prevalence of LV hypertrophy in the entire study population using LV massheight criteria is 16 in men and 19 in women Until outcome guided criteria for LV hypertrophy are developed application of sexspecific criteria based on a healthy population distribution of LV mass offer the best approach to echocardiographic diagnosis of LV hypertrophy
S10	Schneiderian inverted papillomas may be troublesome lesions for clinicians with propensity for recurrences Dysplasia is not uncommonly seen and some of these lesions do progress to develop squamous carcinoma The authors hybridized in situ seven inverted papillomas with RNA probes to human papillomavirus HPV 6 11 16 and 18 Four of these contained dysplasia two were without dysplasia and one contained invasive squamous cell carcinoma Five inverted papillomas showed evidence of HPV infection based on hybridization One with mild to moderate and one with severe dysplasia and one without dysplasia hybridized with mixed probe HPV 611 One with mild dysplasia and one associated with invasive squamous cell carcinoma hybridized with mixed probe HPV 1618 One inverted papilloma without dysplasia and one with severe dysplasia did not definitively hybridize with either mixed probe These findings raise interesting questions as to role of HPV 611 and 1618 in the development of inverted papillomas and probably on the progression to and carcinoma
S11	The serum antibody response to Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide or its protein conjugate vaccine PRP and PRPD respectively was studied in 28 children initially immunized at the age of 24 mo with either vaccine and in 10 children immunized for the third time with PRPD at the age of 18 mo The methods used were isotyperesolving enzyme immunoassay Farrtype radioimmunoassay and the in vitro bactericidal activity BCA test Immunization with PRP evoked a higher proportion of IgA antibodies than did either the first or third dose of PRPD whereas the latter vaccine evoked a somewhat higher IgG response but the differences were not statistically significant In all groups the IgG antibody responses were predominantly IgG1 with the mean proportions being 822 842 and 659 in the PRP firstdose PRPD and thirddose PRPD groups respectively Postimmunization antibodies were functionally active in the BCA test
S12	An asymptomatic population of 37000 people in the Nottingham area were offered faecal occult blood tests in a screening study for colorectal cancer Seventeen thousand nine hundred and thirty people completed the tests and 481 individuals with positive tests underwent full investigation of the colon Eight people with previously undiagnosed inflammatory bowel disease were identified In five cases there was total ulcerative colitis in one a proctitis and in two Crohns disease Two further patients with ulcerative colitis were identified they had been lost to follow up for 25 and 45 years respectively The combined prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease was 56105 and it is likely that current studies of the epidemiology of these conditions may underestimate the true prevalence by between 27 and 38
S13	The incidence of perinatal chemical use is undoubtedly much higher than the rate of use detected at any single point during pregnancy As the prevalence is likely to be 10 or greater in any community obstetricians need to employ measures to detect chemical use similar to measures taken to detect birth defects gestational diabetes syphilis gonorrhea and preeclampsia The use of screening protocols must be accompanied by an awareness of the need for intervention and treatment resources Identification of perinatal chemical use should be for purposes of medical and social intervention not criminal prosecution Obstetric management should focus on the prevention of preterm delivery and intrauterine growth retardation It should be recognized that pregnancy provides a unique opportunity for the encouragement of positive health behaviors Programs that include such components may be able to achieve more lasting effects
S14	Chloroaluminum sulfonated phthalocyanine CASPc a novel photosensitizing dye was evaluated for treatment of experimental intraocular melanoma in 33 rabbit eyes An argon ion pumped dye laser operating at an emission of 675 nm was used in a nonthermal mode to irradiate iris tumors in rabbits 24 hours after they received in intravenous dye injection 23 eyes The effects of laser irradiation alone and dye alone were examined in ten control eyes A threshold tumoricidal dose was established for photodynamic therapy with CASPc and laser irradiation Vascular occlusion was produced in a wellcircumscribed area corresponding to the boundaries of laser irradiation after CASPc injection Tumors successfully treated with CASPc and laser irradiation were arrested in growth and exhibited no viable tumor cells on histologic examination Control tumors continued rapid growth unaffected by dye or laser Our data indicate that CASPc demonstrates a strong photosensitizing effect on both tumor and normal tissue These results suggest that CASPc is a potential photosensitizing compound that may be useful in the treatment of choroidal melanoma
S15	PURPOSE There is increasing evidence of a central role for the calcium ion in blood pressure regulation By studying blood pressure control in disorders of calcium homeostasis a better understanding of the role of the calcium ion and certain calcitrophic hormones in modulating arterial pressure in humans may be gained Our goal was to examine levels of blood pressure in a group of patients with either type Ia or type Ib pseudohypoparathyroidism PsHP a disorder characterized by target organ resistance to parathyroid hormone PATIENTS AND METHODS Fortysix patients with type I PsHP were recruited for the study 28 with type Ia and 18 with type Ib Blood pressure was measured and the degree of obesity was assessed in all patients Detailed measurements of hormones involved in blood pressure regulation were made in nine hypertensive patients with PsHP RESULTS Elevated arterial pressure was present in 18 of the 46 patients with PsHP which comprised 53 percent 18 of 34 of the adult subjects Prevalence of hypertension was similar in PsHP type Ia nine of 21 and type Ib nine of 13 p not significant and was not related to coexisting hypothyroidism or degree of hypocalcemia However hypertension in PsHP was strongly linked to severe obesity Mean body weights of normotensive and hypertensive patients with PsHP were 64  28 SEM kg 125  6 percent ideal body weight and 96  47 kg 172  10 percent ideal body weight respectively Compared with obese hypertensive nonPsHP persons hypertensive subjects with PsHP had reduced basal and posturestimulated renin activity basal 168  036 n  9 versus 397  061 ngmlhour n  9 p less than 005 upright posture 211  042 versus 713 ngmlhour p less than 005 and lower basal and posturestimulated plasma norepinephrine levels basal 236  52 versus 426  37 pgml p less than 005 upright posture 424  62 versus 707  64 pgml p less than 005 CONCLUSION Our data suggest that hypertension is common in PsHP types Ia and Ib This newly identified form of endocrine hypertension is strongly linked to excessive body weight but is associated with alterations in the reninaldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems that are distinct from those encountered in obesityrelated hypertension in the general population The pathophysiologic basis for hypertension in these two distinctly different forms of PsHP remains to be determined
S16	The literature describing the fall in PaO2 during dialysis is intensively and critically reviewed This phenomenon is related to both the type of membrane used cellulosic v noncellulosic membrane and to the composition of the dialysate acetate v bicarbonate It appears that a ventilationperfusion mismatch due to pulmonary leukostasis can in part explain hypoxemia in patients dialyzed with cellulosic membranes This phenomenon is especially apparent in patients with preexisting pulmonary abnormalities However hypoventilation remains the major cause of hypoxemia This hypoventilation is mainly due to CO2 consumption during acetate metabolism acetate dialysis or alkalinization of the blood bicarbonate dialysis The metabolic consequences of acetate metabolism and of bicarbonate and CO2 losses through the dialyzer are critically analyzed The cause for the increment in oxygen consumption during acetate dialysis is examined Finally the respective role of these combined factors are described and used to explain the changes in VCO2 VO2 respiratory quotient RQ and PaO2 reported in the literature during dialysis against acetate andor bicarbonate
S17	Advances in molecular biology research continue to have a major impact on clinical medicine These advances have provided a means to produce proteins previously available in limited supply and allow for the production of novel proteins that are improved agonists or else antagonists with greater specificity for therapeutic targets Newer drug delivery systems should facilitate delivery of these proteins By combining the capabilities to produce drug targets in acceptable quantities with improved methods for determining the threedimensional structures of these targets novel organic therapeutic molecules that act on these targets will be designed Gene transfer therapy using genes that express important proteins or that encode antisense RNAs that inhibit the translation of specific mRNAs will soon become a reality The use of RFLPs and PCR methodologies promises increased means to diagnose specific genetic diseases and infections Most importantly molecular biology is helping to understand the mechanisms of disease such that novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches can be described These advances are providing an understanding of the mechanisms involved in cancers of the thyroid gland They have already led to an enhanced understanding of 1 the growth factors that control proliferation of the thyroid gland 2 the potential steps in thyroid nodule and neoplasia development 3 particular mutations that may occur as thyroid cancers develop 4 oncogenes that are expressed in thyroid cancers and 5 the genetic defects that are responsible for thyroid gland malignancies in the multiple endocrine neoplasia MEN syndromes With the latter the RFLP technology has already provided an enhanced means to diagnose the disorder With further progress enhanced means for diagnosis and treatment should emerge Molecular biology techniques are contributing to an increased understanding of the mechanisms of development of autoimmune thyroid disease as with Graves disease and Hashimotos thyroiditis The potential role of infections histocompatibility antigens thyroid gland and extraglandular antigens immune modulators subpopulations of Tcells such as suppressor and helper cells other cells involved in immune responses and a combination of influences of several different functions on the thyroid gland are being defined This knowledge should soon suggest improved means for diagnosis and treatment Understanding of the function of the thyroid hormone receptors should have clinical importance This knowledge suggests a means to develop thyroid hormone antagonists that may be used to more rapidly ameliorate the effects of hyperthyroidism and could be useful in nonthyroidal disorders such as cardiac arrhythmiasABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS
S18	Sinusoidal harmonic acceleration has become a common method used in diagnostic vestibular testing When properly used it can produce normal and abnormal patterns that can be interpreted in the context of the nature of the stimulus and the physiologic processes that describe the responses to it Thus the aim of this review is to present specific information regarding the sinusoidal harmonic acceleration stimulus and vestibular physiology in a way that will hopefully aid in test interpretation
S19	While studies have evaluated the accuracy of adult patients and health personnel in reading various glucose oxidase impregnated strips to estimate blood glucose there are no studies exclusively evaluating the accuracy of children with diabetes reading their own strips as compared to a staff member and meter to meter variability in reading these strips We evaluated the accuracy of reading chemstrip bG by children at a summer camp The childrens visual readings of their own strips were compared to the visual reading of a single staff member A total of 356 Chemstrip bGs were visually read by diabetic children and a single trained staff member at a summer camp for diabetics The strips were then analyzed by two AccuChek bG meters Intermachine variability was found to be negligible over the entire bG range For the purposes of this study we define accurate visual readings as those within  15 percent of the meter reading of a given strip At low bG values 4079 mgdl accuracy by children and staff is low with underestimating occurring in 39 percent of staff readings and 57 percent of childrens readings At intermediate bG values 120239 mgdl readings are more accurate especially when read by the staff with misreadings occurring in only 1619 percent of the strips At high bG values 240399 mgdl accuracy by children is decreased with underestimation 500 percent more often than staff We conclude that children are less accurate at reading Chemstrip bG than a trained staff member 51 versus 33 misreading especially at the upper and lower ranges of bG values when visual readings are least accurate and the need for therapeutic intervention is the greatest
S20	A proteintyrosinephosphatase PTPase 1B proteintyrosinephosphate phosphohydrolase EC 31348 specific for phosphotyrosyl residues was microinjected into Xenopus oocytes This resulted in a 3 to 5fold increase in PTPase activity over endogenous levels The PTPase blocked the insulinstimulated phosphorylation of tyrosyl residues on endogenous proteins including a protein having a molecular mass in the same range as the beta subunit of the insulin or insulinlike growth factor I receptor PTPase 1B also blocked the activation of an S6 peptide kinaseie an enzyme recognizing a peptide having the sequence RRLSSLRA found in a segment of ribosomal protein S6 and known to be activated early in response to insulin On the other hand the insulin stimulation of an S6 kinase detected by using 40S ribosomes as substrate was unaffected even though PTPase 1B partially prevented the phosphorylation of ribosomal protein S6 in vivo Mono Q chromatography of insulintreated oocyte extracts revealed two main peaks of S6 kinase activity Fractions from the first peak displayed S6 peptide kinase activity that was essentially abolished in profiles from PTPase 1Binjected oocytes Material from the second peak which was best revealed by using 40S ribosomes as substrate and had comparatively little S6 peptide kinase activity was minimally affected by PTPase 1B These observations suggest that at least two distinct S6 kinases are involved in ribosomal protein S6 phosphorylation in vivo and that the activation pathways for these enzymes differ in their sensitivity to PTPase 1B
S21	Two electrophoretically homogeneous immunoglobulins were detected in the serum of a patient with multiple myeloma The heavy chains were of different classes gamma 1 and gamma 2 The light chains of both were kappa but had different electrophoretic mobilities on polyacrylamide gels Amino acid sequence analysis carbohydrate determinations and biosynthetic experiments indicated that the difference seen in their electrophoretic mobility was due to the glycosylation of one but not the other kappachain The primary structure of both chains demonstrated that they both used a V kappa 1 and a J kappa 2 gene segment and the same C kappa allele Km12 and that both contained the same junctional three amino acid deletion However they varied by 19 amino acids in the first 94 amino terminal residues encoded for by the V kappa gene with some of the substitutions requiring two base changes in the appropriate codons Moreover the malignant clones producing the two proteins differed in their responses to chemotherapy These data indicate that although the two clones producing the serum proteins were different at the time of study they may have arisen from the same precursor clone
S22	BACKGROUND Nitroglycerin and other clinically relevant organic nitrate derivatives have been shown to inhibit platelet aggregation in vitro This antithrombotic effect of nitrates is potentiated by reduced thiol To determine the potential relevance of this mechanism of action in vivo we examined the effect of intravenous nitroglycerin infusion on periodic platelet thrombus formation in a canine model of coronary artery stenosis METHODS AND RESULTS We used a canine model of coronary artery stenosis associated with cyclic reductions in coronary blood flow that have been shown to depend on periodic platelet thrombus formation We quantified the frequency of cycles per 40minute observation period and monitored the effect of a continuous infusion of intravenous nitroglycerin on the cycle frequency The administration of 1015 microgramskgmin nitroglycerin reduced cyclic platelet thrombus formation significantly and did so without a significant change in coronary artery blood flow Pretreatment with the reduced thiol Nacetylcysteine 100 mgkg during 30 minutes led to inhibition of cyclic platelet thrombus formation by intravenous nitroglycerin at doses that alone had no such effect 5 microgramskgmin CONCLUSION These data suggest that one mechanism by which intravenous nitroglycerin improves ischemia in acute coronary artery disease syndromes may be by inhibition of platelet thrombus formation and may highlight the potential importance of reduced thiol in this mechanism
S23	Various concentrations of NiCl2 in a hydrogel were evaluated as a possible alternative to the standard patch test material of 5 NiSO4 pet Patch test responses were recorded on a total of 430 patients with known or suspected contact allergy A NiCl2 concentration of 1 or less in the hydrogel failed to elicit a response in some patients who reacted to 5 NiSO4 pet The 2 NiCl2 hydrogel produced a small increase in response frequency and may reduce falsenegative reactions Along with the ability of the material to improve the topical bioavailability of nickel ions more irritant reactions were observed However in cases with a positive history and a negative patch test with petrolatum the hydrogel prepared from MethocelE4M seems to be a useful alternative vehicle for watersoluble allergens
S24	To investigate the physiological relationship between serum GHbinding proteins and 24h GH release we compared the 24h GH pulse attributes in serum samples obtained at 20min intervals to the serum GHbinding protein activity GHBP from 38 normal boys between 7 512 and 18 412 yr of age GHBP was determined in a serum sample from each study containing less than 10 microgramsL GH using a standardized GHBP assay GHBP results are expressed as the percentage of 125Ihuman GH bound to the high affinity GHBP complex peak II per 160 microL serum There were significant inverse relationships between the high affinity receptorrelated GHBP and several characteristics of 24h GH release Specifically GHBP was significantly P less than 0005 for all but negatively correlated with mean 24h GH concentration r  062 sum of the GH pulse amplitudes r  057 sum of the GH pulse areas r  055 interpulse mean GH concentration r  053 and number of GH pulses per 24 h r  053 In addition GHBP correlated positively with the mean time interval between pulses r  059 There was also a significant positive correlation r  075 P less than 0001 between GHBP and the subjects ageadjusted body mass index SD score BMISDS Each characteristic of 24h GH release correlating inversely with GHBP also correlated inversely with BMISDS P less than 001 for all comparisons GHBP did not however correlate with plasma insulinlike growth factorI levels serum testosterone concentrations or height SDS Binding to the low affinity GHBP peak I did not correlate significantly with any of the examined GH pulse attributes BMISDS or the degree of binding to the high affinity GHBP peak II We conclude that an inverse relationship exists between the high affinity serum GHBP and 24h GH release in boys under normal physiological conditions We speculate that abnormalities in this relationship probably also exist and may underlie some disorders of growth
S25	The reversed whole stomach was used in 29 patients to bypass nonresectable carcinoma of the esophagus The mobilized distal stomach after duodenal transection immediately beyond the pylorus was placed in a substernal and anterior mediastinal tunnel and the prepyloric area was anastomosed to the cervical esophagus Lengthening of the stomach was obtained by division of the lesser curve In this series the operative mortality rate was 4 per cent morbidity was minimal and the whole procedure proved relatively easier to perform than the conventional isoperistaltic gastric esophagoplasty There is no expected improvement in life expectancy but morbidity decreased because of preservation of the esophagogastric drainage thus avoiding a mucocele of the excluded esophagus and preservation of the vagus nerves
S26	Fifty to ninety percent of pediatric AIDS cases are complicated by neurologic dysfunction We present a case of a 5yearold black female with AIDS encephalopathy and Mycobacterium avium intracellulare Her initial presentation was that of neuroencephalopathy with loss of developmental milestones pyramidal tract signs and subsequent evidence of cortical atrophy Her initial CT scan at the time of frank encephalopathy was normal whereas 18 months into the clinical course of her encephalopathy her CT scan of the head demonstrated typical ventricular dilatation and severe cortical atrophy consonant with her clinical picture She subsequently developed Mycobacterium avium intracellulare documented by gastric aspirate culture and other opportunistic infections including Candida esophagitis Her neuroencephalopathy plateaued with continued evidence of immune dysfunction and mycobacterium by gastric aspirate despite triple antibiotic therapy with INH streptomycin Pyrazinamide with later addition of Rifampin and final substitution of the investigational congener Rifabutin AIDS encephalopathy and Mycobacterium intracellulare are discussed in terms of their prognosis and therapy particularly in view of new reports of the application of AZT and immunoglobulin therapy
S27	An 80yearold white male was treated with a right total knee arthroplasty after three years of incapacitating knee pain that did not respond to conservative therapy A pneumatic tourniquet was placed around the right proximal thigh prior to surgery Before applying the dressing assessment of the right foot revealed an adequate vascular status On the first postoperative morning the popliteal and pedal pulses were absent An arteriogram identified complete occlusion of the distal superficial femoral artery and popliteal artery down to and including the trifurcation After a right femoral artery embolectomy the pulses returned and the patient suffered no residual deficit from the arterial occlusion The patient had a prior history of prostatic carcinoma and was taking diethylstilbestrol these factors along with ageassociated atherosclerotic disease and the tourniquet application created a favorable environment for such a rare complication Factors that may compromise vascularity when using the pneumatic tourniquet must be given due consideration
S28	A human peripheral Tcell cDNA library was screened with two labeled synthetic oligonucleotides encoding regions of a human placenta proteintyrosinephosphatase proteintyrosinephosphate phosphohydrolase EC 31348 One positive clone was isolated and the nucleotide sequence was determined It contained 1305 base pairs of open reading frame followed by a TAA stop codon and 978 base pairs of 3 untranslated end although a polyA tail was not found An initiator methionine residue was predicted at position 61 which would result in a protein of 415 amino acid residues Mr 48400 This was supported by the synthesis of a Mr 48000 protein in an in vitro reticulocyte lysate translation system using RNA transcribed from the cloned cDNA and T7 RNA polymerase The deduced amino acid sequence was compared to other known proteins revealing 65 identity to the low Mr PTPase 1B isolated from placenta In view of the high degree of similarity the Tcell cDNA likely encodes a newly discovered proteintyrosinephosphatase thus expanding this family of genes
S29	Endogenous overnight 22000800 hours creatinine clearance and serum concentrations of beta 2microglobulin and water were measured three times a week during 11 ovulatory menstrual cycles In some of the women creatinine clearance changed more than 100 within a week from values below reference range to high normal levels In all the women the creatinine clearance was higher during the luteal than during the follicular phase and correlated with the production of ovarian hormones The urinary excretion rate of creatinine was highest during the luteal phase Urinary volume serum creatinine and serum water were not significantly influenced by the menstrual phases An unexplained finding was a parallel change in the individual creatinine clearance and serum beta 2microglobulin during the luteal but not during the follicular phase Our results suggest that ovarian hormones influence creatinine clearance during the menstrual cycle One must therefore accept even considerable shorttime variations in creatinine clearance in fertile women It remains to be settled if these changes reflect true alterations in glomerular filtration rate or mainly changes in the urinary tubular excretion rate of creatinine
S30	Abortion hysterectomy has been discredited as the method of performing simultaneous pregnancy termination and elective sterilization for women with undesired pregnancies who simultaneously wish to end their childbearing potential The procedure continues to be advocated however for cases in which there is an underlying gynecologic pathologic condition The morbidity of this procedure has not been directly compared with that for indicated hysterectomy in nonpregnant women Between January 1976 and January 1987 50 patients underwent abortion hysterectomy at The University of Chicago The morbidity and mortality rates of these patients were compared with those of 50 premenopausal nonpregnant women undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for gynecologic pathologic status There was no statistically significant different between the groups in the duration of surgery estimated blood loss or infectious morbidity No operative site infections or other adverse sequelae were noted at the time of final postoperative examination These data support the relative safety of abdominal abortion hysterectomy for women with undesired pregnancy in whom hysterectomy is indicated for an underlying gynecologic pathologic condition
S31	Naproxen tolerability in elderly patients was assessed using data from 9 double blind clinical trials We analyzed the percentage of patients who a withdrew for complaints b reported complaints and c exhibited clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities Among 1178 patients with rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis 26 were 65 years old or older These elderly patients demonstrated no consistent decrease in tolerability or increase in toxicity of naproxen as compared with younger patients
S32	Anterior fontanelles from 19 fetuses over a range of gestational ages from 8 weeks to full term were obtained to study the anatomy and development in relation to the application of the principles of fontanometry The most important feature was the development of an elastic membrane by 23 weeks gestation a subcutaneous layer of fat had appeared by 28 weeks gestation
S33	To study the postnatal maturation of vagal control of airway muscle tone we determined the effects of vagotomy and supramaximal vagal stimulation on the resistance of the respiratory system in eight newborn and seven 6wkold piglets Because the lung periphery has distinctive responses to cholinergic agonists and a lower density of vagal fibers and cholinergic receptors than the central airways we partitioned the respiratory resistance of the piglets between central airways Rc and peripheral airways and lung tissue Rp with bronchial catheters inserted in a retrograde manner The piglets were anesthetized with alphachloralose and ventilated with positive airway pressure Vagotomy did not change Rc or Rp in either the newborn or the 6wkold piglets Vagal stimulation on the other hand increased both Rc median increase 53 in the newborn and 72 in the 6wkold piglets and Rp 54 and 42 respectively At all states of vagal tone Rp increased as the lungs were inflated suggesting a large contribution of tissue viscoelasticity to this resistance Our results demonstrate that vagal bronchomotor tone is absent during mechanical ventilation with positive pressure in the developing piglet However vagal innervation of both central airways and tissue contractile elements is functionally competent at the time of birth in this species
S34	We used magnetic resonance imaging to determine the volume of the mamillary bodies in 9 patients with chronic Wernickes encephalopathy 7 patients with presumed Alzheimers disease and 37 control patients The mean mamillary body volume  standard error was 213  58 mm3 in Wernicke patients 401  37 mm3 in Alzheimer patients and 517  25 mm3 in control patients Seven of nine 78 patients with chronic Wernickes encephalopathy had smaller mamillary bodies than 36 of 37 control patients and 7 of 7 Alzheimer patients The decrease in mamillary body volume was related neither to patient age nor to degree of ventricular enlargement and most likely reflects the mamillary body atrophy that is grossly apparent at autopsy in up to 81 of Wernicke patients This technique provides a means of identifying the most specific macroscopic lesion of chronic Wernickes encephalopathy
S35	The effects of acetylethylcholine mustard AechM on the muscarinic receptor coupled adenylate cyclase system of intact GH3 cells were investigated The concentration of AechM and Ach that inhibited specific 3HNmethylscopolamine binding by 50 was similar for both compounds 93 microM for Ach and 107 microM for AechM Pretreatment of intact GH3 cells or isolated membranes with 10 to 50 microM AechM followed by washing reduced the 3HNmethylscopolamine binding capacity by 60 and 7577 respectively without changing the KD value for the radioligand to the remaining receptors Both AechM and Ach attenuated forskolin 1 microM stimulated cAMP formation with halfmaximal effects EC50 occurring at 084 microM for Ach and 024 microM for AechM The maximal inhibition was 7080 for Ach and 3040 for AechM However the doseresponse for AechM was biphasic such that at high concentrations greater than 50 microM there was a reduction in its ability to attenuate cAMP formation After 3 min incubation with either Ach or AechM the addition of atropine completely reversed their inhibitory effect even though with AechM there was a greater than 50 reduction in receptor capacity Furthermore over a 12min incubation Ach produced a relatively stable 6776 reduction in cAMP accumulation whereas with AechM the initial attenuation was gradually reduced such that by 10 min of incubation no effect was observed Finally pretreatment with AechM resulted in a reduced sensitivity to the action of Ach as the EC50 values for inhibition of cAMP accumulation were increased 76 and 135fold respectively with little or no change in the maximal response The data indicate that AechM produces a transient agonist effect to attenuate cAMP formation in intact GH3 cells followed by an antagonist action probably after irreversible binding to the receptor
S36	Hemangiomas of the temporal bone are uncommon benign tumours occurring most frequently at two sites the internal auditory meatus IAM and the geniculate ganglion In this paper the authors discuss the pathology clinical onset and features and the therapeutic management of two of these lesions A review of the literature is also presented paying attention to the controversy regarding the origin pathogenesis and histologic classification of this rare lesion of the temporal bone
S37	Tumor necrosis factor TNF is a potent cytokine mediator of the shock states associated with sepsis and burn injury This experimental study was done to determine whether circulating TNF plays a major role in the vasomotor collapse seen following experimental hemorrhage and blunt injury Twenty anesthetized pigs were divided into two groups Ten animals were bled 60 of their calculated blood volume in 15 minutes Animals in Group IA n  5 had no treatment and Group IB animals n  5 were given twice the shed volume as crystalloid 30 minutes after hemorrhage The other animals groups IIa and IIb n  5 each were first subjected to a blunt injury to the thigh sufficient to cause a midshaft femur fracture then bled and similarly treated In both groups mean arterial pressure MAP cardiac output CO and serum TNF activity by L929 bioassay were measured at 15minute intervals for 120 minutes after hemorrhage or hemorrhage and blunt injury An additional three animals were infused with 4 x 108kg heatkilled E coli to validate the TNF assay All bled animals sustained a fall in MAP and CO to a mean of 33 of baseline values with or without fracture Group IB and IIB animals responded to fluid resuscitation by restoration of MAP and CO to 8597 of the baseline values Tumor necrosis factor was not detectable before injury and remained undetectable in all these animals during the 120 minutes of the experiment despite hemorrhage alone or combined hemorrhage and blunt trauma with or without fluid resuscitation The test animals receiving the E coli responded with markedly elevated TNF levels which peaked at 90 minutes after injectionABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S38	Gallstones from 63 patients were evaluated by in vitro 15T MR imaging with T1 and T2weighted images and in 14 cases a fatsuppression sequence shortT1 inversion recovery imaging Subsequent chemical analysis was performed on 43 gallstones In vitro proton MR spectroscopy was performed on 14 stones On T1weighted MR images foci of increased signal were seen in 46 of 63 stones faint in 17 moderate in nine and bright in 20 T2weighted images showed areas of increased signal in 18 of 63 stones faint in 15 moderate in three T1weighted MR imaging patterns were homogeneously dark 17 homogeneously bright two homogeneously faint three rimmed dark rim and bright center 32 and laminated nine ShortT1 inversion recovery imaging suppressed the foci of increased signal in 13 of 14 cases Despite imaging characteristics suggestive of high lipid content spectroscopy revealed only a single peak corresponding to a large waterproton signal The T1 relaxation times of the water were shortened ranging from 0006 to 092 sec explaining the increased signal seen on MR images of the gallstones MR imaging characteristics signal intensity relative signal area or imaging patterns did not correlate with chemical composition We hypothesize that different structural relationships must exist within gallstones of similar chemical content that alter the water bonding and hence the MR imaging characteristics
S39	An aggregate of partially purified bovine bone morphogenetic protein bBMP and bone matrix insoluble noncollagenous proteins iNCP weighing a total of 100 mg of lyophilized BMPiNCP was implanted using ultra thin gelatin capsules in skull trephine defects in adult sheep One hundred milligram samples of freezedried bovine serum albumin BSA were similarly implanted for controls In five sheep the capsules were implanted in 1820 mm trephine skull defects and also in posterior cervical muscle pouches for heterotopic controls In two out of five sheep the trephines were repaired with bone as early as four weeks after the operation Eight to 12 weeks after surgery repair was complete in the other three sheep In the control contralateral trephines onethird to onehalf of the defect was incompletely repaired Neither the BMP nor the BSA control implants induced bone formation in the muscle While the BMPiNCP prepared from bovine bone consistently induced regeneration in skull trephine defects only fibrous tissue and no extraskeletal bone was induced to form in cervical muscle pouches in sheep
S40	The permeability of intercellular spaces within the anterior pituitary AP and the influence of folliculostellate FS cells on compartmentalization within this tissue has become a matter of debate In reaggregated pituitary cell cultures as well as in the AP in situ the intercellular gaps and folliclelike structures remain accessible to molecular diffusion whereas in some studies FS cells were reported to form tight epithelia that impede macromolecular transport through the spaces between the epithelial cells In the present study the permeability of AP cell reaggregates was examined using fluorescent BSA as a tracer Using confocal scanning laser microscopy a direct visualization of the permeation process was achieved Quantitative estimation of the effective diffusion coefficient Deff for fluoresceinBSA within the aggregates was obtained using the fluorescence photobleaching recovery technique Deff was 133  031 x 107 cm2sec mean  SD in aggregates from 14dayold female rats and 245  055 x 107 cm2sec in aggregates from adult female rats These values are about three times lower than in free solution Calculation of the timedependent concentration distribution inside the aggregate for a Deff  2 x 107 cm2sec revealed that the concentration of the fluorescent tracer in the center of the aggregate reaches 90 of the concentration outside the aggregate after 05 min for aggregates with a radius of 50 microns and 6 min for aggregates with a radius of 150 microns Aggregates enriched in FS cells in which we previously showed a sustained inhibition of secretory responses to stimulatory and inhibitory agents as compared to total population aggregates showed a diffusion coefficient Deff  185  077 x 107 cm2sec which was not significantly different from that in the total population aggregates The present study shows that AP cell aggregates are fully permeable to diffusing molecules within minutes and that in a threedimensional tissue configuration FS cells which were reported to tonically inhibit AP hormone release in response to various secretagogues do not impede molecular diffusion to an extent which would account for sustained inhibition of hormone release
S41	We retrospectively reviewed 16 patients in whom primary retroperitoneal liposarcoma was diagnosed and treated These patients were classified according to the first definitive surgical procedure employed complete excision with or without radiotherapy partial excision followed by radiotherapy only biopsy of tumor followed by radiotherapy Distribution of tumors according to histologic type was well differentiated myxoid type 10 poorly differentiated myxoid type 4 and mixed type 2 The main factor in determining resectability was extent and fixation of tumor to vital structures Recurrent retroperitoneal disease developed in four patients all of whom underwent secondary intervention We concluded from our experience that complete surgical excision is the most effective primary therapeutic approach for patients with primary and recurrent retroperitoneal liposarcoma
S42	In this study we investigated the regulation of insulinlike growth factor II gene expression to explain a role for this growth factor in concert with hepatitis B virus involvement in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma from cirrhosis Sections of normal liver and tumor and nontumorbearing liver disease tissue were hybridized in situ with 35Slabeled insulinlike growth factor II oligonucleotide probe Parallel sections were tested for presence of insulinlike growth factor II polypeptide using immunohistochemistry To investigate a possible role for hepatitis B virus in insulinlike growth factor II gene expression in hepatocellular carcinoma results were analyzed against patient seropositivity for hepatitis B virus Levels of insulinlike growth factor II transcripts in normal liver n  4 sections and in those from nontumorbearing individuals n  10 were so low that specific signal was not detectable above homogeneous tissue background In contrast 4 of 8 50 of the sections of hepatocellular carcinoma arising from cirrhosis or noncirrhotic chronic liver disease with hepatitis B virus involvement showed increased expression of insulinlike growth factor II messenger RNA transcripts Upregulation was observed in cell foci in the hepatocellular regions of the surrounding cirrhotic lobular cells and the fibrous septa Numerous cell foci were observed in patch distribution in the tumor areas The level of insulinlike growth factor II messenger RNA transcripts in sections of hepatocellular carcinoma arising from cirrhotic and noncirrhotic tissues obtained from patients seronegative for hepatitis B virus was similar to that of normal liverABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S43	In a study designed to determine the protective effect of the specific histamine H1 antagonist terfenadine on hypertonic saline induced bronchoconstriction 10 asthmatic subjects underwent hypertonic saline challenge 36 after premedication with placebo or terfenadine 120 mg 12 and two hours before the challenge Hypertonic saline was administered in a dose dependent manner and the response determined as the dose of hypertonic saline that induced a 20 fall in FEV1 PD20 FEV1 FEV1 was on average 11 greater with terfenadine than with placebo given before the challenge with hypertonic saline PD20 FEV1 was attenuated by a mean of 25 fold after terfenadine geometric mean PD20 FEV1 was 22 litres after placebo and 56 l after terfenadine There was substantial intersubject variation in the inhibitory effect of terfenadine on hypertonic saline induced bronchoconstriction the ratio of the PD20 hypertonic saline after terfenadine to that after placebo ranged from 09 to 100 Terfenadine inhibited histamine induced bronchoconstriction in the eight subjects in whom it was tested by 13 to 160 fold compared with placebo in four subjects and by greater than 2 to greater than 9 fold in the four who showed no response to the highest dose of histamine given 16 mgml These results suggest that histamine release has a role in hypertonic saline induced bronchoconstriction in some individuals other mediators or mechanisms may have a more prominent role in others
S44	Nocturnal penile tumescence recordings were performed in 10 men with major depression and 10 agematched healthy control subjects to evaluate the possibility that clinical disturbances in sexual interest and activity often reported by depressed persons are associated with objective changes in sexual neurophysiology Depressed men had significantly reduced minutes of tumescence time a finding that was not attributable to alterations in sleep efficiency or REM sleep time Three depressed men had baseline tumescence profiles suggestive of organogenic impotence which improved after recovery The authors discuss the implications of such findings for clinical practice and future research
S45	The relaxation of phenylephrinecontracted blood vessels by acetylcholine nitroprusside or atrial natriuretic factor has been linked to elevations in cyclic guanosine 35monophosphate cGMP Also 8bromocGMP can induce vascular relaxation in isolated vascular smooth muscle contracted with phenylephrine We determined whether these cGMPdependent vasodilators could relax isolated rat aortas contracted with the phorbol ester 12Otetradecanoylphorbol13acetate cGMP was measured by radioimmunoassay Acetylcholine nitroprusside and atrial natriuretic factor induced relaxation in vascular smooth muscle contracted by 12Otetradecanoylphorbol13acetate These relaxation responses were accompanied by elevations of cGMP However the sensitivity to these vasodilators was markedly decreased in phorbol estercontracted vessels compared to phenylephrinecontracted vessels Nifedipine and superoxide dismutase induced small but significant relaxations in phorbol estercontracted vessels however blood vessels contracted with phenylephrine and phorbol ester relaxed completely with papaverine There was a marked decrease in sensitivity to 8bromocGMP in phorbol estertreated vessels compared to phenylephrinecontracted vessels Contractions induced by phorbol ester were not inhibited by amiloride or chlorpromazine Also following incubation in potassiumfree salt solution vessels incubated with phenylephrine or phenylephrine and phorbol ester underwent similar relaxations when exposed to potassium chloride The contractile state induced by phorbol ester has decreased sensitivity to cGMPdependent vasodilators This may be due to nonspecific effects of the phorbol ester or to the mechanism by which protein kinase C activation maintains vascular tone
S46	The properties of mutants in the pir gene of plasmid R6K have suggested that the pi protein plays a dual role it is required for replication to occur and also plays a role in the negative control of the plasmid copy number In our present study we have found that the pi level in cell extracts of Escherichia coli strains containing R6K derivatives is surprisingly high approximately equal to 104 dimers per cell and that this level is not altered in cells carrying high copy number pir mutants The wildtype and a high copy mutant Cos405 pir gene were inserted downstream of promoters of different strengths to measure the copy number of an R6K gamma replicon as a function of a 1000fold range of intracellular pi concentrations The data demonstrate that reducing the intracellular level of pi to 5 of its normal value can result in a substantial increase in copy number of a gamma origin replicon and that a pi level less than 1 of normal is still permissive for replication Conversely increasing the pi level even a fewfold above normal results in a marked inhibition of replication of plasmids containing a single two or all three of the R6K origins alpha beta and gamma We have also shown that the replication inhibition mediated by excess pi is greatly reduced by the pir405 Cos mutation These results demonstrate that the total level of pi protein is not ratelimiting for a gamma replicon We have also determined the sensitivity of the pir gene promoter to a wide range of pi concentrations The activity of this promoter is stimulated by very low pi levels and is almost entirely inhibited when the protein is overproduced 2fold
S47	The use of temporary clipping has become an established tool in the armamentarium of the aneurysm surgeon Our experience with 62 consecutive patients is presented detailing operative protocols and results Twentytwo had unruptured aneurysms 35 15 were grade I 24 16 grade II 25 five grade III 8 and four grade IV 7 The aneurysms were mainly located in the middle cerebral artery 29 patients and the anterior communicating artery 13 patients Eleven of our 62 patients 17 developed a new persistent postoperative deficit However in only one case 2 was temporary clipping felt to be implicated in the development of the deficit In three other patients 5 the effect of temporary clipping although unlikely could not be excluded Overall 92 of our patients with temporary clipping had good to excellent outcome with 3 mortality and 5 morbidity We believe that temporary clipping is a safe procedure that contributes significantly to a better outcome
S48	The concentrations of ACTH and cortisol both rise in the plasma of fetal lambs during late pregnancy reflecting maturation of the fetal hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal axis and providing the stimulus for parturition The failure of rising cortisol to suppress plasma ACTH may be due to altered sensitivity of glucocorticoid negative feedback To examine the possibility that this effect might be mediated through changes in the number of glucocorticoid receptors GR in the fetal hypothalamus and pituitary we measured changes in GR number in these tissues from fetuses at discrete times of pregnancy between day 60 and term day 145 and from newborn lambs and adult sheep We also determined the effect of intrafetal ACTH administration in amounts known to produce premature parturition on GR number in fetuses at days 125130 of gestation Binding of 124N3Htriamcinolone acetonide to dispersed cell preparations of fetal pituitary and hypothalamus was saturable temperature dependent glucocorticoid specific and of high affinity 23 X 109 M The number of GR in the pituitary always exceeded that in the hypothalamus In both tissues GR number rose between days 6070 to highest values on days 100110 then decreased until day 125 GR number in the pituitary rose again at term paradoxically at a time of rising endogenous glucocorticoid levels However after ACTH administration there was a significant decrease in GR number in both hypothalamus and pituitary These results indicate that altered efficacy of glucocorticoid negative feedback in term fetuses is not due to a decrease in pituitary or hypothalamic GR number The rise in GR number at term and the fall after intrafetal ACTH treatment raises the possibility that mechanisms exist in the fetus allowing normal autoregulation of GR to be overridden at term
S49	The existence of chloridebicarbonate exchange across the basolateral membrane and its physiologic significance were examined in rabbit proximal tubules S2 segments of the proximal straight tubule were perfused in vitro and changes in intracellular pH pHi and chloride activity aCli were monitored by doublebarreled microelectrodes Total peritubular chloride replacement with gluconate increased pHi by 08 and this change was inhibited by a pretreatment with an anion transport inhibitor SITS Peritubular bicarbonate reduction increased aCli and most of this increase was lost when ambient sodium was totally removed The reduction rates of pHi induced by a peritubular bicarbonate reduction or sodium removal were attenuated by 20 by withdrawal of ambient chloride SITS application to the bath in the control condition quickly increased pHi but did not change aCli However the aCli slightly decreased in response to SITS when the basolateral bicarbonate efflux was increased by reducing peritubular bicarbonate concentration It is concluded that sodium coupled chloridebicarbonate exchange is present in parallel with sodiumbicarbonate cotransport in the basolateral membrane of the rabbit proximal tubule and it contributes to the basolateral bicarbonate and chloride transport
S50	The breast containing an augmentation implant presents a challenge to the mammographer and is often considered unsuitable for adequate mammographic evaluation A modified positioning technique is described By displacing the implant posteriorly against the chest wall and pulling breast tissue over and in front of the implant marked improvement in compression and visualization of substantially more breast tissue is achieved Over 250 patients with augmentation implants have been successfully studied with this modified compression technique After review of 50 consecutive cases two experienced mammographers confirmed a significant improvement in image quality amount of breast tissue visualized and overall benefit of the modified technique Modified positioning for women with breast implants substantially improves both image quality and amount of breast tissue imaged
S51	Evidence is presented that cytochrome P450 catalyzes the reductive cleavage of hydroperoxides For example in a reconstituted system containing rabbit liver microsomal P450 form 2 NADPHcytochrome P450 reductase and NADPH cumyl hydroperoxide yields acetophenone and methane but no cumyl alcohol is formed The stoichiometry of the reaction and similar results with alphamethylbenzyl benzyl and tbutyl hydroperoxides are in accord with the following general equation in which X represents an alkyl group and R and R are either alkyl groups or hydrogen atoms in the starting peroxide XRRCOOH  NADPH  HXRCO  RH  H2O  NADP Because 13hydroperoxy911octadecadienoic acid yields pentane under these conditions we propose that the known formation of alkanes and aldehydes in membrane lipid peroxidation involves reductive cleavage by P450 to give the products predicted by the above equation The cleavage reaction is thought to involve stepwise oneelectron transfer resulting in homolysis of the peroxide oxygenoxygen bond and generation of an alkoxy radical with betascission of the latter followed by reduction of the secondary radical to the hydrocarbon In accordance with this scheme when the cleavage reaction with cumyl hydroperoxide was done in 2H2O deuteromethane was formed
S52	Computed tomographic CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI views of the brain were obtained in two adults and one child with hypertensive encephalopathy HTE Noncontrast CT was normal in one case and demonstrated decreased density posteriorly in two cases MRI demonstrated focal symmetric increased signal intensity in white matter and cortex with occipital lobe involvement in each case These lesions were better visualized on T2weighted than on spin density images and were resolved on followup MRI four to five weeks later These MRI studies support the concept that HTE is caused by the multifocal extravasation of fluid and proteins across the bloodbrain barrier during breakthrough of cerebral autoregulation We found that MRI appears more sensitive than CT and better defines the anatomy of cerebral involvement in HTE
S53	Twelve types of phototherapy eyeshields showed peak light transmission of less than 01 and none transmitted greater than 004 light in the 460 nm spectral region Commercial eyeshields offered no advantage over locally made ones The choice of shield may be less important than how it is secured over the infants eyes
S54	The pharmacokinetics of pentoxifylline were investigated in six healthy volunteers and in 10 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis After a 100 mg intravenous infusion pentoxifylline elimination halflife was prolonged in cirrhotic patients 212  122 hours versus 083  029 hours p less than 005 because of a decrease in its plasma clearance 144  046 Lhr1kg1 in patients with cirrhosis versus 362  075 Lhr1kg1 in volunteers p less than 0001 The elimination halflife of the metabolite 5hydroxypentoxifylline was similar to that of the parent compound After oral administration of a 400 mg sustainedreleased tablet absolute bioavailability of pentoxifylline increased in cirrhotic patients 071  024 versus 033  013 p less than 001 Although plasma concentrations of pentoxifylline and hydroxypentoxifylline were significantly increased in cirrhotic patients the AUCpentoxifyllineAUChydroxypentoxifylline ratio remained unchanged in both groups after either intravenous or oral administration These findings show that liver cirrhosis profoundly alters the pharmacokinetics of pentoxifylline However the formation of hydroxypentoxifylline is not modified in these patients suggesting an extrahepatic metabolism
S55	Oesophageal pH monitoring data are influenced by numerous patient or technique related factors or both In this study data recorded with glass microelectrodes or antimony electrodes both with external cutaneous AgAgCl reference electrodes connected to two different recording devices are compared Pearson correlation coefficients regarding the reflux index  of the investigation time with a pH less than 4 ranged from poor to excellent 055 to 100 Differences in data recorded with glass electrodes are not significantly dependent on the recording device r093 to 100 for the reflux index The correlation between data simultaneously recorded with antimony electrodes is lower although not significantly different for the reflux index 090 Correlation between data recorded with glass and antimony probes is rather poor 055 to 070 Therefore data recorded with antimony electrodes cannot be compared with those recorded with glass electrodes The mean pH recorded with glass electrodes is lower than that with antimony probes
S56	Investigation of frequent urinary tract infections 2 months after an accident in which a man sustained pelvic fractures and a head injury revealed a large pseudodiverticulum between the left bladder wall and pelvis and extending inferiorly and medially through the separated symphysis pubis into the upper left thigh
S57	One hundred and sixteen cases of adult patients hospitalized for shigellosis have been reviewed The most common presentation included diarrhea most frequently watery fever and abdominal pain while dysentery has been less frequent S flexneri infection as compared to S sonnei was more common in elderly patients and in males and was characterized by a more prolonged clinical course Abnormalities of serum electrolytes and hepatic enzymes were the most common laboratory complications most often seen in elderly patients Most isolates exhibited susceptibility to the common antimicrobial agents used in shigellosis therapy
S58	Intravenous administration of human immunoglobulin has been shown to have clinical efficacy in the treatment of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura Physicians who use this remarkable clinical tool face the dilemma of balancing the safety and efficacy of therapy against the cost which is higher than that of the more toxic forms of therapy Costeffectiveness studies of specific clinical situations indicate that costs for children are decreased by a shortened hospital stay the need for less antibiotic therapy and avoidance of splenectomy Therapy for adults must be individualized and varies depending on whether the goal is a rapid platelet response eg before emergency surgery or avoidance of the risks of corticosteroid therapy and splenectomy The availability of a safe immunomodulating agent makes intravenous immunoglobulin therapy a potentially useful tool for a wide variety of diseases
S59	A method of repairing split earlobes preserving the hole is presented It is simple sound has a good cosmetic appearance and is more resistant to recurrence of the split than other methods
S60	5Aminosalicylic acid the therapeutically active metabolite of sulfasalazine was exposed to oxygenderived free radicals produced by the Fenton reaction in vitro and several metabolites were detected and characterized by high performance liquid chromatography and ultraviolet spectrophotometry The majority of these metabolites were present in methanolic extracts of feces samples from sulfasalazinetreated patients with inflammatory bowel disease but not in rheumatoid arthritis patients with normal bowel function The presence of these metabolites which have not been demonstrated in vivo before provides evidence of an interaction between 5aminosalicylic acid and oxygenderived free radicals in sulfasalazinetreated patients with inflammatory bowel disease Since the concentration of lipid peroxides which is dependent on the release of oxygenderived free radicals was significantly increased in pretreatment rectal biopsies of the patients and further was normalized concomitantly with a significant improvement in disease activity over the 5wk treatment period an important role of the radical scavenger mechanism of 5aminosalicylic acid in sulfasalazine therapy of chronic inflammatory bowel disease is strongly suggested
S61	The selection of infant feeding method was studied in a rural area At discharge from the hospital 70 percent of women were breast feeding with 47 percent still breast feeding at three months The decision regarding feeding method was made early with the majority of women deciding before the pregnancy Multiparous women almost always used the method that was favored by their experience feeding previous children For primiparous women the husband and mother were the most important sources of information Educational efforts designed to increase the use of breast feeding should reach future parents prior to pregnancy and every effort should be made to ensure that the first experience with breast feeding is successful and rewarding
S62	Serious nonthyroid illness and caloric deprivation which so often accompany systemic illness have diverse and still incompletely understood effects on thyroid hormone economy We have discussed the pathophysiologic basis for the most common pattern of alterations in routine thyroid function tests a decreased serum T3 concentration normal or in critically ill patients a low total serum T4 level and a normal free T4 concentration Another less frequent pattern high total and free T4 with a normal serum T3 can be encountered transiently in the acutely ill medical or psychiatric patient With the recent advent of sensitive assays for TSH and better methods for serum free T4 it is now possible to define more quickly and accurately the thyroidmetabolic status of most of these sick patients the vast majority are euthyroid Certain drugs confound the picture The most important of these include dopamine and highdose glucocorticoids both of which suppress TSH secretion from the pituitary and may actually cause a state of central hypothyroidism Other drugs have multiple effects on thyroid hormone indices eg amiodarone Knowledge of all of the ways in which systemic illness starvation and certain drugs may influence thyroid function tests is crucial in assessing the thyroid status of patients with serious nonthyroid disease
S63	Opportunistic disseminated strongyloidiasis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients However the worldwide prevalence of Strongyloides stercoralis is difficult to determine because adequate data are lacking In this paper more than 100 epidemiologic studies reporting on the prevalence of S stercoralis among various populations on five continents are critically reviewed Analysis of this information indicates that the following groups of people may be at risk residents of an emigrants from any developing country and southern eastern and central Europe travelers and veterans returning from endemic areas natives and residents of the Appalachian region in the United States and local endemic areas in other countries and institutionalized persons Because disseminated infections may be prevented by early treatment of asymptomatic chronic infections screening programs are recommended to detect latent S stercoralis infection before the initiation of chemotherapy or immunosuppression in patients at risk Serologic tests are sensitive and specific but are not yet widely available Thus strong suspicion based on clinical and epidemiologic clues in conjunction with repeated stool examinations remains the best way to rule out S stercoralis infection in these groups
S64	Ribozymes use specific RNARNA interactions for substrate binding and activesite formation Selfsplicing group I introns have approximately 70 nucleotides constituting the core a region containing sequences and structures indispensable for catalytic function The catalytic core must interact with the substrates used for the two steps of the selfsplicing reaction that is guanosine the 5splicesite helix P1 and the 3 splice site Mutational evidence suggests that core sequences near segment J67 that joins the basepaired stems P6 and P7 and the bulged base of P75 participate in binding guanosine substrate but nothing is known about the interactions between the core the 5splicesite helix and the 3 splice site On the basis of comparative sequence data it has been suggested that two specific bases in the catalytic core of group I introns might form a binding sequence for the 3 splice site Here we present genetic evidence that such a binding site exists in the core of the Tetrahymena large subunit ribosomal RNA intron We demonstrate that this pairing termed P90 is functionally important in the exon ligation step of selfsplicing but is not itself responsible for 3splicesite selection
S65	To study the determinants of late restenosis after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty PTCA performed in patients with unstable angina pectoris a prospective study was undertaken in 90 patients Primary PTCA success was achieved in 84 93 patients dilating 116 of 118 coronary narrowings 14patient while major complications during PTCA occurred in only 1 patient 1 death Eightytwo patients 114 dilated arteries were followed for 25  11 months 68 83 were in New York Heart Association functional class I or II 11 13 in class III and there were 3 deaths Late restenosis was found in 16 25 of 65 lesions 29 of 49 patients studied by angiography 9  7 months after PTCA Restenosis was more frequent in left anterior descending coronary artery lesions p  007 and in those which at the time of PTCA had multiple irregularities 67 vs 14 odds ratio 125 p  0002 decreased coronary perfusion Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction grade less than 3 50 vs 15 odds ratio 57 p  002 or intraluminal thrombus 67 vs 19 odds ratio 87 difference not significant Multiple irregularities p  0003 and decreased flow p  002 remained independent predictors of restenosis goodness of fit 088 after adjustment for 12 pre and periPTCA clinical and angiographic variables by logistic regression analysis These data underline the feasibility of early revascularization by PTCA in patients with unstable angina pectoris Careful followup should be instituted in patients with multiple irregular lesions decreased coronary perfusion or intraluminal thrombus at the time of PTCA In such patients late restenosis may be the rule rather than the exception
S66	We have noted two previously undescribed inositol polyphosphates in neutral methanol extracts from Swiss mouse 3T3 cells that were grown in 3Hinositol and stimulated with plateletderived growth factor They have been identified as 1monomethylphosphoinositol 45bisphosphate and 1monomethylphosphoinositol 4phosphate by comparison to a synthesized standard using HPLC chromatography paper electrophoresis and enzymatic dephosphorylation with inositol polyphosphate 5phosphomonoesterase and intestinal alkaline phosphatase orthophosphoricmonoester phosphohydrolase alkaline optimum EC 3131 We propose that these compounds are formed by methanolysis of inositol 12cyclic45trisphosphate and inositol 12cyclic4bisphosphate present in the cells Inositol cyclic phosphates did not react with neutral methanol in the absence of the cells which are required for the methanolysis reaction These findings suggest a role for inositol cyclic phosphates as reactive compounds that are added to as yet unidentified cellular acceptors
S67	Serial coronal sections of 89 widefield laryngectomies were examined Twenty were specimens obtained from laryngectomies to treat patients for whom primary radiation therapy failed to cure early laryngeal cancer These specimens were compared to 69 specimens from laryngectomies for T3 and T4 laryngeal cancers The irradiationfailure group showed a significantly greater invasion of cartilage and extension into subglottic areas The extension of tumors along blood vessels and mucous glands appeared to contribute to the spread of tumors in the irradiationfailure group These findings have implications for the surgical management of irradiation failures in the treatment of laryngeal cancers
S68	Partial discectomy was done in vitro on 15 human lumbar discs from donors 2040 years of age The change of disc height radial disc bulge and intradiscal pressure was measured in relation to the mass of central disc tissue excised Disc height decreases and radial disc bulge increases approximately in proportion with the mass of the tissue excised At the same time intradiscal pressure decreases On average removal of 1 g of disc tissue results in a height decrease of 08 mm and a radial bulge increase of 02 mm Removal of 3 g of central disc tissue lowers the intradiscal pressure to approximately 40 of its initial value A mechanical model is presented which explains the observed relation between the volume of material removed and the subsequent change of height bulge and pressure The experimental results and the model provide insight into the rationale of disc pressurization A high intradiscal pressure is a prerequisite for the mechanical function of the disc under physiologic conditions
S69	An analysis of a series of 100 patients aged 60 years or over referred by their General Practitioner to the Department of Otolaryngology Addenbrookes Hospital specifically for the provision of a hearing aid is presented Fortysix per cent of patients failed to satisfy the criteria suggested by the Technicians Therapists and Scientists in Audiology as a screening for treatable pathology This study has shown that the existing referral pattern of general practitioner to consultant otolaryngologist for the provision of a hearing aid reflects the highest quality of care for the patient Direct referral or open access of patients for hearing aid fitting may risk failure to diagnose early and treatable conditions
S70	Agonist analogs of GnRH were used to effect a medical castration in 14 patients with uterine fibroids presenting with either an enlarged uterus recurrent menometrorrhagia andor infertility This study confirms prior reports of a reduction in uterine size and cessation of menometrorrhagia in patients with fibroids following treatment with GnRHa Of interest however was the successful use of GnRHa as either the sole treatment for uterine fibroidassociated infertility or as a preoperative adjunct in infertility patients scheduled for myomectomy Three of the five infertility patients in this study achieved intrauterine pregnancies Further study of the role of GnRHa treatment in infertility patients with uterine fibroids appears warranted
S71	A prospective analysis of 300 consecutively collected homologous blood HB units from a regional blood center and an analysis of 188 consecutively collected autologous blood AB units from a community hospital was conducted Analysis of the red blood cell RBC mass content of these blood units revealed that HB contained 13 percent more RBC than AB 200  11 vs 1771  11 mL m  SE respectively p less than 005 Of 174 AB units eligible for crossover by AABB criteria for RBC mass greater than or equal to 154 mL 35 20 were below the 95 percent confidence interval range for RBC mass of HB units collected mean RBC mass of 300 HB units was 12 percent greater than that of 174 AB units 2001  11 vs 1789  09 mL p less than 0001 and 20 percent greater than that of the 35 AB units outside the 95 percent confidence interval 2001  11 vs 1612  05 mL p less than 0001 These findings indicate that an evaluation of the issues of AB crossover for HB transfusion should include a riskbenefit analysis of AB units with lower RBC mass These findings also indicate that the proposed changes in AABB standards regarding directed donation DD should consider the reduced benefits of DD units with lower RBC mass in a riskbenefit analysis of this practice and support retention of homologous donor standards for directed donors
S72	Flexible cystoscopy via a suprapubic cystostomy tract was utilized to locate the proximal segment of a complete traumatic disruption of the bulbar urethra secondary to a pelvic fracture With the fiberoptic light of the instrument visible in the perineum the proximal urethra was easily and safely dissected free from the enveloping fibrotic scar tissue and a simple onestage urethroplasty performed The patient is voiding normally eight months postoperatively
S73	We assessed the capacity of preformed confluent endothelial cell EC monolayers on smallcaliber prosthetic grafts to prevent early platelet deposition in a baboon model Cultured human umbilical vein ECs were attached to expanded polytetrafluoroethylene GoreTex 4 mm inner diameter 3 cm length precoated with type I collagen and perfused in vitro for 2 hours at 15 mlmin with serumcontaining culture medium to achieve cell spreading into confluent monolayers Cell numbers were quantified by deoxyribonucleic acid assay or isotopic counting of indium 111labeled ECs Saturation density for cell attachment was 355  029 x 105 cells per square centimeter of graft After 1 hour of in vitro perfusion at 100 mlmin 928  18 of cells remained attached and the flow surface was morphologically confluent When grafts were inserted as extension segments into arteriovenous silicone rubber Silastic shunts in baboons thereby exposing the endothelialized grafts to native flowing blood 100 mlmin for 1 hour the EC monolayers remained confluent with 8105  588 of the cells attached Indium 111labeled platelet deposition onto grafts was quantified by dynamic scintillation camera imaging Platelet deposition on 10 endothelialized grafts was markedly reduced 016  004 x 109 platelets per graft compared with 10 untreated control grafts 184  059 x 109 platelets p less than 002 eight grafts with early attached unspread ECs 238  066 x 109 platelets p less than 0005 and 11 grafts treated with collagen alone 593  072 x 109 platelets p less than 0002ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S74	Eighteen lymphoceles developed after 199 renal transplantations 11 being asymptomatic Ultrasound was the most sensitive method of detection Seven lymphoceles were symptomatic pelvic mass and decreased renal function being the most frequent signs Five lymphoceles were successfully treated by instillation of iodate povidone into the lymphatic cavity there were no complications or recurrences This is a simple safe and inexpensive method for the treatment of lymphoceles after renal transplantation
S75	The complexity of the congestive heart failure syndrome often calls for a complete evaluation of the patients cardiovascular status Determination of the cause detection and grading of surgically treatable lesions assessment of diastolic dysfunction and development of a therapeutic plan generally require diagnostic cardiac catheterization andor placement of a flowdirected pulmonary artery catheter Each procedure has its value and its limitations
S76	Fetal heart rate and fetal movements were recorded in 16 uncomplicated nearterm pregnancies The recordings were used to evaluate a system for automated fetal heart rate analysis Sonicaid System 8000 Fetal restactivity patterns were considered in the analysis The mean duration of C2F periods active sleep 33 minutes was significantly greater than that of C1F periods quiet sleep 19 minutes p less than 0001 The incidence of accelerations and decelerations and the overall fetal heart rate variations were greater during C2F than during C1F p less than 0001 In 11 of 16 C1F periods the system classified the fetal heart rate variation as questionable or abnormal Episodes of high variation were identified in only 3 of 16 C1F periods but they were found in all 18 C2F periods Episodes of low variation were identified in 14 of the 16 C1F periods but were not found in any C2F periods During C2F periods the systems criteria of normality were met in all cases but one they were not met during any of the C1F periods Thus the diagnosis of fetal distress should not be based merely on the absence of accelerations low fetal heart rate variation or absence of episodes of high variation in recordings with a duration of less than 45 minutes
S77	Betahexosaminidase also called NacetylbetaDglucosaminidase is a lysosomal glycosidase which has been found to be increased in the sera of alcoholics admitted to acute detoxification treatment To study serum betahexosaminidase betaHEX as a marker of heavy drinking it was compared with GGT ASAT and ALAT in three study groups twentyfive drunken arrestees 16 social drinkers and 27 teetotallers Mean serum betaHEX levels were two times higher among drunken arrestees than among social drinkers or teetotallers Average daily alcohol intake during the preceding 30 days in the pooled group of drunken arrestees and social drinkers correlated positively r  069 p less than 00001 with serum betaHEX The sensitivity of betaHEX in the detection of heavy drinking defined as over 60 g ethanol daily was 857 compared to 476 for GGT The specificity of betaHEX was 976 The positive correlations between betaHEX and ASAT r  074 p less than 00001 and ALAT r  041 p less than 005 indicate that increased serum betaHEX level may reflect early liver injury Serum betaHEX seems to be a sensitive biological marker of heavy drinking reflecting better the ingested amounts of alcohol than GGT
S78	In a review of 5424 colonoscopies performed in the last ten years at BronxLebanon Hospital Center 14 perforations related to the procedure were found Seven perforations occurred during therapeutic colonoscopies polypectomies and seven during diagnostic colonoscopies Eight patients were treated surgically and six nonsurgically The decision about whether or not to perform surgery for a colonoscopically induced perforation depends on the clinical condition of the patient Nonsurgical management is indicated if the patients general condition remains stable if the perforation has been diagnosed late if the pneumoperitoneum that led to the diagnosis does not increase in size if there are no signs of peritonitis if the patient does not have a distal obstruction and if the patients condition improves in response to conservative treatment
S79	Demand oxygen systems have been shown to be effective in treating hypoxemia during seated rest and during exercise but the performance of these systems during sleep has not been previously studied We compared the efficacy of a new demand oxygen saver system with that of continuous flow nasal oxygen during the usual activities of daily life including sleep seated rest and exercise Six hypoxemic patients were studied All six had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease though one patient had kyphoscoliosis with mixed obstructive and restrictive lung disease Patients were studied during each activity of daily life while receiving supplemental oxygen by continuous flow nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute and during use of the demand oxygen saver system The demand oxygen system produced arterial oxygenation equivalent to continuous flow nasal cannula under all conditions while utilizing substantially less oxygen When compared with administration of oxygen by continuous flow nasal cannula the demand oxygen saver cannula utilized only 45 percent as much oxygen during seated rest 44 percent as much oxygen during exercise and 39 percent as much oxygen during sleep Our data support the use of demand oxygen systems for treatment of hypoxemia in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease
S80	Two metalloproteases have been purified from human articular cartilage These attack the core protein of proteoglycan with pH optima of 53 and 72 The acid protease retains 40 of its activity at physiological pH The two proteases are related in their properties of latency activation substrate specificity and inhibitor pattern They differ in pI pH optimum molecular weight calcium requirement and action on gelatin Both activities are elevated 35 fold in osteoarthritic cartilage Both proteases attack AlaLeu and TyrLeu bonds in the Bchain of insulin It is postulated that the entire family of metalloproteases acting on extracellular matrix shares a common specificity for GlyAlaLeuIle bonds
S81	Phagocytes may shelter intracellular pathogens from the otherwise lethal effects of many antibiotics Research in conditions such as chronic granulomatous disease tuberculosis legionellosis and experimental staphylococcal infection underscores the principle that an antibiotic must enter the cell in order to be active against an intracellular microorganism Demonstrating entry does not guarantee activity however The microenvironment and intracellular distribution of the pathogen and antimicrobial agent and interactions between agent pathogen and host cell all contribute to determining the treatment result
S82	We present a series of 13 patients with diffuse carcinoma in situ CIS of the bladder who failed an initial induction course of intravesical therapy with Mitomycin C thiotepa doxorubicin or Bacillus Calmette Guerin BCG Cystectomy although indicated was for various reasons not performed after the first failure of intravesical therapy and all patients were subsequently treated topically with the same or different agents Of the 7 patients treated with 2 induction courses 6 showed a complete response during a followup period of 24 to 42 months Although 1 patient initially responded completely he developed invasive transitional cell carcinoma TCC Grade IV 30 months later Among the 3 patients who underwent 3 induction courses 2 had a complete response at 42 and 60 months of followup and 1 developed TCC Grade IV with muscle invasion 18 months later Two of the 3 patients treated with 4 induction courses are free of disease at 48 and 57 months the third developed low grade low stage TCC This experience suggests that the majority of patients with CIS who fail initial treatment usually respond to further treatment with the same or a different drug The question as to whether a second course of intravesical therapy subsequent to failure of the first course should be given before cystectomy requires further investigation
S83	In a previous study we have demonstrated that human epidermal Langerhans cells LC are induced to express Fc epsilon R2CD23 by stimulation with IL4 andor IFNgamma In this study using LCenriched and LCdepleted epidermal cell EC cultures we have shown that stimulation with IL4 andor IFNgamma not only led to Fc epsilon R2CD23 expression on normal human LC but also to the release of significant amounts of IgEBF soluble CD23 Furthermore stimulation with IL4 was more effective in induction of Fc epsilon R2CD23 on LC when compared to IFNgamma which in contrast strongly promoted the release of IgEBF These results indicate that Fc epsilon R2CD23positive LC represent a potential source of IgEBF and that as is observed in monocytes or U937 cells IFNgamma and IL4 differently regulate the Fc epsilon R2CD23 expression and release on LC
S84	Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans a fastidious gramnegative bacillus has been reported as the cause of prosthetic valve endocarditis in 11 patients Two additional patients are reported and the literature is reviewed All cases occurred greater than 1 year after implantation of the prosthesis Six of the 13 patients had had recent dental work or had poor dentition Three patients had received endocarditis prophylaxis Ten of 13 were cured with antibiotics alone Only one patient suffered from congestive heart failure and only one had documented evidence of major systemic emboli during antimicrobial therapy Valve replacement was necessary in only two during antimicrobial therapy A actinomycetemcomitans should be considered as a possible etiologic agent in late prosthetic valve endocarditis particularly when blood cultures are initially negative A regimen of a betalactam antibiotic in combination with an aminoglycoside is recommended for 46 weeks The excellent in vitro activity of the thirdgeneration cephalosporins and rifampin promise new therapeutic options
S85	There is a large array of additional urodynamic tests to be used as an adjunct to cystometry Although each in theory is useful good clinical practice dictates that such testing be used only if clarification of diagnosis is needed or if a change in management due to test results is anticipated Submitting every patient referred for urodynamic evaluation to the same battery of tests regardless of the individuals symptoms is to be discouraged
S86	A 74yearold woman with a primary thyroid plasmacytoma was studied Clinical signs included a mass in the neck as well as muscle and skin involvement due to dermatomyositis In her serum a monoclonal IgG lambda was present Immunohistochemistry showed an intracellular monoclonal IgG lambda component After thyroid surgery and radiation clinical improvement and fall of M protein were noted On longterm followup only palmar fasciitis persisted
S87	The diagnosis and management of prostatitis and pelviperineal pain is a challenge to the clinician Careful examination of the prostatic fluid and bacteriologic cultures to differentiate bacterial from nonbacterial prostatitis are essential Antimicrobial therapy is effective in the majority of men with acute or chronic bacterial prostatitis Nonbacterial prostatitis is the most common type of prostatitis The etiology is unknown and treatment with repeated antimicrobial therapy is ineffective Alphablocking agents may relieve symptomatology Pelviperineal pain may be of prostatic origin but other nonprostatic causes should be sought
S88	The sulfhydryl reducing agent cysteamine is known to functionally inactive prolactin and other neurohormones that have been recently shown to play a role as immunomodulators Cysteamine was administered to mice to evaluate its effects upon immune organ size and mitogeninduced lymphocyte proliferative responses in relation to corresponding effects on the immunomodulatory hormones prolactin and corticosterone The lowest dose of cysteamine 125 mgkg given once per day for 3 consecutive days produced significant elevations of both concanavalin ACon A and lipopolysaccharideinduced blastogenesis Serum prolactin levels were also significantly elevated with 125 mgkg cysteamine By contrast at 300 and 400 mgkg cysteamine significantly reduced Con A and lipopolysaccharideinduced proliferation This suppression of mitogeninduced proliferative responses was accompanied by marked atrophy of the thymus Levels of both prolactin and corticosterone in the serum were significantly reduced at 400 mgkg cysteamine A positive correlation was observed between serum prolactin levels and Con Ainduced proliferation as well as between serum prolactin and corticosterone levels in cysteaminetreated mice The immunomodulatory effects of cysteamine were not limited to correlative effects on neuroendocrine parameters A similar pattern of effects was observed following in vitro administration of cysteamine Low concentrations in vitro 01 mM stimulated Con Ainduced proliferation of normal mouse splenocytes and higher concentrations in vitro 20 mM suppressed proliferation These studies indicate that depending upon the dose cysteamine has bidirectional effects on mitogeninduced proliferation of lymphocytes these effects are correlated with cysteaminerelated alterations in the neuroendocrine status of the animal but may also be observed with direct addition of the drug to stimulated lymphocytes in culture
S89	Nineteen patients with afferent pupillary defects APDs from a variety of lesions were examined using a brighter and dimmer test light A denser neutral density filter was required to balance the afferent defect using the brighter test light in every case For quantitation of an afferent defect to have meaning the test light used must be specified An indirect ophthalmoscope set to 6 V and held 1 foot from the eyes will allow easier detection of subtle relative APDs than it will if set to 3 V
S90	Both porcine PX and bovine pericardial BP valves have been used in the implantable Novacor left ventricular assist system LVAS Results from 58 chronic LVAS implants of greater than 7 days in calves and adult sheep are presented the PX valve was used in 41 and the BP in 17 With PX valves the maximum and mean assist durations were 161 and 54 days respectively in the calf and 279 and 129 days respectively in the sheep The maximum and mean durations for BP valves were 93 and 38 days calf and 153 and 69 days sheep In bovine studies with PX valves severe obstructive pseudoneointimal PNI proliferation in the Dacron inflow conduit was the primary cause for termination valves exhibited moderate calcification With BP valves both PNI proliferation and severe valve calcification contributed to a declining pump output leading to termination In contrast to the bovine experience PNI proliferation was not observed in ovine implants BP valves still became calcified as evidenced by a progressive decline in pump output from about twelve weeks and confirmed at termination Valve calcification was minimal with the PX valves even at 236 days These results favor the adult ovine animal model for extended implants
S91	Proteinuria is a laboratory finding that can have a wide range of clinical meanings so a knowledgeable diagnostic approach is extremely important The condition is transient in some patients and they should be spared the negative psychological and financial impact that aggressive evaluation can cause Alternatively proteinuria can be the first sign of meaningful renal disease and early assessment can help prevent renal failure The ability to decide who needs further testing is an important skill
S92	A number of designationsfor example excision wide excision lumpectomy tylectomy extended tylectomy partial mastectomy tumorectomy segmental resection and quadrantectomyhave been applied to operative procedures aimed at treating mammary carcinoma with preservation of the breast None of them however has been explicitly linked to a defined surgical technique and there is no consensus about the terminology We propose a simple classification system for breastconserving procedures which can facilitate the communication between surgeons and the interpretation and exchange of scientific data We also describe a strictly defined and locally radical partial mastectomya sector resectionwhich has been used at several centres in Sweden for more than 5 years with a favourable outcome so far in terms of local tumour control and the cosmetic result
S93	In an attempt to overcome limitations inherent in conventional computeraided diagnosis investigators have created programs that simulate expert human reasoning Hopes that such a strategy would lead to clinically useful programs have not been fulfilled but many of the problems impeding creation of effective artificial intelligence programs have been solved Strategies have been developed to limit the number of hypotheses that a program must consider and to incorporate pathophysiologic reasoning The latter innovation permits a program to analyze cases in which one disorder influences the presentation of another Prototypes embodying such reasoning can explain their conclusions in medical terms that can be reviewed by the user Despite these advances further major research and developmental efforts will be necessary before expert performance by the computer becomes a reality
S94	Arteriovenous fistulae affecting the proximal portions of the superior mesenteric vessels are extremely rare We are reporting one such fistula which occurred in a young male as a sequel to a stab in the epigastrium The arteriovenous fistula was successfully treated by percutaneous steel coil embolization
S95	The potential for cimetidine to alter the metabolism of carbaryl has been investigated in the isolated perfused rat liver and in man In the isolated perfused rat liver carbaryl was removed by a high intrinsic clearance process which was inhibited in a dose dependent fashion by cimetidine in the concentration range of 60240 microgramsml The pharmacokinetic profile in one subject for orally administered carbaryl was altered following administration of cimetidine 200 mg every eight hours for three days The peak carbaryl level occurred 25 minutes later and was increased by twofold due to a 46 reduction in apparent oral clearance The observations indicate that cimetidine can inhibit the metabolism of carbaryl in both rat and man These data suggest that administration of cimetidine to individuals exposed to carbaryl could result in enhanced toxicity
S96	Penicillamine shows some structural similarities to carbocysteine The ability to oxidize carbocysteine ie the sulfoxidation status shows a bimodal distribution in the general population In this study sulfoxidation status was determined in 50 of 60 rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving penicillamine We found that poor sulfoxidation status compared with good sulfoxidation status was associated with a 39 times higher incidence of toxicity
S97	The electrocardiograms of 2 patients with frequent premature ventricular complexes characterized by variable coupling intervals and fusions with sinus activations were analyzed according to the modulated parasystole and reflection hypotheses of Moe et al In addition the ectopic activity was associated with couplets tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation Departures from the classic criteria of parasystole could not be explained satisfactorily if a completely protected insulated pacemaker was assumed In each instance a triphasic response curve could be constructed suggesting that modulated parasystole was the mechanism common to both patients Couplets and runs of ventricular tachycardia were ascribed to single and repetitive reflection respectively in the presence of supernormal excitability of the ectopic pacemaker the ventricle or both In these patients fibrillation probably resulted from spatial nonuniformity of the ventricular response to the reflected event during a phase of vulnerability This study suggests that modulated parasystole in the presence of supernormal excitability may lead to very severe arrhythmias and trigger ventricular fibrillation In the clinical setting such patients may be misdiagnosed because of atypical features
S98	Twentynine fragments from herniated lumbar discs of patients over 60 years of age were studied pathohistologically For comparison 109 discs from patients under 59 years of age also were observed They were classified into seven types according to their composition In 70 of discs from patients between 60 and 69 and in 80 of discs from patients over 70 the fragments were composed of the anulus fibrosus and the cartilaginous endplate The authors concluded that the cartilaginous endplate had avulsed from the vertebral body and herniated with the anulus fibrosus in these cases This type of herniation occurs more often than herniation of the nucleus pulposus over 30 and may be most common in elderly patients because of their advanced disc degeneration
S99	A case of melanoma of the ciliary body is presented Initially the patient was diagnosed and treated for uveitis but following CT scanning and ultrasound a tumour was detected and the eye enucleated Histopathologically it was found that the tumour had invaded the optic nerve head apparently via Cloquets canal
S100	Although nasopharyngeal carcinoma is radiosensitive local failure after external radiotherapy is not uncommon and management of persistent or recurrent disease is a therapeutic challenge The present review reports the use of brachytherapy in the form of gold grain 198Au implants in the treatment of 23 patients with recurrent or persistent primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma The splitpalate approach was employed in the insertion of the gold grains This approach allows adequate exposure of the nasopharynx and accurate positioning of the implants Implantation was successful in 21 patients and local tumor control was achieved in 17 patients 81 after a median followup of 23 months Palatal fistula developed in 6 patients 26 5 healed with conservative management and 1 had no functional disturbance There was no operative mortality and morbidity of the operation was minimal
S101	Spinal injuries in patients with previous ankylosing spondylitis were reviewed retrospectively Fractures frequently occurred as a result of minimal trauma and were associated with severe neurologic deficits in 75 of cases A characteristic fracture pattern was seen radiographically and appeared to result from the altered biomechanics of the ankylosed spine Although the fractures were markedly unstable nonoperative treatment was uniformly successful in achieving union The incidence of complications and mortality in this group was significantly lower than that reported in other studies and the authors attribute this to conservative management within a spinal cord injury unit
S102	A hospitalbased casecontrol study of companion dogs examined the risk of developing canine malignant lymphoma associated with the use of chemicals in and about the home Information from a selfadministered owner questionnaire andor a telephone interview of about 491 cases 466 nontumor controls and 479 tumor controls indicated that owners in households with dogs that developed malignant lymphoma applied 24dichlorophenoxyacetic acid 24D herbicides to their lawn andor employed commercial lawn care companies to treat their yard significantly more frequently than control owners odds ratio  13 In addition the risk of canine malignant lymphoma rose to a twofold excess with four or more yearly owner applications of 24D The findings in this study are consistent with occupational studies in humans which have reported modest associations between agricultural exposure to 24D and increased risk of nonHodgkins lymphoma the histology and epidemiology of which are similar to those of canine malignant lymphoma The present study suggests that human health implications of 24D exposure in the home environment should receive further investigation
S103	The combined effects of proteinenergy malnutrition PEM and infection on thymic function evaluated by specific plasma thymulin activity were studied in Senegalese children 29 hospitalized in Dakar for severe malnutrition and various diseases 9 infected without sign of severe PEM living in Dakar 13 apparently healthy uninfected living in Dakar and 7 apparently healthy uninfected living in Paris Most of the freeliving children in Dakar suffered from mild to moderate PEM The specific thymulin activity total plasma activity minus the activity recorded after adsorption of the plasma with a monoclonal antithymulin antibody was almost undetectable in the infected children and was normal only in the children living in Paris Such activity might be decreased by moderate and severe PEM and severe malnutrition may not be the only underlying cause of depressed level of thymulin in malnourished children from the Third World Concurrent infections are important factors
S104	We have discussed several miscellaneous headache disorders not associated with structural brain disease The first group included those headaches provoked by exertional triggers in various forms These include benign cough headache BEH and headache associated with sexual activity The IHS diagnostic criteria were discussed Benign exertional headache and cough headache were discussed together because of their substantial similarities In general BEH is characterized by severe shortlived pain after coughing sneezing lifting a burden sexual activity or other similar brief effort Structural disease of the brain or skull was the most important differential diagnosis for these disorders with posterior fossa mass lesions being identified as the most common organic etiology Magnetic resonance imaging with special attention to the posterior fossa and foramen magnum is the preferred method for evaluating these patients Indomethacin is the treatment of choice The headache associated with sexual activity is dull in the early phases of sexual excitement and becomes intense at orgasm This headache is unpredictable in occurrence Like BEH the headache associated with sexual activity can be a manifestation of structural disease Subarachnoid hemorrhage must be excluded by CT scanning and CSF examination in patients with the sexual headache Benign headache associated with sexual activity has been successfully treated with indomethacin and betablockers The second miscellaneous group of headache disorders includes those provoked by eating something cold or food additives and by environmental stimuli Idiopathic stabbing headache does not have a known trigger and appears frequently in migraineurs Its occurrence may also herald the termination of an attack of cluster headache Indomethacin treatment provides significant relief Three headaches triggered by substances that are eaten were reviewed ingestion of a cold stimulus nitratenitriteinduced headache and MSGinduced headache For the most part avoidance of these stimuli can prevent the associated headache Lastly we reviewed headache provoked by high altitude and hypoxia The headache is part of the syndrome of AMS during its early or benign stage and the later malignant stage of HACE The pain can be exacerbated by exercise The best treatment is prevention via slow ascent and avoidance of respiratory depressants Acetazolamide and dexamethasone have proved useful in preventing this syndrome
S105	Many spontaneous mutations are caused by the insertion or excision of DNA elements Since most mutations are deleterious evolution should favor a mechanism for genetically controlling the rate of movement of transposable elements in most if not all organisms In Drosophila melanogaster a syndrome of correlated genetic changes including mutation chromosome breakage and sterility is observed in the hybrid progeny of crosses between different strains This syndrome which is termed hybrid dysgenesis results from the movement of PDNA elements What is not clear is whether the movement of other types of transposable elements is under the same coordinated control In this study the ability of hybrid dysgenesis to increase the rate of excision of 12 DNA elements at 16 mutant alleles and to induce insertionbearing mutations to change to other mutant states was tested The data show that hybrid dysgenesis caused by Pelement transpositions does not act as a general stimulus for the movement of other Drosophila transposable elements
S106	Hereditary pyropoikilocytosis HPP is a severe congenital hemolytic anemia occurring almost exclusively in black persons and characterized by extreme red blood cell anisopoikilocytosis The authors report two unrelated white females with HPP Both had severe hemolytic anemia at birth red blood cell morphologic features characteristic for HPP and increased thermal sensitivity of the red blood cells Examination of the red blood cell membranes of both patients showed markedly unstable membrane skeletons when subjected to shear stress spectrin dimer association defects with increased dimers and partial spectrin deficiency Limited tryptic digestion of the spectrin molecule from both patients yielded an abnormal pattern with a decrease in the normal 80000dalton alpha I domain and a concomitant increase of an abnormal 74000dalton peptide Sp alpha 174 One parent and one sibling of one of the patients with HPP had hereditary elliptocytosis HE and the Sp alpha 174 defect The other patient with HPP was different from others reported in that both parents were hematologically and biochemically normal In addition her daughter had HE and the Sp alpha 174 defect
S107	Radiationinduced meningiomas are becoming increasingly wellrecognized We report a case of a 35yearold man who developed a suprasellar meningioma 9 years after receiving a radiation dose of 4480 cGy for a pituitary adenoma The literature is also reviewed
S108	Ethnicity is important in assessing risk for osteoporotic fractures and should be considered in decisionmaking about the use of prophylactic treatments Few data are available however on fracture risks among Hispanic patients To assess the risk of vertebral fracture in Mexican Americans we determined the prevalence of vertebral fracture among 822 patients aged 15 to 86 years who underwent spinal roentgenography in a study of lowback pain After adjusting for age use of steroids drug or alcohol abuse and recent trauma the odds ratio for Mexican American women compared with nonHispanic whites was 055 95 confidence interval 032 to 095 indicating a substantially lower risk These results are concordant with earlier data documenting a reduced risk of hip fracture among Mexican American women Thus recommendations for prophylactic treatments for osteoporosis may be different for Mexican Americans than for nonHispanic whites
S109	An analysis of the outcome of first gamete intrafallopian transfers for 1071 women indicates that for those aged 40 years or more all the oocytes had to be transferred to obtain a 192 pregnancy rate In this agegroup pregnancy rate and multiple pregnancy rate were significantly lower than those for younger women Success rate but not multiple pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the group of women from whom 11 or more oocytes were recovered and transferred after ovulation induction than when only 14 oocytes were recovered and transferred The findings suggest that the number of oocytes transferred should depend on clinical circumstances
S110	Mean monthly values for ejaculate volume sperm density and percentage of motile sperm were calculated from semen analyses performed on volunteered donors to the laboratory from 1979 to 1986 The data of 4196 ejaculates were computerized by the single Cosinor method for searching on circannual rhythms of the parameters The study does not detect circannual rhythms neither of the ejaculate volume nor of the percentage of motile sperm A statistically significant highamplitude seasonal variation was detected in sperm court the highest values being recorded in late winter and early spring the lowest values being recorded in late summer
S111	The possibility of mumps was considered in 33 children with profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss of unknown origin Fifteen gave a history of mumps of whom 12 contracted the infection between the last normal and first abnormal hearing tests Hearing should be tested after mumps infection
S112	Extracellular ATP in its tetraanionic form ATP4 induces ion fluxes and membrane depolarization in the mouse macrophagelike cell line J7742 and in resident mouse macrophages We analyzed the effects of extracellular ATP4 by both patchclamp and intracellular microelectrode techniques Wholecell patchconfiguration membrane potential measurements on J7742 cells revealed that ATP4 induced depolarization occurred within 40 ms of pulsed application of ATP and was completely reversible The depolarizations were accompanied by a dramatic increase in membrane conductance and showed no sign of adaptation to ATP over a period of 30 min At 5 mM total ATP ATPt the wholecell conductance was approximately 10 nS and an upper limit of 20 pS for a singlechannel conductance has been established The reversal potential associated with the ATPinduced depolarization at asymmetric K Na Ca2 and Cl concentrations across the membrane was 0 mV In patchclamped cells depolarization was complete at 20 microM ATP4 and repolarization from full depolarization occurred in approximately 5 s In contrast in intact cells measured by microelectrode impalement complete depolarization occurred at approximately 2 mM ATP4 and repolarization was much slower approximately 100 min These findings indicate that the changes in intracellular ionic composition that occur after ATP treatment affect the rate of cell repolarization At lower concentrations of ATP potassium conductances modulated the depolarizing effect of ATP ATP also depolarized mouse peritoneal macrophages but a variant cell line ATPR B2 derived from J7742 cells by prolonged exposure to ATP was insensitive to ATP Our results provide a membrane electrophysiological description and analysis of a large nonselective plasma membrane conductance of macrophages induced by extracellular ATP
S113	Analysis by indirect immunoperoxidase staining of tissues demonstrated that monoclonal antibody mAb K27 derived from a mouse immunized with a renal cancer cell line OSRC2 was reactive with the tissues of all 36 normal kidneys examined including two fetal kidneys 22 of 25 renal cell carcinomas RCCs and one of 15 gastric cancers but not with 23 normal tissues from 11 different organs or 41 malignant tissues from 10 different organs mAb K27 was reactive with the kidneys of several animal species Positive staining was seen on tubular epithelial cells of the kidney Thus the antigen recognized by mAb K27 appeared to be an interspecies kidney specific antigen Results obtained by protein A PA assays with a cultured cell panel were consistent with those of staining and confirmed the restricted expression of the antigen Immunochemical analysis revealed that mAb K27 reacted with molecules of 63000 60000 and 43000 daltons
S114	We report a case of renal transplant ureteral obstruction caused by a cyclosporineassociated B cell lymphoproliferative disorder The interaction of cyclosporine with EpsteinBarr virus infections and the predisposition towards B cell lymphoproliferative disorders are reviewed The characterization of these tumors by deoxyribonucleic acid hybridization studies and a review of the clinical experience treating these disorders also are presented
S115	Somatostatin ST and vasopressin VP infusions were compared in the treatment of actively bleeding esophageal varices Fiftyfour patients with liver cirrhosis were included in the study Thirtytwo were given ST 42 microgramsmin and 22 patients were given VP 04 IUmin for 72 h after endoscopic diagnosis The role of alcoholic cirrhosis was similar in both groups Initial control of bleeding was achieved significantly more often p  00281 when ST was used 844 than during VP treatment 571 Rebleeding occurred in 188 and 48 respectively Side effects of treatment were significantly more common when VP was used than during ST treatment p  00021 Overall mortality was high in both groups being 34 in the ST group and 36 in the VP group ST infusion seems to be more effective and safer than VP in the treatment of acute variceal bleeding However the high frequency of rebleeding during ST treatment means that after primary hemostasis with ST infusion other methods such as surgery or sclerotherapy are needed to prevent the serious complications of rebleeding
S116	Studies relating to pathogenetic mechanisms resulting in impotence in diabetic subjects have been reviewed Erectile dysfunction was reported to occur in 50 to 75 percent of diabetic patients and the prevalence appeared to increase with age Contributions of vascular endocrine and neurologic system alterations result in this disturbing condition but a detailed analysis of all the parameters was not found in any individual study In our review of 301 veterans presenting to a sexual dysfunction clinic the clinical and hormonal alterations in the diabetic patients closely resemble those seen in nondiabetic impotent subjects Atherosclerotic vascular changes play an important predisposing role in the development of impotence A difference exists between the prevalences of associated medical conditions in diabetic patients taking insulin compared with those receiving oral agents or receiving dietary management The high prevalence of impotence in diabetic patients seems to be due to the high prevalence of its vascular complications Considering the availability of useful therapeutic approaches it is mandatory to evaluate all diabetic men for the presence of impotence
S117	The aim of this study was to investigate the hypothesis that during the postprandial period in humans dopamine interrupts the gastrointestinal motility pattern through a mechanism that is peptidemediated Fourteen normal human subjects were studied by means of intestinal manometry After recording two consecutive migrating motor complexes a 900kcal solidliquid meal was given In eight subjects 30 min after the meal placebo or dopamine 5 microgramskgmin was infused for 15 min and then the recording continued for 120 min In the remaining six subjects dopamine was administered twice with a 90min interval in between In three subjects the first dopamine infusion after the meal was preceded by treatment with placebo the second by domperidone 20 mg intravenous as bolus in the other three subjects domperidone was given before the first dopamine infusion Blood samples for the determination of somatostatin and motilin were drawn basally during and immediately after dopamine in seven subjects The results show that dopamine interrupts the fed motility pattern inhibiting the high antral waves and activates a duodenal phase III of migrating motor complexes The pretreatment with domperidone completely prevented the dopamine effect Plasma levels of motilin increased significantly during dopamine while somatostatin blood levels did not change These findings support the hypothesis that a dopaminergic mechanism may modulate the cycling of duodenal motor complex in humans
S118	Acute pyogenic meningitis occurred in a 46yearold woman receiving longterm steroid therapy Cultures for bacteria and fungi were negative and the meningitis failed to respond to broad spectrum antibiotics Abundant Strongyloides stercoralis larvae were found in the patients feces a sputum and a filariform larva was found in a hanging drop preparation from centrifuged cerebrospinal fluid Therapy with thiabendazole eradicated the Strongyloides from feces and sputum The abnormal CSF values returned toward normal and the patient has had no recurrence of illness
S119	We measured quality of care before and after implementation of the prospective payment system We developed a structured implicit review form and applied it to a sample of 1366 Medicare patients with congestive heart failure acute myocardial infarction pneumonia cerebrovascular accident or hip fracture who were hospitalized in 19811982 or 19851986 Very poor quality of care was associated with increased death rates 30 days after admission 17 with very good care died vs 30 with very poor care The quality of medical care improved between 19811982 and 19851986 from 25 receiving poor or very poor care to 12 although more patients were judged to have been discharged too soon and in unstable condition 7 vs 4 Except for discharge planning processes the quality of hospital care has continued to improve for Medicare patients despite or because of the introduction of the prospective payment system with its accompanying professional review organization review
S120	The oncoplacental protein SP1 is found in large quantities in human placenta amniotic fluid and pregnancy serum Low levels have been reported in association with malignancy but also in healthy nonpregnant individuals By indirect immunofluorescence fluorescenceactivated cell sorting and immunoprecipitation we here demonstrate the presence of SP1 both on the surface and in the cytoplasm of human granulocytes but not in earlier myeloid progenitor cells in bone marrow Lymphocytes did not contain the protein and only trace amounts could be found in the cytoplasm of blood monocytes A major glycoprotein with an apparent mol wt of 90000 was obtained by immunoprecipitation of surfacelabeled granulocytes Cultivated blood monocytes while adhering to surfaces or forming multinuclear giant cells displayed a strong membrane and cytoplasmic expression of SP1 Treatment of the myeloid leukemia cell line ML2 with tetraphorbol acetate TPA strongly induced SP1 in the membrane and cytoplasm as revealed by immunofluorescence and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PAGE of immunoprecipitates from lysates of surface radiolabeled cells The induction of synthesis of SP1 in TPAtreated cells was confirmed by immunoprecipitation from lysates of cells metabolically labeled with 35Smethionine Human lymphoblastoid and erythroleukemic cell lines did not express SP1 either before or after induced differentiation Thus SP1 provides a late differentiation marker for the myelomonocytic lineage and is strongly induced during macrophage differentiation or by TPA treatment of ML2 cells

S122	The effects of intrapartum vibratory acoustic stimulation during periods of decreased fetal heart rate variability were studied in 25 healthy term fetuses Fetal monitoring and realtime ultrasound scanning were used simultaneously to detect fetal response Vibratory acoustic stimulation was provided by an artificial larynx generating a signal at 85 dB and 85 Hz This stimulus was applied for 5 seconds on the maternal abdomen over the fetal head after a 20minute period of decreased fetal heart rate variability All fetuses reacted with an immediate fetal heart rate acceleration of at least 10 bpm range 10 to 35 bpm mean  SD  184  70 and 19 fetuses also had sudden fetal body movement A deceleration of the fetal heart rate after the initial acceleration was observed in nine fetuses range 15 to 70 bpm mean  SD  455  165 The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the possible use of fetal vibratory acoustic stimulation for intrapartum surveillance
S123	The purpose of this study was to determine whether race black v white and perceived stress were independent factors affecting the diurnal blood pressure variation of normal women The 110 women studied age  297  72 years range 20 to 50 were all employed in technical and clerical occupations from the same worksite They were divided into four groups based on race and how they perceived work stress on the day of study The results showed that there were no daytime differences in blood pressure levels in blacks or whites but women who perceived greater stress at work on the day of study had higher pressures during work 12378 v 11574 p less than 01 Blacks however had higher pressures during sleep than whites independent of the perception of work stress 10965 v 10460 P less than 01 These results suggest that the smaller drop in pressure during sleep in blacks is not related to perceived work stress but that the effects of perceived stress on daytime pressures is independent of race

S125	Recent studies have suggested that left ventricular LV dilatation during exercise radionuclide ventriculography may identify coronary artery disease CAD Coronary anatomy and LV enddiastolic pressure at catheterization were compared with results of supine exercise radionuclide ventriculography in 66 patients evaluated for chest pain Fortysix patients had significant CAD greater than 75 diameter stenosis and 20 patients were normal Radionuclide ventriculography was performed within 18 hours of catheterization at rest and at peak exercise Relative LV enddiastolic volumes were extrapolated from enddiastolic counts LV enddiastolic counts increased during exercise in 19 of 20 normal subjects In patients with CAD LV enddiastolic counts increased in 35 group A and decreased in 11 group B The percent change in LV enddiastolic counts from rest to exercise rest ejection fraction exercise ejection fraction and rest LV enddiastolic pressure for each group were 20  23 60  13 67  13 and 8  3 mm Hg in normal subjects 20  20 50  12 47  13 and 12  4 mm Hg in group A and 9  8 54  21 49  18 and 21  7 mm Hg in group B mean  standard deviation An increase in LV enddiastolic counts was unrelated to ejection fraction response or presence of underlying CAD but only correlated to rest LV enddiastolic pressure p less than 001ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S126	Twenty patients with benign anal strictures and five patients with mucosal ectropion were treated with island flap anoplasty Ushaped or diamondshaped islands of perianal skin were created without undermining and advanced into the anal canal to remedy the stricture or site of ectropion Over a postoperative followup period that averaged 19 months 16 patients judged their clinical results as excellent and 7 as good There were two failures In all patients the skin flaps survived even in the elderly patients Island flap anoplasty is a simple effective alternative to other forms of anoplasty such as YV advancement or Splasty
S127	It has been suggested that glycoproteins play an important role as a nucleating agent in the pathogenesis of gallstone formation Arachidonic acid by an indomethacinsensitive mechanism is known to enhance gallbladder mucus release suggesting that prostaglandins may regulate gallbladder epithelial release of mucus In this study the glycoprotein granules of the principal cells of the mouse gallbladder epithelium were morphometrically analyzed using electron microscopy It was shown that 5 micrograms of prostaglandin E2 injected into the gallbladder lumen of the anesthetized mouse reduced the relative volume of glycoprotein granules from 30 to 07 of the cytoplasmic volume within 20 min whereas injection of the same amount of the solvent for prostaglandin E2 had no such effect

S129	Seventy previously untreated patients with stage II III and IV intermediate or highgrade lymphoma were treated with methotrexate doxorubicin cyclophosphamide vincristine prednisone and bleomycin MACOPB between September 1985 and November 1987 Fortynine of these patients had diffuse largecell lymphoma DLCL and eight of these patients were human immunodeficiency virus HIVpositive Complete responses were achieved in 54 of all patients and 52 of those with DLCL With followup extending to 36 months 45 of all DLCL patients are alive and 50 are still living if the HIVpositive patients are excluded from the analysis Chemotherapy was quite toxic Seventyfive percent of patients had severe mucositis 42 had peripheral neuropathy 50 required hospitalization and 54 experienced leukopenia with a WBC count below 1000microL Seven percent five patients died of toxicity related to the chemotherapy Our analysis of prognostic parameters indicated that B symptoms a performance status below 80 and to a lesser extent elevation of serum lactic acid dehydrogenase LDH in HIVnegative DLCL patients were associated with an inferior survival Advanced age sex and bulky disease were not found to have a statistically significant effect on survival Our preliminary results indicate that MACOPB chemotherapy is an effective regimen for high and intermediategrade lymphomas However the survival for patients with DLCL treated with MACOPB is no different than that achieved with previous regimens at our institution
S130	Seventyfive patients with nonpenetrating chest injuries were evaluated with electrocardiography cardiac enzyme determination 2dimensional echocardiography and radionuclide ventriculography to document the incidence of cardiac abnormalities Although the electrocardiograms showed STT wave changes in 25 patients 33 sensitivity 47 and specificity 79 for echocardiographic and radionuclide abnormalities were poor Cardiac enzymes were abnormal in 10 patients 13 sensitivity for echocardiographic or radionuclide abnormalities or both was 29 and specificity 90 Wall motion abnormalities were detected in 11 patients 18 by radionuclide studies and in 3 patients 6 by echocardiography A pericardial effusion was present in 5 patients 10 Two patients 4 died of noncardiac causes neither had wall motion abnormalities This study documents the favorable outcome of patients with blunt chest injuries and does not suggest that echocardiography or radionuclide studies should be performed routinely on such patients
S131	Voltagedependent Ca2 channels VDCCs are modulators of synaptic plasticity oscillatory behavior and rhythmic firing in brain regions such as the hippocampus The distribution and lateral mobility of VDCCs on CA1 hippocampal neurons have been determined with biologically active fluorescent and biotinylated derivatives of the selective probe omegaconotoxin in conjunction with circular dityndallism digital fluorescence imaging and photobleach recovery microscopy On noninnervated cell bodies VDCCs were found to be organized in multiple clusters whereas after innervation the VDCCs were concentrated and immobilized at synaptic contact sites On dendrites VDCC distribution was punctate and was interrupted by extensive bare regions or abruptly terminated More than 85 of the dendritic VDCCs were found to be immobile by fluorescence photobleach recovery Thus before synaptic contact specific mechanisms target segregate and immobilize VDCCs to neuronal cell bodies and to specialized dendritic sites Regulation of this distribution may be critical in determining the firing activity and integrative properties of hippocampal CA1 neurons

S133	STUDY OBJECTIVE To confirm the antitumor efficacy of treatment with interleukin2 and lymphokineactivated killer cells in patients with metastatic renal cancer DESIGN Nonrandomized phase II clinical trial SETTING Tertiary care units in university medical centers PATIENTS Consecutive trial of 35 patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell cancer who have bidimensionally measurable disease performance status 0 or 1 and normal function of all vital organs Thirtytwo patients completed interleukin2 priming and received at least one lymphokineactivated killer cell infusion Three patients were removed from the study and did not receive infusion of cells secondary to rapid tumor progression or toxicity INTERVENTIONS Patients initially received recombinant interleukin2 100000 unitskg body weight every 8 hours on days 1 to 5 in a priming phase to stimulate lymphokineactivated killer cell precursors and effector activity in vivo Leukapheresis was done on days 8 to 12 and lymphocytes were cultured in vitro with interleukin2 for 3 to 4 days to amplify lymphokineactivated killer cell activity Finally interleukin2 100000 unitskg every 8 hours was infused with cultured cells on days 12 to 16 All doses of interleukin2 and lymphokineactivated killer cells were administered in intensive care units MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS The mean number of doses of interleukin2 administered during the priming phase was 129  04 the mean number of lymphokineactivated killer cells reinfused was 70  06 X 1010 and the mean number of interleukin2 doses administered during the last phase was 102  06 The overall objective response rate was 16 two patients had complete responses and three patients had partial responses with greater than 50 reduction of all measurable tumor The complete responders remain diseasefree at 12 and 9 months Two partial responders have not had tumor regrowth at 16 and 15 months The third partial responder relapsed at 4 months Toxicity was severe but generally of short duration and manageable There were no treatmentrelated deaths Hypotension weight gain anemia and elevations of serum creatinine levels and liver enzymes were common Two patients required intubation one patient had a myocardial infarction Conclusions This phase II study confirms the antitumor activity of interleukin2 and lymphokineactivated killer cell therapy in patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell cancer Response rates especially complete remission rates are comparable or better than rates achieved with other forms of therapy
S134	Thermal injury is a wellknown complication during mechanical manipulation of cortical bone In order to investigate the magnitude of the problem in relation to cancellous bone the temperature elevation in the head of the femur during reaming for a sliding screw osteosynthesis was measured in ten patients Temperatures in excess of 50 degrees for a duration of more than one minute were found within approximately 2 mm from the periphery of the reamer This finding implies that the thread of the screw will be placed in an osteonecrotic zone
S135	High frequency positive pressure ventilation has been suggested to result in a lower incidence of respiratory complications in preterm infants with idiopathic respiratory distress syndrome compared with ventilation at conventional rates A possible disadvantage is compromise of the infants cardiovascular condition secondary to inadvertent positive end expiratory pressure PEEP In a group of 20 such infants treated with high frequency positive pressure ventilation rates of up to 100minute and analysed changes in arterial blood pressure and cerebral blood flow velocity were largely influenced by changes in arterial blood gases and no effect could be attributed to inadvertent PEEP In addition the observed fall in both arterial carbon dioxide and oxygen tensions could be readily predicted for theoretical reasons Under certain conditions at the fastest rates used cerebral blood flow velocity was significantly influenced by changes in blood pressure which may indicate impaired cerebrovascular regulation Though other factors such as the severity of the infants illness or the use of paralysis may have been responsible for this apparent blood pressure passivity the role of high frequency positive pressure ventilation in such infants warrants further study
S136	Angiographic studies were performed on 60 of 394 patients diagnosed as having thoracic outlet syndrome Ten of the patients studied angiographically presented with obstruction of contrast material in the axilla with refilling of the axillary artery through the external mammary and shoulder arteries The obstruction was caused by lower trunk brachial plexus compression This seldom known cause of hyperabduction syndrome occurred in 25 per cent of the patients examined for thoracic outlet syndrome Surgical treatment consists of loosening the axillary artery by tying off the external mammary and circumflex arteries followed by section and anastomosis of the axillary artery anteriorly to the brachial plexus Angiography is considered a basic diagnostic procedure mainly when concomitant compression occurs and gives good dynamic information on the location and importance of the compression
S137	We prospectively studied the efficacy of influenza vaccine during an influenza AArizona80 H3N2 outbreak at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in New York in the winter season of 1982 to 1983 All patients had been offered influenza vaccine before the outbreak 181 chose to be vaccinated and 124 refused vaccination but agreed to participate in the study Among those with serologic evidence of influenza infection respiratory illness was significantly more common in the unvaccinated group six of 14 vs one of 22 The overall mortality was 13 72 of 181 in the vaccinated group and 22 177 of 124 in the control group The vaccinated and the control groups were examined for comparability A logistic regression analysis which controlled for differences in sex and level of nursing care indicated that the difference in mortality was still significant with a summary odds ratio of 27 The relative risk of death in the unvaccinated group was comparable at 218 Influenza vaccine reduced the mortality by 59 in the vaccinated group compared with the control group
S138	Transsphenoidal adenomectomy is the treatment of choice for patients with Cushings disease The combination of high serum and urinary cortisol and high plasma ACTH point to a nonadrenal source for Cushings syndrome It is important to rule out an ectopic source of ACTH production Imaging of the sella with MRI and CT and sampling petrosal sinus blood for ACTH measurement should allow differentiation between the two conditions For younger patients every effort should be made to preserve the normal gland If in the younger patient the adenoma cannot be clearly demonstrated it is appropriate to remove the central portion of the gland as advocated by Hardy Should hypercortisolism persist radiation therapy to the sella should be considered before attempting total hypophysectomy In the woman past childbearing age a total hypophysectomy can readily be considered if a sharply demarcated adenoma is not found In fact we counsel our older patients before operation that a total hypophysectomy is a possibility For the patient with an aggressive tumor that is not cured by pituitary operation radiation therapy must be considered If it is not possible to wait for the therapeutic effect of radiation adrenal suppression with aminoglutethimide metyrapone or ketoconazole is indicated Adrenalectomy may be considered
S139	Previous findings from this laboratory suggest a role for milkborne PRL in the development of the inhibitory neuroendocrine controls over PRL secretion Thus rats that consumed milk deficient in PRL on days 25 postpartum show reduced concentrations and turnover of DA in the median eminence and elevated serum levels of PRL at 3035 days of age The present experiments were undertaken to investigate whether these consequences of neonatal PRL deficiency persist beyond puberty and whether alterations in pituitary responsiveness to hypothalamic hormones may be involved Lactating rats received sc injections of either saline or the dopamine DA agonist bromocriptine 125 microgramsratday on each of days 25 postpartum a treatment that reduces the amount of PRL in milk without abolishing lactation Blood samples were obtained from male and female offspring at various postnatal ages and PRL concentrations were determined by RIA Serum PRL concentrations in offspring from both groups were low until after weaning but the female offspring of bromocriptinetreated mothers showed significantly elevated serum PRL between days 30 and 90 postpartum Male offspring of bromocriptinetreated mothers also had transiently increased serum PRL levels which returned to control levels by day 40 The turnover rate of DA in the median eminence calculated from the rate of decline after synthesis inhibition was reduced on day 35 in neonatally PRLdeficient offspring as shown previously However no differences in DA turnover between the two groups were apparent on day 60 indicating a recovery of normal dopaminergic activity Anterior pituitary cells of 100dayold control and neonatally PRLdeficient animals were dispersed cultured for 3 days and then exposed to either TRH to stimulate PRL release or to the DA agonist bromocriptine which inhibits PRL release Pituitary cells of neonatally PRLdeficient offspring were almost completely unresponsive to bromocriptine with regard to suppression of PRL release and cytoplasmic PRL mRNA levels In contrast pituitary cells of neonatal PRLdeficient offspring were somewhat more responsive to TRH in stimulating PRL release and increasing the levels of PRL mRNA These results suggest that a brief period of PRL deficiency during the neonatal period may result in longlasting alterations in control of PRL secretion The resultant hyperprolactinemia may be initiated by a reduction in the release of DA from the hyothalamus perhaps reflecting a role for milkderived PRL in the functional development of this neurosecretory system and maintained in part by a reduction in pituitary responsiveness to DA
S140	Effects of prostaglandin PG I2 and thromboxane Tx A2 on the systemic blood pressure the internal diameter of arterioles with a diameter of 20 to 30 microns and the change caused by the topical administration of norepinephrine NE were studied in the rat mesentery The change in diameter was measured by an imageshearing eyepiece and television microscopy The rats were divided into three groups Group I 9 rats served as the nontreated control group In group II 6 rats PGI2 was given at the rate of 06 microgramskgmin for ten minutes In group III 6 rats E341imidazolylmethylphenyl2propenoic acid hydrochloride monohydrate OKY 046 which is a highly selective TxA2 synthetase inhibitor was administered at the rate of 05 mgkgmin for ten minutes The hypotension caused by PGI2 administration was accompanied by arteriolar constriction although it disappeared with the increase in the systemic blood pressure five minutes after administration of PGI2 was stopped The systemic blood pressure and the internal diameter of arterioles showed no change in the OKY 046 and in the control group The vasoconstrictive response to NE was inhibited by PGI2 and OKY 046 for thirty to fortyfive minutes and the inhibitory effects were similar in both cases These results show that PGI2 and a selective Tx synthetase inhibitor OKY 046 attenuate the vascular response to NE
S141	We present a 30yearold man with pulmonary hypertension after pulmonary embolism Pulmonary angiography showed multiple stenoses in the pulmonary vascular tree We treated four of these stenoses by balloon angioplasty in three sessions Pulmonary artery pressure was reduced from 9025 mm Hg mean 46 to 7813 mm Hg mean 35 with concomitant increase of aortic pressure from 10560 mm Hg mean 75 to 13468 mm Hg mean 90 Pulmonary perfusion scintigraphy showed increase of perfusion in the treated segments Two procedures were followed by transient segmental pulmonary edema but no other complications were noted We conclude that balloon angioplasty is a promising method of lowering pulmonary artery pressure and improving pulmonary perfusion in suitable cases of pulmonary hypertension secondary to pulmonary embolism
S142	The American Dietetic Association supports the concept of optimal weight that considers a variety of factors to determine the most favorable weight for the individual Adequate research exists to support the following The prevention of obesity in children and adults through nutrition and health education should be a primary objective for registered dietitians and other health care professionals Optimal weight for individuals should be determined by considering health risks heredity age sex percentage body fat and realistic goalsetting Children should not be placed on restrictedcalorie diets rather efforts should be made to encourage the child to be physically active to eat a wellbalanced diet and to return to internal control of eating Also normalization of the feeding relationship between parent and child is important Weight control programs should include behavioral management techniques for food intake exercise stress and improved selfesteem The programs should focus on loss of body fat and avoidance of repeated diet failures Healthful behaviors that can prevent and reduce the incidence of obesity should be encouraged by registered dietitians and other health care providers educators the food industry insurance companies employers school programs and families The concept of optimal weight may be modified as scientific evidence is accumulated on the determinants of body composition and weight effective nutrition and health education approaches and effective weight management strategies Research is needed to permit development of more effective weight management strategies and programs for the overweight population
S143	Optimal treatment planning of target volume that surrounds a vital critical structure is often very difficult Treatment techniques using moving beam therapy with fields asymmetric with respect to rotational axis of the collimator head allow treatment of such target volumes with minimal dose to critical structures The availability of independent motion of the collimator jaws on new medical accelerators allows easy setting up of asymmetric treatment portals Therefore treatment techniques utilizing asymmetric field arc rotations with acceptable dose distributions have been possible
S144	Data on 111 lesions in addition to pulmonary valve aortic valve branch pulmonary stenosis native coarctation and recoarctation were submitted to the Valvuloplasty and Angioplasty of Congenital Anomalies Registry Because there was a very heterogenous group of lesions both in types of lesions and techniques of dilation only minimal data can be offered concerning the efficacy of the dilation of any or all of these lesions The registry data do however demonstrate the safety of these dilations compared to alternative surgical therapy
S145	The frequency and type of psychiatric disease were investigated in 40 patients suffering from systemic lupus erythematosus SLE and 27 control subjects with rheumatoid arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease The psychiatric morbidity at the time of interview was the same in the two groups but the patients with SLE had experienced more episodes of psychiatric illness in the past and psychotic symptoms occurred only in this group Half of the patients with SLE had previous or current evidence of neurological involvement an association was found between neurological disease and psychotic symptoms in SLE while anxiety and affective disturbances appeared to be closely related to environmental factors in both patients with SLE and controls There was no correlation between psychiatric and neurological disease and clinical or laboratory indices of disease activity Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was performed in 15 patients with SLE Abnormalities were more often present in those with neurological disease no such correlation was found with psychiatric illness
S146	We studied subarachnoid hemorrhage in the population of Rochester Minnesota for the 40year period from 1945 through 1984 The average annual incidence rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage in Rochester has remained constant at approximately 11 per 100000 population Agespecific incidence rates increased with age However the average annual mortality rate for subarachnoid hemorrhage in Rochester has shown a decreasing trend from 68 per 100000 population in 19551964 to 43 in 19751984 It is likely that this is due to a decrease in casefatality rates from 57 in 19451974 to 42 in 19751984 p  010 This decreasing trend was also evident in annual mortality rates from subarachnoid hemorrhage for US white men and women The reason for the improved casefatality rate is unclear but it may be related to changes in management The interval from onset of subarachnoid hemorrhage to surgery decreased from a median of 12 days in 19751979 to 2 days in 19801984 and of those who survived to receive medical attention more patients received some form of medical treatment in 19801984 Whether either or both of these changes have led to the decrease in the casefatality rate is uncertain
S147	Hypothermia a relatively common problem in the winter months can cause significant morbidity It presents in a variety of situations and affects a wide age range Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion because the symptoms which are primarily related to the central nervous system are not distinctive Appropriate management requires accurate measurement of core body temperature Treatment is centered on rewarming the patient safely and efficiently while providing other supportive measures Care should be taken to avoid arrhythmias Simple precautions greatly reduce the risk of hypothermia
S148	Some reports in the medical literature have mentioned the occurrence of psychotic reactions in response to the use of certain ergot alkaloids in therapeutic doses Prompted by these observations we undertook a search for cases of pure puerperal psychosis ie typical manifestations 314 days postpartum in order to evaluate the clinical background of this phenomenon Special attention was paid to the medications that the patients had received peripartum In the last 10 years out of eight perinatal centers we found only three cases that fulfilled the criteria of the quoted entity In all instances the manifestations of puerperal psychosis had been preceded by the administration of ergot derivatives Based on the presented data we hypothesize that typical postpartum psychosis may represent an idiosyncratic reaction to potent vasoactive drugs including ergot derivatives The similarities between the clinical manifestations of ergotism and puerperal psychosis and some of the epidemiologic features of the latter condition appear to implicate ergot alkaloids as potential causative agents Although the validity of the suggested interpretation requires further evaluation we believe that the currently available data warrant caution with regard to the administration of ergot derivatives postpartum These drugs should not be used in the absence of clear indication or in unnecessarily high doses We suggest that ergotism be included in the differential diagnosis in cases of pure puerperal psychosis
S149	Malassezia pachydermatis a yeast that has not previously been implicated as a cause of human disease was isolated from cultures of blood from three infants All infants were 2527 w of gestational age and had multiple underlying medical problems The infants had been hospitalized for at least six weeks had received broadspectrum antibiotics and had received parenteral lipid nutrition via a central venous catheter In one patient fungemia was accompanied by clinical and laboratory evidence of Broviac catheter infection During a threeyear period M pachydermatis was also recovered from fungal cultures of an additional 30 patients 85 of whom were infants A pathogenic role for M pachydermatis recovered from sources other than blood or catheters was not established Risk factors for and symptoms in infants with M pachydermatis fungemia appeared to be similar to those described for Malassezia furfur sepsis
S150	The effect of trimethaphan Arfonad infusion on platelet function was prospectively evaluated in 38 n  38 patients 28 patients receiving trimethaphan ten control patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery Any patient with a positive history for the ingestion of medication known to interfere with platelet function was excluded from the study Following induction of anesthesia with fentanyl and prior to cardiopulmonary bypass 28 patients n  28 received trimethaphan as clinically indicated to maintain a mean blood pressure of 80 mmHg The infusion rate and total dose of trimethaphan delivered was recorded for each patient The evaluation of platelet function was performed via adenosine diphosphate ADP and epinephrineinduced platelet aggregation tests The administration of trimethaphan failed to result in any detrimental effect on platelet function as assessed via these aggregation studies Template bleeding times were also performed on all study patients Bleeding time measurements performed in patients following trimethaphan administration were unchanged from baseline values Platelet aggregation studies and bleeding time performed in control group following the administration of fentanyl 30 microgramskg plus enflurane inspired concentration 051 did not reveal any deviation from baseline values These results are in contrast to a previous study that demonstrated a negative effect upon platelet function following sodium nitroprusside administration at clinically acceptable doses These data demonstrate that trimethaphan provides control of arterial pressure with preservation of platelet function
S151	The IgG and IgM specific antibodies against a panel of 23 anaerobic gut bacteria were examined in Crohns disease ulcerative colitis and healthy controls Four of the organisms Bifidobacterium bifidum Coprococcus comes ME46 Coprococcus comes Sp4 and Eubacterium limosum gave abnormal antibody titres in Crohns disease compared with those of controls In Crohns disease specific IgG antibodies to three of the organisms were low and the IgM antibodies were higher than those of controls IgM antibodies were also raised in ulcerative colitis Antigenic cross reactivity could be shown between some of these organisms The possible clinical importance of these abnormal antibody responses to specific organisms is unexplained
S152	Selfcare is an important issue in the management of adults with asthma Little is known about the specific strategies used by people with asthma to control symptoms and abort asthma attacks The purpose of this study was to identify selfcare strategies used to control asthma symptoms and to determine the effect of peak expiratory flow rate PEFR information on selection of selfcare strategies Thirty adult subjects with asthma were randomly assigned to either a control or an experimental group 28 completed the study All subjects recorded episodes of dyspnea wheezing and chest tightness and selfcare actions in an asthma symptom diary The experimental group recorded PEFR at the beginning and end of each symptom episode Reported strategies were categorized into problemfocused emotionfocused or mixed selfcare strategies The experimental group with access to PEFR information used medication significantly less often than the control group The experimental group also reported fewer and less frequent uses of alternative nondrug strategies
S153	Hereditary coproporphyria can cause both peripheral neuropathy and central nervous system abnormalities There are several similarities between multiple sclerosis and hereditary coproporphyria that are probably due to the central nervous system dysfunction present in both This report describes a 62yearold man with a fiveyear history of progressive paraparesis initially diagnosed as multiple sclerosis Supporting evidence for the diagnosis of a demyelinating disease included three oligoclonal bands in the patients cerebral spinal fluid a prolonged visual evoked response bilaterally abnormal sensory evoked potentials and an area of increased signal in the posterior cervical cord suggestive of demyelination that was demonstrated on magnetic resonance imaging MRI Features atypical for multiple sclerosis were hypoactive deeptendon reflexes electromyographic evidence of peripheral neuropathy and severe constipation Elevated urine porphyrins and decreased levels of coproporphyrinogen oxidase confirmed the correct diagnosis of hereditary coproporphyria The patient improved after being placed on a highcarbohydrate diet Although central demyelination is known to occur in patients with porphyria delayed evoked potentials and MRI abnormalities have not been previously reported
S154	The largest and most important group that may be reached by health education is found in the school system Children not only are fast learners and anxious to acquire new skills but also are at risk for the development of dental health problems Therefore regardless of the equivocal nature of the evidence regarding the effectiveness of school dental health educational programs it is important that they continue to be developed The programs created should have objectives pretesting participatory and cognitive experiences periodic review of dental health program by an advisory committee a liaison between school personnel and health professionals and realistic models to assess the effects of the program on health Because dental disease preventive programs and regimens such as water fluoridation topical fluorides dental sealants and oral hygiene regimens are available that have the potential to eliminate dental disease effort should be made to increase the awareness of the children who can benefit from them
S155	A case of metastasizing invasive carcinoma of breast to an expanding extradural frontal meningioma is presented The peculiar tendency of meningioma to be the host tumor for carcinoma is discussed The literature pertaining to such rare occurrences is reviewed
S156	Involvement of the upper gastrointestinal tract by Crohns disease is being recognized with increasing frequency Gastroduodenal disease is more common although esophageal disease is now noted infrequently as well There is nearly always concomitant involvement of the small bowel or colon Initial phases of the disease are manifested as superficial inflammatory changes of the mucosa but can progress to scarring and stenosis Optimum doublecontrast technique is necessary to detect these early lesions
S157	Volunteers consumed a mixedfat diet for 6 d Preexp and then either a canolaoilbased diet CAN containing linolenic acid 183n3 or a sunfloweroilbased diet SUN rich in linoleic acid 182n6 for 18 d followed by the alternative diet in a crossover design Platelet phospholipids were analyzed for changes in fatty acid composition Eicosapentaenoic acid EPA 205n3 was significantly higher in alkenylacyl ethanolamine phosphoglyceride PPE and in total phosphatidylcholine PC after CAN compared with SUN and Preexp The 225n3 was increased in PPE after CAN above concentrations found after both SUN and Preexp Lower concentrations of 204n6 and 224n6 were observed with CAN in PC and lower concentrations of 224n6 in PPE These results indicate that the consumption of canola oil moderately increases EPA concentrations and alters the concentrations of other n6 and n3 fatty acids in human platelet phospholipids
S158	High extracellular Ca2 stimulates the accumulation of inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol in parathyroid cells and suppresses PTH release Since diacylglycerol is an endogenous activator of protein kinaseC these observations would suggest that activation of protein kinaseC is associated with inhibition of PTH release However phorbol esters which stimulate protein kinaseC activity have been reported to enhance PTH release To clarify the role of protein kinaseC in the regulation of PTH secretion we studied the responses of parathyroid cells to phorbol myristate acetate PMA bryostatin1 and 12dioctanoylglycerol diC8 PMA and bryostatin1 translocated protein kinaseC activity from the soluble to particulate fractions of cell homogenates Phosphotransferase activity in the particulate fractions increased from 21  4 to 93  6 of the total activity after 10 min of exposure to PMA 106 M and from 21  2 to 69  2 after 5 min of exposure to bryostatin1 107 M These three structurally different agonists of protein kinaseC also altered the typical secretory response to Ca2 in parathyroid cells At 20 mM extracellular Ca2 PMA 106 M bryostatin1 107 M and 12dioctanoylglycerol 3 x 104 M blunted the suppressive effects of high Ca2 on secretion thus stimulating PTH release 252  45 122  20 and 485  95 over control levels respectively However at low extracellular Ca2 these agents inhibited maximal PTH release Since changes in the intracellular free Ca2 concentration Ca2i may be important in the control of PTH release we investigated whether protein kinaseC agonists changed the relationship between extracellular Ca2 and PTH release by affecting Ca2i In PMAtreated cells the intracellular Ca2 response to raising extracellular Ca2 from 05 to 15 and 20 mM was reduced to 50  1 and 63  3 of that in control cells respectively P less than 0005 n  711 Specifically PMA preincubation reduced the initial intracellular Ca2 transient with raising extracellular Ca2 from 05 to 20 mM and with adding 40 mM Sr2 The sustained phase response to high Ca2 but not to Sr2 was also attenuated after incubation with PMA We conclude that protein kinaseC agonists suppress PTH release at low extracellular Ca2 and enhance PTH release at high extracellular Ca2 The effects on secretion at high extracellular Ca2 may be related to the ability of protein kinaseC agonists to change the sensitivity of Ca2i to high extracellular Ca2 in these cells
S159	A common complication of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS is being increasingly recognized Known as AIDS dementia complex the disorder is characterized by global impairment of intellectual and cognitive functions personality and behavioral disturbances and motor dysfunction manifested by impaired speech gait and coordination AIDS dementia complex progresses rapidly and inexorably from psychomotor slowing to dementia then to an akinetic mute state in which the patient becomes immobile and incapable of speaking and finally to coma Differentiation of AIDS dementia complex from a potentially treatable condition such as reactive depression is important Zidovudine Retrovir the drug currently used to treat AIDS has shown promise in the treatment of AIDS dementia complex Clinical trials are now under way to determine its efficacy in this application
S160	The effect of the posterior stabilizing mechanism on rotational stability in total knee arthroplasty TKA was investigated in six cadaver knees using a special kneetesting device The device evaluated varusvalgus rotational and anteroposterior AP stability in the normal knee compared to a posterior stabilized TKA with either a rotationally constrained or an unconstrained articular surface None of the stability parameters was significantly different from normal in either configuration of the tibial surface but the constrained surface did decrease rotational deflection compared to the rotationally unconstrained surfaces These findings show that rotational constraint in a posterior stabilized TKA is not necessary to achieve rotational stability as long as varusvalgus stability is achieved by appropriately tensioning the collateral ligaments
S161	A semisynthetic RNase RNase1118111124 consisting of a noncovalent complex between residues 1118 of RNase obtained from the proteolytic digestion of RNase A and a synthetic 14residue peptide containing residues 111124 of RNase exhibits 98 of the enzymatic activity of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease A EC 31275 The replacement of aspartic acid121 by asparagine in this semisynthetic RNase to form the D121N analog reduces kcatKm to 27 of the value for RNase A In the present work 1H NMR spectroscopy has been used to probe the ionization states of His12 His105 and His119 in this catalytically defective semisynthetic RNase A comparison of the observed resonances of D121N with those previously determined by others for RNase A enabled us to assign the C2 proton NMR resonances to individual residues the assignment of His119 was confirmed by titrating D121N with the fully deuterated peptide Asn121RNase111124 The observed pKa values of His12 His105 and His119 decrease 018 016 and 002 pH unit respectively as a result of the D121N replacement Values calculated by using a finite difference algorithm to solve the PoissonBoltzmann equation the DELPHI program version 30 and a refined 20A coordinate set for the crystal structure of D121N differ significantly for active site residues His12 delta pKa  058 and His119 delta pKa  055 but not for His105 delta pKa  010 The elmination of bound water from the calculations reduced but did not reconcile these discrepancies His12 delta pKa  036 His119 delta pKa  041
S162	We describe a technique of surgically removing melanomas that involve the ciliary body andor the choroid while leaving intact the outer portion of the sclera and the overlying sensory retina This procedure called a partial lamellar sclerouvectomy can be subclassified as a partial lamellar sclerocyclochoroidectomy in the case of ciliochoroidal melanomas and as a partial lamellar sclerochoroidectomy in the case of pure choroidal melanomas
S163	The neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid GABA is involved in the regulation of secretion of MSH from the intermediate lobe of Xenopus laevis The purpose of this study was to identify the GABA receptors involved by determination of the effect of specific receptor agonists and antagonists on the release of immunoreactive MSH from superfused neurointermediate lobes of Xenopus Exogenous GABA induces a rapid inhibition of MSH secretion There was no evidence for a transitory stimulatory effect of GABA as reported for the rat melanotropes Both the GABA agonists GABAa homotaurine and isoguvacine and the GABA agonist GABAb baclofen inhibited MSH release in a dosedependent manner In vivo homotaurine and baclofen caused aggregation of pigment in dermal melanophores The MSH releaseinhibiting effect of homotaurine and isoguvacine could be antagonized by the specific GABAa receptor antagonist bicuculline However bicuculline and picrotoxin failed to block the effect of exogenous GABA We conclude that in the neurointermediate lobe of Xenopus laevis both GABAa and GABAb receptors are present suggesting a dual inhibitory regulation
S164	Proximate composition minerals fatty acids and sterols were determined for eight species of shellfish commonly marketed in the Northwest Moisture and total lipid content varied with the size of the species with more variation in mollusca than in crustacea total lipid content ranged from 07 in sea scallops to 31 in blue mussels but only from 12 in Dungeness crab to 13 in pink shrimp The mineral content was highly variable the mineral content of Northwest samples tended to be lower than that reported in other studies Generally shellfish are good sources of zinc and Pacific oysters blue mussels and Manila clams are also good sources of iron Five fatty acids 160 161 181 205n3 and 226n3 represented from 60 to 84 of the fatty acid content Palmitic acid ranged from 13 to 32 of the total fatty acids Longchain n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids were predominant 376 to 543 with sea scallops containing more than 50 n6 polyunsaturated fatty acids ranged from 15 to 65 In crustacea cholesterol was the primary sterol and brassicasterol was the only other measurable sterol In all mollusca except California squid cholesterol averaged 37 mg100 gm and ranged from 23 to 39 of the total sterols In squid cholesterol at 231 mg100 gm was the only measurable sterol We conclude that shellfish vary widely in their nutrient content but in general are valuable additions to the diet
S165	In 52 women in late pregnancy the mean durations of transient fetal tachycardia after vibroacoustic stimulation during low fetal heart rate variability 48 minutes and high fetal heart rate variability 63 minutes were similar The fetal heart rate continued with high variability in all cases suggesting that the fetus did not return to its prestimulation state after vibroacoustic stimulation during quiescence In 10 women the duration of high variability after vibroacoustic stimulation during low fetal heart rate variability was significantly shorter mean 22 minutes than the preceding mean 36 minutes or subsequent mean 43 minutes highvariability components of complete rest activity cycles In another 10 women the duration of high variability after vibroacoustic stimulation during high fetal heart rate variability was similar to preceding and subsequent highvariability episodes In these 20 women the next complete restactivity cycle after vibroacoustic stimulation was not different in duration to the complete cycle recorded on the previous day

S167	With the refinement of fineneedle aspiration the specific applications of thyroid imaging techniques need to be reevaluated for efficiency and cost containment No thyroid imaging test should be routinely obtained Radionuclide scanning is most beneficial in evaluating the functional status of thyroid nodules when fineneedle aspiration is inadequate the findings are benign or when there is no discrete nodule that is palpated in an enlarged gland When fineneedle aspiration is unavailable or unreliable radionuclide scanning becomes a firstline diagnostic tool Ultrasonography should be used primarily for identifying a solid component of a cystic nodule determining the size of nodules on thyroxine suppression that are not easily palpable or for performing guided fineneedle aspiration Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging both have a definite role in the evaluation of thyroid tumors Magnetic resonance imaging is superior to computerized tomography for the evaluation of metastatic retrotracheal or mediastinal involvement of large thyroid tumors or goiters Careful selection of the diagnostic techniques will ensure more accurate diagnosis and reduce unnecessary patient costs in the treatment of thyroid cancer
S168	A muscle biopsy from a patient with hypothyroid myopathy showed striking central changes Cores were seen in most type 1 fibers with oxidative enzyme preparations Electron microscopy of these areas revealed Z disc streaming myofilament disruption and absent mitochondria The myopathy rapidly improved with thyroxine treatment This biopsy is of interest as numerous cores have not previously been reported in hypothyroid myopathy
S169	CTL clones isolated from PBL or from tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes TIL of a melanoma patient pt665 were screened for specificity on a panel including autologous tumor cells from two distinct metastases Me6651 Me6652 autologous EBVtransformed B cells and 15 allogeneic cell lines of different histology Each clone displayed a peculiar cytolytic activity ranging from lysis of most targets PBL clone 4C4 to preferential reactivity on the two autologous metastases TIL clone 8B3 Blocking and modulation experiments revealed that the lysis of autologousTu cells by TIL clone 8B3 but not by PBL clone 4C4 could be inhibited by mAb to HLAclass I and to CD3 Ag or by CD3 complex modulation Clone 8B3 was tested also on a panel of 25 tumor clones from Me6652 revealing that only 4 neoplastic clones were lysed 24 214 217 and 251 Cold target competition experiments indicated that the uncloned autologous melanomas and one tumor clone 217 but no two other tumor clones 210 215 could compete with one another for lysis by 8B3 Determination of melanin content of tumor clones from Me6652 revealed that the four neoplastic clones recognized by 8B3 possessed much lower melanin levels than all the other 20 clones not lysed by this effector
S170	Federal recognition of the tribal status of the Klamath Indians of Oregon was terminated by Congress in 1954 along with all health education and welfare services In the winter and spring of 1985 a health status and health care needs assessment was conducted among 202 Klamath Indians ages 40 years and older with the use of a shortened version of the Older Americans Resources and Services OARS instrument Twenty percent of the Klamaths surveyed reported having diabetes and more than 30 percent reported having arthritis rheumatism or hypertension or having had their gallbladder removed The data were compared with those of national surveys of Indian and nonIndian elders that also used the OARS instrument Even though the Klamaths surveyed were younger than the comparison groups their health status was no better than that of other Indians and was worse than that of the nonIndian population Moreover among these Klamath adults health insurance coverage was lower and perceived unmet needs for medical care were higher than in either of the comparison groups
S171	Acute pancreatitis is often associated with impaired cardiovascular function This study examined the systemic cardiovascular effect of acute pancreatitis induced by injection of autologous bile 05 mlkg into the canine pancreatic duct After acute pancreatitis was induced eight dogs were given no resuscitation group 1 untreated pancreatitis and lactated Ringers solution was infused in 11 dogs group II treated pancreatitis to maintain mean arterial pressure and pulmonary wedge pressure at control values In the untreated pancreatitis group mean arterial pressure cardiac output stroke volume and stroke work values decreased mean arterial pressure from 101  4 to 74  12 mm Hg cardiac output from 118  7 to 562  11 mlminkg stroke volume from 093  008 to 022  007 mlbeatkg p less than 005 whereas heart rate and peripheral resistance increased heart rate from 125  7 to 185  10 beatsmin peripheral vascular resistance from 3130  410 to 4436  610 dynesseccm5 p less than 005 Although coronary blood flow endocardialepicardial flow ratio and myocardial oxygen delivery values decreased progressively in group I after induction of pancreatitis these changes did not achieve statistical significance All indices of cardiovascular function and coronary blood flow remained unchanged in group II Neither dPdt max the maximal rate of left ventricular pressure increase nor dPdt at a developed pressure of 40 mm Hg an index of myocardial contractility minimally affected by changes in preload and afterload were depressed by bileinduced acute canine pancreatitis in either group Our data indicate that the detrimental effects of acute pancreatitis on cardiovascular function are related solely to hypovolemia and reduced cardiac filling and not to humoral or reflex effects induced by the disease
S172	To verify the hypothesis that alveolar macrophages AMs from patients infected with HIV1 could synthesize and release TNF alpha AMs recovered from the BAL fluid of 11 patients with seropositive HIV1 six with AIDS and five with ARC were tested in vitro for their ability to destroy TNF alphasusceptible targets Furthermore the presence of TNF alpha was assessed in AMconditioned supernatants on the basis of their cytotoxic activity and by using an immunoenzymatic test and immunoblotting Transcription of the TNF alpha gene in AMs was also studied by means of the Northern blot analysis AMs freshly recovered from patients infected with HIV1 exhibited high levels of cellmediated cytotoxicity against U937 targets and the addition of a polyclonal antiTNF alpha antibody resulted in a significant inhibition of the target lysis Cellfree supernatants conditioned by unstimulated AMs exerted high levels of cytotoxic activity against TNF alphasensitive targets whereas duplicate neutralization experiments performed in the presence of an antiTNF alpha antibody proved that the observed cytotoxic activity was mostly mediated by TNF alpha The presence of high amounts of TNF alpha in the conditioned media was confirmed by the immunoenzymatic test In addition the immunoblot analysis showed that the TNF alpha released by AMs has a Mr 17000 band identical to a standard preparation of recombinant TNF alpha The Northern blot demonstrated that unstimulated AMs express detectable levels of mRNA transcripts for TNF alpha Taken together our data support the concept that AMs from patients with HIV1 infection constitutively release TNF alphaABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S173	Three different micromanipulation procedures were used to assist human fertilization in cases of severe male factor infertility Zona drilling was performed either with acid Tyrodes solution mechanically following zona softening with chymotrypsin or by partial zona dissection The fertilization rate was lowest in the zona drillingacid Tyrodes group 740 175 although no differences between groups zona drillingchymotrypsin 2184 25 partial zona dissection 31143 217 were significant The fertilization rate was significantly increased relative to untreated eggs from the same patients only in the partial zona dissection group 31143 217 versus 4102 39 Oocyte damage occurred at a high rate as a result of zona drilling with acid Tyrodes solution 1341 37 Embryonic development was compromised after zona drilling with chymotrypsin only 712 583 of the fertilized oocytes cleaved and the morphology of many of the cleaved embryos was abnormal Although only 61 1626 of the diploid embryos resulting from partial zona dissection cleaved the embryonic morphology of these embryos was comparable with controls No pregnancies resulted from the transfer of manipulated embryos We conclude that although zona manipulation increases the fertilization rate losses due to oocyte trauma low rates of diploid fertilization low rates of cleavage and a high frequency of abnormal cleavage reduce the number of embryos available for transfer
S174	Programs for data analysis available on microcomputers now rival those programs available for mainframes in terms of ease of use accuracy accessibility and cost Researchers should seriously consider the possibilities that exist for data analysis on both the microcomputer and the mainframe An informed decision will allow best use of available resources
S175	The product of the cabl protooncogene cAbl is phosphorylated on three sites during interphase and seven additional sites during mitosis Two interphase and all mitotic cAbl sites are phosphorylated by cdc2 kinase isolated from either interphase or mitotic cells with the mitotic cdc2 having an 11fold higher activity Inhibition of phosphatases with okadaic acid in interphase cells leads to the phosphorylation of cAbl mitotic sites indicating that those sites are preferentially dephosphorylated during interphase The differential phosphorylation of cAbl in the cell cycle is therefore determined by an equilibrium between cdc2 kinase and protein phosphatase activities Treatment of interphase cells with okadaic acid leads to a rounded morphology similar to that observed during mitosis
S176	A prospective controlled trial to reduce polypharmacy in patients 65 years or older was carried out in the residents clinic of a teaching hospital Of 272 elderly patients surveyed 89 33 were taking five or more prescription drugs Recommendations to discontinue medications or to simplify regimens were formulated for 79 polypharmacy patients Compared to 41 controls the 38 patients whose physicians were informed of the recommended changes demonstrated a small but significant reduction in the mean number of drugs the complexity and the cost of their regimens Physicians complied with eight 100 of eight recommendations to simplify a dosage schedule eight 62 of 13 recommendations to substitute a new drug for the old one and only eight 40 of 20 recommendations to stop a medication P  04 Noncompliance usually resulted from patient refusal or from medications being prescribed by another provider Whereas feedback to the primary physician is beneficial more substantial reductions in outpatient polypharmacy may require overcoming patient barriers and limiting the number of prescribing physicians
S177	The majority of patients treated for chronic renal failure die from cardiovascular complications Lipid abnormalities in this group are thought to contribute to this high mortality The authors have shown that hemodialysis patients with longer months on dialysis tend to have lower total cholesterol TC levels This study extends data to examine lipid disturbances in 53 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis CAPD and 126 hemodialysis patients using multivariate analysis Longitudinal values after 910 months were measured in 16 CAPD patients and 52 hemodialysis patients Analysis of covariance for all patients demonstrated an inverse correlation of TC p  0003 highdensity lipoprotein HDL cholesterol p  001 and apolipoprotein AI levels p less than 002 with months on dialysis In addition the TC level was higher in women p less than 0001 and CAPD patients p less than 0001 and correlated with age p  002 and albumin p less than 0001 HDL cholesterol was higher in blacks p less than 0001 but was not affected by gender dialysis modality age or albumin Diabetic status serum parathyroid hormone and blood pressure were not significant variables for TC or HDLC The atherogenic risk indicators TCHDL cholesterol p less than 0001 and apolipoprotein B p less than 002 were higher in whites than in blacks Longitudinal study revealed lower TC levels in individual hemodialysis patients p less than 106 by paired ttest the fall being greater for patients with fewer total months on dialysis p less than 004 by analysis of covariance CAPD patients had no change in TC by paired ttestABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S178	Direct sidetoside portacaval anastomosis is employed exclusively in our institution to control variceal hemorrhage regardless of previous operative history A consecutive unselected group of 152 such patients was reviewed to ascertain the effect of previous major abdominal operation on operative difficulty and outcome Fifty patients with previous operations ranging from biliary and gastric procedures to thrombosed distal splenorenal shunts were compared with 102 previously unoperated patients This comparison led to the conclusions that sidetoside direct portacaval anastomosis may be carried out in patients with a previous major abdominal operation without an increased risk in mortality or morbidity and that although intraoperative blood loss and transfusion requirements were increased in previously operated patients these factors along with operative time could be minimized by use of intraoperative vasopressin and electrocautery Thus alternative shunting procedures with their increased thrombosis and rebleeding rates need not be considered in such patients
S179	Flow cytometric nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy analysis was done successfully on 38 specimens of primary bladder adenocarcinoma treated between 1954 and 1985 Of the specimens 10 26 were deoxyribonucleic acid diploid 8 21 were tetraploid and 20 53 were aneuploid Distribution of ploidy patterns between the 14 histological low grade and 24 high grade tumors was similar Of 38 tumors 35 92 showed muscle invasion One tumor arose in a previously exstrophied bladder 10 were of urachal origin and 27 arose in an anatomically normal bladder Of the urachal origin tumors 80 were deoxyribonucleic acid aneuploid At 5 and 10 years after diagnosis 80 and 70 respectively of the patients with diploid tumors were free of disease By contrast at 5 and 10 years after treatment only 20 and 12 respectively of the patients with nondiploid tumors have not had disease progression p less than 0001 logrank test None of the 6 patients with diploid high grade high stage muscle invasive tumors had subsequent progression In contrast 16 of 17 patients 94 with high grade high stage nondiploid tumors had either local or distant tumor recurrence p less than 00005 Nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid ploidy pattern appears to be the most significant prognostic information currently available to stratify expected prognosis for patients with muscle invasive adenocarcinoma of the bladder This test probably should be a standard tool in the clinical management of patients with this rare bladder malignancy
S180	Positron emission tomographic measurements of regional blood flow a marker of local neuronal activity were used to investigate the neuroanatomical correlates of a normal emotion Healthy volunteers were studied before during and after anticipation of a painful electric shock During anticipatory anxiety there were significant blood flow increases in bilateral temporal poles the same regions recently implicated in a lactateinduced anxiety attack in patients with panic disorder Thus the temporal poles seem to be involved in normal and pathological forms of human anxiety
S181	The pharmacokinetics of subcutaneously administered methotrexate was studied as a parenteral alternative to oral administration An initial feasibility study was performed in Rhesus monkeys comparing the subcutaneous route to intravenous IV injection and oral administration The subcutaneous dose was completely absorbed and a sustainedrelease effect was observed when compared with the IV dose No local or systemic toxicities resulted from subcutaneous methotrexate in the animals Twelve children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia on maintenance therapy protocols prescribing either 75 mgm2 biweekly or 40 mgm2 weekly were also monitored after both a subcutaneous and an oral dose of methotrexate Four children at the higher dosage level were also studied after an equal IV dose The subcutaneous dose was again completely absorbed in these children at both dose levels whereas the oral dose which produced comparable plasma drug concentrations at the lower dosage level resulted in a total drug exposure area under the plasma concentrationtime curve that was one third that of the equal subcutaneous dose at the higher dosage level No local or systemic toxicity was attributed to the subcutaneous methotrexate Subcutaneous administration of methotrexate is well tolerated and well absorbed and appears to overcome the problems associated with oral administration including variable absorption and saturation of the absorption mechanism with increasing doses
S182	We investigated whether inhibition of neutral endopeptidase 2411 NEP andor angiotensinconverting enzyme ACE modifies vagally induced nonadrenergic noncholinergic NANC airflow obstruction and airway microvascular leakage as measured by extravasation of Evans blue dye intravenous in anesthetized guinea pigs We gave phosphoramidon to inhibit NEP and enalapril maleate or captopril to inhibit ACE Animals pretreated with inhaled phosphoramidon 75 or 75 nmol enalapril maleate 87 or 870 nmol or captopril 350 nmol reached higher peak lung resistance RL values 143  27 157  38 167  38 114  16 and 246  35 cmH2Oml1s respectively than salinetreated animals 59  11 P less than 005 after bilateral vagus nerve stimulation 5 Hz 10 V 10 ms 150 s Intravenous phosphoramidon 1 mgkg but not intravenous captopril 6 mgkg potentiated peak RL 229  69 and 71  15 cmH2Oml1s respectively Vagal nerve stimulation 1 and 5 Hz increased the extravasation of Evans blue dye in tracheobronchial tissues compared with shamstimulated animals but this was not potentiated by inhaled enzyme inhibitors or intravenous captopril However intravenous phosphoramidon significantly augmented the extravasation of Evans blue dye in main bronchi and intrapulmonary airways We conclude that degradative enzymes regulate both NANCinduced airflow obstruction and airway microvascular leakage
S183	Procaterol hydrochloride aerosol a potent beta 2adrenergic bronchodilator was evaluated in a doubleblind placebocontrolled study for efficacy and safety in 210 patients with documented mild to moderate reversible airway obstruction Patients were randomized to receive procaterol in two inhalations high dose or one inhalation low dose 001 mginhalation three times daily or placebo Pulmonary function tests were recorded at five and 30 minutes and hourly for eight hours after the first dose and following 1 and 2 weeks of treatment Both doses of procaterol produced significantly greater improvement in PFTs at one hour and for up to seven hours after dosing compared with placebo p less than 005 Mean percent increases in FEV1 were 35 in the highdose group and 29 in the lowdose group at week 2 The highdose group showed no loss of duration of bronchodilation with continued dosing Improvement in PFTs and peak flow rates was significantly greater in the highdose than in the lowdose group p less than 005 Tremor was the most frequent side effect Procaterol had no effect on electrocardiograms heart rate blood pressure or clinical laboratory tests The high dose of procaterol aerosol was shown to be an effective and welltolerated bronchodilator with a rapid onset and long duration of action
S184	The relative contribution of several mechanisms to plasminogen activation and fibrin dissolution by urokinasetype plasminogen activator uPA in vitro was quantitated The activation of plasminogen by recombinant single chain uPA rscuPA by its two chain derivative rtcuPA and by a plasminresistant mutant rscuPAGlu158 obeys MichaelisMenten kinetics with catalytic efficiencies of 000064 0046 and 000005 Lmumols for native plasminogen Gluplasminogen and of 00061 121 and 00004 Lmumols for partially degraded plasminogen Lysplasminogen In a purified system consisting of a fibrin clot submerged in a plasminogen solution the equieffective doses 50 lysis in one hour for rscuPA rtcuPA and rscuPAGlu158 were 16 65 and 32000 ngmL for Gluplasminogen and two to fourfold lower for Lysplasminogen In a plasma milieu 50 lysis in two hours was obtained for a plasma clot with 21 microgramsmL rscuPA 05 microgramsmL rtcuPA and greater than 200 microgramsmL rscuPAGlu158 and for a purified fibrin clot with 13 microgramsmL rscuPA and 027 microgrammL rtcuPA After predigestion of a purified fibrin clot with plasmin the apparent potency of rscuPA and rtcuPA increased by 40 and 20 respectively In conclusion rscuPA has an intrinsic plasminogen activating potential that is only about 1 of that of rtcuPA and that is 13 times higher than that of rscuPAGlu158 Conformational transition of Gluplasminogen to Lysplasminogen enhances its sensitivity to activation by all uPA moieties ten to 20fold Predigestion of fibrin clots with associated increased binding of plasminogen results in a minor apparent increase of the fibrinolytic potency of rscuPA and rtcuPA The relative fibrinolytic potency of rtcuPA is two to three orders of magnitude higher than that of rscuPAGlu158 but only two to fivefold higher than that of rscuPA both in purified systems and in a plasma milieu These results indicate that conversion of rscuPA to rtcuPA constitutes the primary mechanism of fibrin dissolution
S185	The brain tissue pH oxygen tension and carbon dioxide tension were experimentally examined during profoundly hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass with core cooling and core rewarming Sixtyminute circulatory arrests n  28 group I 120minute lowflow perfusions 25 mlkgmin n  16 group II and 120minute moderateflow perfusions 50 mlkgmin n  16 group III were accomplished with and without pulsatile flow In group I progressive brain tissue acidosis and hypercapnia were recovered with pulsatile assistance In group II brain tissue acidosis and hypercapnia were recovered completely with pulsatile assistance but incompletely without it In group III mild acidosis was eliminated with pulsatile assistance where the pH was significantly higher than in groups I and II and brain tissue carbon dioxide pressure was significantly lower than in groups I and II with and without pulsatile assistance Brain tissue hypoxia was severe in group I slight in group II but not found in group III We concluded that a perfusion flow rate will decide the safe period and a pulsatile assistance will promote brain protection at any flow rate in profoundly hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass
S186	Although altered cytokine homeostasis has been implicated in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease the relationship between cytokines and metabolic consequences of alcoholic liver disease is unknown We therefore sought to correlate circulating concentrations of tumor necrosis factoralpha interleukin1 and interleukin6 to clinical and biochemical parameters of liver disease in chronic alcoholic patients We used an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay to measure plasma tumor necrosis factor and interleukin1 and a bioassay to measure serum interleukin6 in three groups of alcoholic men as follows a actively drinking alcoholic men without evidence of chronic liver disease b nondrinking alcoholic men with stable cirrhosis and c patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis Mean cytokine concentrations were elevated in cirrhotic patients and alcoholic hepatitis patients compared with controls and alcoholic patients without liver disease Tumor necrosis factoralpha and interleukin1 alpha concentrations remained elevated for up to 6 mo after diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis whereas interleukin6 normalized in parallel with clinical recovery Concentrations of all three cytokines were correlated with biochemical parameters of liver injury and hepatic protein synthesis plus serum immunoglobulin concentrations We could not demonstrate a relationship between cytokine concentrations and peripheral endotoxemia Percentages of peripheral blood monocytes that reacted with monoclonal antibodies to CD25 interleukin2 receptor and human lymphocyte antigenDR were similar for alcoholic patients and controls These data suggest that tumor necrosis factoralpha and interleukin1 alpha are related to some of the metabolic consequences of both acute and chronic alcoholinduced liver disease whereas interleukin6 is related to abnormalities seen in acute liver injury
S187	To investigate the correlation between blood flow rate and shear stress variation tauvariation the integral of time differential of wall shear stress in one cardiac cycle and the outcome of the vein graft 42 consecutive patients with femoropopliteal autovein grafts 24 in situ and 18 reversed grafts were followed for 3 months to 5 years after surgical repair No correlation was noted between the intraoperative blood flow rate and the outcome of the vein grafts with either procedure In contrast the tauvariation value of the vein grafts was closely related to their outcome with both procedures The higher the tauvariation the better the longterm results Vein grafts with a tauvariation of over 60 dyncm2 showed good longterm results The in situ grafts tended to have a higher tauvariation than the reversed grafts 67 in the in situ grafts vs 39 in the reversed grafts Late failures were noted in vein grafts with low tauvariation value within 3 years after surgery We recommend the in situ graft technique for patients undergoing femoropopliteal reconstruction with careful followup in cases of vein grafts with a low tauvariation value
S188	We retrospectively analyzed a program of prior deposit and storage of autologous blood that was used for patients who underwent elective orthopaedic procedures over a period of thirtysix months at the Walter Reed Army Medical Center Of a total of 211 patients who underwent total joint replacement or spinal fusion during this period and who had sufficient records to be included in the study a total of 159 patients enrolled in the program The fiftytwo patients who did not enroll in the study twelve of whom were rejected because of medical problems served as a control group Since the preoperative hematocrit values for patients in the group that received autologous blood were similar to those for the control group multiple preoperative phlebotomies in these patients who had received supplemental iron did not seem to have any deleterious effects One hundred and thirteen 71 per cent of the 159 patients who were enrolled in the program received only autologous blood The remaining fortysix patients required homologous blood also but 64 per cent of their transfusion needs were provided by autologous blood The only reactions to the transfusions in the study were in four patients who received homologous blood We think that a program of prior deposit and storage of autologous blood should be an option for patients who are to undergo elective orthopaedic surgery Such a program is well tolerated by the patients and easily managed by the staff and it was not difficult to implement at our tertiary referral hospital
S189	Studies in the West have shown that with advancing age there is progressive atrophy and fibrosis of the pancreas In addition there is a gradual increase in diameter of the main pancreatic duct MPD with age However there is a discrepancy between the findings at autopsy and findings at endoscopic retrograde pancreatography ERP To examine this issue ERP of subjects who were found not to show any abnormality of the biliary and pancreatic ducts were selected They were divided by decade from 10 to 70 years and for statistical analysis into young less than 40 and older greater than or equal to 40 patients There was no difference in length of the MPD between the two groups However the width of the MPD in the head was significantly greater in the older subjects group 2 mean  SD  378  097 mm compared with those who were less than 40 years group 1 297  071 mm p less than 0001 Similarly in the midbody the width of the MPD in group 2 286  09 mm was significantly greater compared with group 1 236  051 mm p less than 002 However there was no difference in width of the MPD in the tail between the two groups Length of the accessory pancreatic duct APD did not show any alteration with age but width was significantly greater in group 2 194  069 compared with group 1 149  051 p less than 005 No difference was observed in the length and width of the MPD or APD between male and female subjects of either groupABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S190	The in vitro activity of LY 264826 a new glycopeptide antibiotic was compared with that of vancomycin against 100 strains each of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium difficile LY 264826 was more active by weight than vancomycin against the isolates tested The human serum protein binding of LY 264826 was 153 range 98 to 218
S191	A total of 68 men with bladder outflow obstruction and chronic retention residual urine greater than 300 ml underwent investigation before and after prostatectomy with medium fill cystometry and natural fill longterm bladder pressure monitoring Postoperatively upper tract dilatation present in 28 men preoperatively resolved in all but 2 men and serum creatinine levels improved significantly Irritative and obstructive symptom scores improved postoperatively p less than 000006 although 17 of the men still had significant symptoms Residual urine volumes decreased and flow rates improved p less than 000006 but 32 of the men still had a residual urine of greater than 200 ml Urodynamic parameters improved during medium fill cystometry and longterm monitoring The main risk factors for upper tract dilatation are a pressure increase during bladder filling on conventional cystometry and the frequency of phasic detrusor activity during longterm monitoring and they decreased postoperatively
S192	To determine whether intraduodenal bile acids inhibit pancreatic secretion and cholecystokinin CCK release independent of pancreatic proteases experiments were conducted in rats with bile and pancreatic juice chronically diverted to the ileum Diversion of bile and pancreatic juice increased plasma CCK concentration to 191  40 pmolL Intraduodenal sodium taurocholate 78 mumolh reduced plasma CCK concentration to 66  15 pmolL after 1 hour but values increased to 173  23 pmolL after 135 hours despite continued taurocholate infusion Pancreatic protein secretion was also significantly but transiently inhibited by taurocholate However neither acute nor chronic intraduodenal bile infusion significantly reduced plasma CCK concentration compared with sodium bicarbonate infusion 134  19 pmolL vs 150  17 pmolL respectively Chronic 135 hours intraduodenal infusion of taurocholate plus pancreatic juice caused a sustained reduction of plasma CCK level to 31  05 pmolL which significantly increased to 94  11 pmolL after cessation of taurocholate but with continued infusion of pancreatic juice The results indicate that bile does not inhibit CCK release and that bile acids do not physiologically inhibit pancreatic secretion or CCK release independent of the presence of pancreatic proteases
S193	Following the observation of an unusually high number of patients presenting with duplex ureter in Dorchester a prospective study of 1930 autopsies was carried out in nine centres throughout the Wessex region The prevalence of duplex ureter in Dorchester was 25 5 of 200 autopsies but did not exceed 06 elsewhere The finding was confirmed by study of intravenous urograms in southwest Dorset carried out between 1982 and 1983 which showed a 60 prevalence of urinary tract duplication in radiographs from Dorchester
S194	In September 1988 a previously healthy 32yearold pregnant woman was hospitalized for pneumonia and died 8 days later The only pathogen detected was an influenza virus antigenically related to the swine influenza virus SIV Four days before illness onset the patient visited a county fair swine exhibition where there was widespread influenzalike illness among the swine To detect other persons who were possibly infected by contact with the ill swine we measured serum SIV hemagglutinationinhibition antibody titer in 25 swine exhibitors who were 9 to 19 years old Nineteen 76 had SIV hemagglutinationinhibition titers of 20 or greater Antibody was undetectable in serum samples from 25 swine exhibitors from a neighboring county Additional studies suggest that one to three health care personnel who had contact with the patient developed influenzalike illnesses with laboratory evidence of SIV infection An outbreak of apparent SIV infection in swine resulted in multiple human infections and although no recognized community outbreak resulted there was evidence of virus transmission from the patient to health care personnel
S195	The potential or actual involvement of the nervous system in injuries to the cervical spine requires that management must proceed with particular care Prevention of further injury is the main objective Proper management must begin with the removal of the athlete from the field and the correct procedures for doing this are reviewed Treatment procedures for the following injuries are discussed 1 nerve root and brachial plexus neurapraxia 2 acute cervical sprain syndrome 3 cervical vertebral subluxation without fracture 4 cervical fractures and dislocations 5 cervical spinal cord neurapraxia with transient quadriplegia and 6 cervical spinal instability Also guidelines for activity restrictions are presented
S196	Postoperative infection of the ascending aorta and aortic arch in 40 patients was treated by antibiotic therapy alone 4 patients or by operation and lifelong suppressive antibiotic therapy 36 patients Complications of infection included antibioticresistant infection infected false aneurysm rupture of suture line aortocutaneous fistulas aorticright ventricular fistulas arterial embolus aortic valve insufficiency aortobronchial fistula mediastinal abscess and chest wall problems These were treated by a variety of operations including composite valvegraft replacement graft replacement patchgraft closure of false aneurysm simple suture of disrupted suture lines and false aneurysm and debridement of mediastinum and chest wall The area of reconstruction was covered and mediastinal dead space was reduced by mobilization of viable tissue including local tissue and distant structures such as flaps of muscle and omentum Thirtythree patients 83 were early survivors and 28 patients 70 were alive and well at last followup 4 months to 65 years after operation
S197	Populations of peripheral blood T lymphocytes from patients with Kenyan visceral leishmaniasis were studied using specifically defined antisera monoclonal antibodies Orthomune OKT3 OKT4 OKT6 and OKT8 The levels of total T lymphocytes and circulating thymocytes were within the same range as those of clinically normal individuals However the proportions of the helperinducer T cells were lower in untreated patients than in the controls 189 vs 397 while the levels of suppressorcytotoxic T cells were higher than in the controls 405 vs 278 After successful antileishmania treatment these levels showed a gradual return towards normal over a period of one year It was concluded that immunosuppression observed is due to the levels of peripheral blood helperinducer and suppressorcytotoxic T lymphocytes
S198	The role of the 3 end of mRNA in coupling between the level of histone mRNAs and DNA synthesis was examined We introduced modified mouse histone H3 genes into mouse fibroblasts and studied the regulation of several different H3 mRNAs that are not terminated with a normal histone 3 end In two cases the stemloop sequences were deleted from the mRNAs and replaced either by 3 sequences flanking the H3 gene or by globin 3 untranslated region sequences including the polyadenylylation signal In the former case approximately equal to 50 of the modified mRNA was polyadenylylated whereas in the latter case all of the mRNA had a polyadenylylated terminus In contrast to the normal histone mRNAs these mRNAs including the nonadenylylated form were stable when DNA synthesis was inhibited with several drugs The levels of two other histone mRNAs each containing the stemloop sequences as an internal part of the mRNA also were stable when DNA synthesis was inhibited These results indicate that the posttranscriptional coupling of histone mRNA levels to DNA synthesis requires the presence of the stemloop sequences at the 3 end of the mRNA
S199	The purpose of the study was to evaluate the neuromuscular transmission defect in preeclamptic women receiving intravenous magnesium sulfate and to study the correlation of the degree of defect with serum magnesium and calcium levels The study population included group 1 14 preeclamptic women receiving magnesium sulfate and undergoing induction of labor group 2 six preeclamptic women studied in the postpartum period while receiving magnesium sulfate and group 3 10 normotensive women undergoing induction of labor The neuromuscular transmission studies were performed with standard techniques before and during the administration of magnesium sulfate During magnesium sulfate therapy patients in groups 1 and 2 showed abnormal responses characterized by an initial lowamplitude muscle action potential followed by a progressive increase in the amplitudes of the successive responses There was significant correlation between the degree of the neuromuscular transmission defect and serum magnesium levels serum calcium levels and the magnesiumcalcium ratio in groups 1 and 2 All studies were normal in group 3 The findings confirm the occurrence of abnormal neuromuscular transmission in preeclamptic women receiving magnesium sulfate and the intensity of the defect correlates significantly with increased serum magnesium levels and decreased serum calcium levels
S200	We studied the effect of cooling on the responses of isolated human airways to the betaagonist isoproterenol the alphabetaagonist norepinephrine in the presence of the betablocker timolol methacholine leukotriene C4 LTC4 and histamine In addition the effect of cooling on baseline airway tone and responses to electric field stimulation EFS was studied At 27 degrees C the sensitivity logEC50 and maximal response to isoproterenol were unchanged No measurable response was found to alphaadrenergic stimulation with norepinephrine  timolol either before or during cooling At 27 degrees C and 21 degrees C the sensitivity and maximal contraction to methacholine and LTC4 as well as the contraction to a single dose of histamine were reduced Cooling diminished baseline airway tone EFS produced a rapid cholinergic contraction followed by a deflection below baseline and a sustained noncholinergic contractile response which was substantially reduced by the LTC4D4 receptor antagonist FPL 55712 115 microM at all three temperatures Cooling decreased the cholinergic response to EFS and increased the sensitivity to EFSinduced relaxation In contrast the sustained noncholinergic contractile response to EFS was not changed suggesting that cooling facilitates the synthesis of LTC4D4 that follows EFS andor inhibits its inactivation We conclude that in nonasthmatic isolated human airways slow cooling of the airway wall down to 21 degrees C does not cause bronchoconstriction and does not increase the responsiveness to contractile or relaxing agonists However cooling increases the sensitivity to EFSinduced relaxation and might facilitate the accumulation of leukotriene C4D4 in the airway wallABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S201	Nuclear extracts derived from HeLa and Drosophila melanogaster KC cell lines have been found to correct single basebase mispairs within open circular DNA heteroduplexes containing a strandspecific sitespecific incision located 808 base pairs from the mismatch Correction in both extract systems is strand specific being highly biased to the incised DNA strand Different mispairs within a homologous set of heteroduplexes were processed with different efficiencies GT greater than GG approximately equal to AC greater than CC and correction was accompanied by mismatchdependent DNA synthesis localized to the region spanning the mispair and the strand break thus demonstrating that mismatch recognition is associated with the repair reaction Correction of each of these heteroduplexes was abolished by aphidicolin but was relatively insensitive to the presence of high concentrations of ddTTP indicating probable involvement of alpha andor delta class DNA polymerases These findings suggest that higher eukaryotic cells possess a general strandspecific mismatch repair system analogous to the Escherichia coli mutHLS and the Streptococcus pneumoniae hexAB pathways systems that contribute in a major way to the genetic stability of these bacterial species
S202	A case of a highflow mandibular vascular malformation successfully treated with combined selective embolization resection and reconstruction is reported
S203	Thirteen patients seven with acute myocardial infarction and six survivors of sudden death after sport underwent coronary angiography within a mean of 104 min after the onset of symptoms The admission electrocardiogram showed transmural myocardial ischemia in all patients The ischemiarelated vessel was occluded in all cases of sudden death and in three cases of acute myocardial infarction Reperfusion was achieved in eight vessels after intracoronary streptokinase in three after intracoronary nitroglycerin in three and mechanically in two Coronary spasm was demonstrated in three vessels and coronary thrombi in four The coronary lesion was described as either concentric in two or eccentric with irregular borders in eight There was a high incidence of eccentric lesions consistent with ruptured plaques The acute coronary angiographic findings of acute myocardial infarction and sudden death after sport are similar Physical exercise can provoke myocardial infarction and sudden death probably by inducing plaque rupture that can evoke coronary spasm thrombosis or both
S204	To determine whether the changes induced in serum hormone levels by strenuous exercise are accompanied by changes in bone density we obtained medical sports and dietary histories trabecular bone density percentage body fat and serum hormone concentrations in collegiate athletes for comparison with those of college students not involved in organized strenuous exercise Several important observations emerged from this study of collegiate athletes First the eumenorrheic athletes began sports training earlier than the oligomenorrheic athletes Second oligomenorrheic athletes displayed significantly lower serum estradiol concentrations during cycle weeks 2 and 3 but had a rise in this hormone concentration during cycle week 4 Significant differences in serum gonadotropin concentrations during week 4 were found in the oligomenorrheic athletes Finally no significant difference in spinal mineral density values was found in the three groups
S205	To determine whether the variation in the magnitude of work load sustained by the left and right ventricles during adulthood and senescence affects the loaddependent aspect of relaxation posterior papillary muscles from the left and right ventricles of rats at 4 10 and 20 months of age were studied under variably loaded conditions in vitro Because of differences between the life spans of Fischer and SpragueDawley rats the functional characteristics of relaxation were investigated to evaluate the possibility of a differential ageassociated response in these two strains of animals The kinetic performance of the diastolic phase of myocardial contraction was measured by assessing the relative time during which load bearing occurred in a series of afterloaded isotonic twitches This measurement was expressed as the ratio of the duration of afterloaded isotonic shortening and relengthening to the time required for isometric force to decline to the same level during isometric relaxation A ratio of less than unity identified a loaddependent state whereas a value greater than one reflected a loadindependent condition Results showed that the right myocardium was completely load independent whereas the left myocardium was fully load dependent at all physiological afterloads Aging reduced the load independence of the right ventricle and the load dependence of the left ventricle in Fischer rats In contrast no aging effect on the properties of afterloaded isotonic relaxation was seen in SpragueDawley rats In conclusion distinct differences exist in the mechanical dynamics of inactivation between the left and right ventricular myocardium Aging reduced these variations in Fischer rats but had no apparent influence in SpragueDawley animals up to 20 months after birth
S206	We studied accommodation and vergence eye movements in a patient with a left middle cerebral artery embolism Accommodation was monitored by an infrared optometer with the accommodative target being controlled by a microcomputer Computed tomography showed lowdensity areas in the left cortex with intact brainstem The patient had convergence palsy and accommodation abnormalities The amplitude of the accommodative responses was reduced and the accommodation velocity was markedly lowered Our results further substantiate the neurologic relationship between the cerebral cortex and accommodation and convergence
S207	The use of tracheostomies in burned patients with inhalation injuries is now reserved for specific indications rather than as prophylactic airway management A 5year burn center experience with tracheostomies used in this fashion is presented Ninetynine tracheostomies were performed in 3246 patients who had indications of prolonged respiratory failure or acute loss of airway Although colonization of the sputum was universal neither rates of pulmonary sepsis nor mortality were significantly increased in patients who underwent tracheostomies Twentyeight patients developed late upper airway sequelae including tracheal stenosis TS tracheoesophageal fistula TEF and tracheoarterial fistula TAF Duration of intubation correlated only with development of TAF whereas patients in whom TEF developed were significantly older and more likely to have evidence of tracheal necrosis at the time of tracheostomy The pathogenesis of upper airway sequelae in these patients as divergent responses to the combined insults of inhalation injury infection and intubation is considered
S208	Previous studies have demonstrated an increase in a low molecular weight angiogenic factor ESAF present in the retinae of kittens with oxygen induced retinopathy The present paper describes differences in the quantity of ESAF extracted from the vitreous humour of control and oxygen treated animals and proposes a mechanism for the induction of intravitreal neovascularisation
S209	The modified Schollner costoplasty is a cosmetic procedure for the correction of rib prominence deformity in scoliosis We present the results of the procedure in 21 patients who had previously undergone spinal fusion for scoliosis We found the procedure to be well tolerated without major complications Objective cosmetic improvement was achieved in all but one case All but one patient considered the procedure to have been of cosmetic benefit
S210	There is a wide variance in the reported values for the diagnostic accuracy of fine needle aspiration FNA cytologic study and its role in the management of palpable lumps of the breast is controversial For these reasons the results of 350 aspirations of the breast performed at this unit were analyzed and the benefits of aspiration cytology were evaluated The results were encouraging with a diagnostic accuracy rate of 950 per cent a sensitivity rate of 740 per cent a specificity rate of 996 per cent and a positive predictive value of 980 per cent There was one falsepositive result emphasizing that aspiration cytology must be used in combination with other indicants of the nature of a mammary lump The sites and the age of presentation of both benign and malignant lesions of the breast were briefly examined Limitations of this technique were also discussed A positive FNA result may obviate the need for frozen section FNA cytology has been found to be a useful and accurate adjunct in the diagnosis of the nature of mammary lumps and is now an integral part in the management of these patients in this unit
S211	This review critically examines the literature of the past 10 years relating to the use of drugs in treating alcohol intoxication withdrawal and dependence Emphasis is given to those studies that have current and potential future clinical relevance Although research regarding the pharmacological treatment of alcohol disorders still suffers from methodological flaws and lukewarm acceptance the recognition of this area as a legitimate and fruitful field of study is increasingly apparent
S212	A retrospective study with review after 3 years of 43 children between the ages of 4 and 13 years who had bilateral otitis media with effusion treated surgically purely by the insertion of grommets is described The results shows that the younger the child at initial grommet insertion the greater the likelihood of more than 1 grommet insertion being required P less than 005 A younger patient is likely to make a greater number of outpatient visits P less than 005 and the number of outpatient visits correlates with the number of grommets inserted P less than 001 At 3 years 49 of children remained on regular outpatient followup while 34 of children had persisting effusion in 1 or more ears Whilst grommets are in place otorrhoea is not adversely influenced by swimming The role of adenoidectomy in the management of otitis media with effusion is not assessed by this study
S213	Twentyfour rabbits with surgically induced osteoarthritis of the knee were allocated into three treatment groups placebo Sadenosylmethionine SAMe 30 mgkg per day and SAMe 60 mgkg per day Intramuscular administration of drug or placebo was begun immediately after surgery and continued for 12 consecutive weeks At the end of the treatment period animals were killed and the articular surfaces of the knees were studied using histologic and histochemical techniques Microscopic studies showed that the number of cells and the depth of the cartilage were significantly p less than 0001 increased in SAMetreated rabbits in comparison with placebotreated animals No difference was found in comparing data in animals given SAMe at the two dosage levels In conclusion these results suggest a chondroprotective effect of SAMe in animals with experimental osteoarthritis
S214	Surveys conducted by the American College of Surgeons indicate an increasing trend toward the treatment of primary breast cancer by segmental mastectomy and radiotherapy This operation has never been formally taught in training programs and scant standard descriptive material exists The National Surgical Adjuvant Breast Project conducted a series of workshops to develop guidelines for the performance of the operation The essential points are 1 pathologic control of margins to ensure complete surgical excision 2 surgical principles of complete tumor excision 3 attention to optimum cosmetic results and 4 axillary dissection for accurate staging and regional control of the disease This article summarizes the recommendations made at those workshops
S215	To assess what factors determine the involuntary status of psychiatric patients we reviewed the case records of 5729 patients consecutively admitted to one of four inpatient psychiatric facilities including a mental hospital in St Johns between October 1975 and October 1978 Of the 5729 patients 5005 874 were voluntary and 724 126 involuntary Involuntary patients were more likely than voluntary patients to be male single and unemployed and to have been referred by police or transferred from another facility to the mental hospital where most of the involuntary admissions occurred They had higher rates of previous admissions to a psychiatric facility and of suicidal and violent behaviour were more likely to have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or mania and were less likely to be suffering from depression or a neurotic disorder In correspondence with differences in diagnosis involuntary patients stayed in hospital more than twice as long as voluntary patients were less likely to receive electroconvulsive therapy minor tranquillizers and antidepressants and were more likely to receive neuroleptics and lithium carbonate Stepwise logistic regression analysis revealed that only the source of referral and a diagnosis of neurotic disorder had an independent effect on admission status The findings are discussed in the context of the controversy over the parens patriae approach v the legal approach to involuntary admission of psychiatric patients
S216	Between January 1983 and October 1989 290 patients underwent an arterial switch operation for transposition of the great arteries 30 103 of the patients had abnormalities of the left ventricular outflow tract or mitral valve or both These abnormalities included isolated pulmonary valve stenosis n  9 septal dynamic subpulmonary stenosis n  5 anatomic fixed subpulmonary stenosis n  7 abnormal mitral chordae attachments n  2 or a combination of abnormalities n  7 There were two early deaths one of which was due to previously unrecognized mitral stenosis and a subpulmonary neoaortic membrane and one late death due to presumed coronary obstruction Of the nine patients with pulmonary valve abnormalities due to either a bicommissural n  5 or a thickened tricommissural n  4 valve only one underwent valvotomy Peak systolic ejection gradients in these nine patients measured preoperatively ranged from 0 to 50 mm Hg At followup study 5 to 30 months postoperatively the neoaortic valve gradient was less than or equal to 15 mm Hg in all patients three patients had mild neoaortic regurgitation Preoperative gradients may overestimate the degree of obstruction because of the increased pulmonary blood flow present in transposition No patient with dynamic subpulmonary obstruction before the arterial switch operation had a surgical procedure performed on the left ventricular outflow tract none had evidence of subaortic obstruction after the arterial switchABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S217	Two hundred fifty consecutive patients treated for one or two vessel coronary artery disease with either balloon angioplasty or surgical bypass were monitored for 3 years in a study designed to determine the comparative longterm effectiveness of each treatment The 125 patients having angioplasty were matched with the 125 patients having bypass so that both groups had a similar number of patients with single or double vessel disease The two groups did not significantly differ in age malefemale ratio New York Heart Association class or risk factors The ejection fraction was 54  11 in the angioplasty group and 49  12 mmHg in the surgical patients p  00031 Angioplasty was deemed initially successful in 88 110125 unsuccessful in 10 12125 and in 2 3125 the lesion could not be crossed Emergency bypass was performed in 10 12125 Four of the 125 angioplasty patients 3 died within 30 days Coronary artery bypass grafting was successfully performed on the matched set of surgical patients with 99 124125 discharged well There was one 1 1125 surgical death The average hospital stay per patient was 48  31 days for angioplasty and 121  42 days for bypass grafting p  00000 Threeyear postprocedure followup was obtained on 96 236 of the 245 patients discharged alive A second angioplasty was required in 18 and 11 angioplasty patients subsequently required surgical bypass Overall 19 23121 of the angioplasty patients ultimately required bypass Four late deaths occurred in the angioplasty group which brought the early and late mortality rates to 7 8121 There were two late surgical deaths which brought the combined surgical mortality to 25 3120 p  01263 Patient evaluation reveals that 63 76121 of the angioplasty group are alive and in New York Heart Association class I or II 3 years after one or two angioplasty procedures This figure compares with 92 110120 of surgical patients alive and in the same two New York Heart Association classes p  00000
S218	Partial hepatectomy PH initiates cellular signals for regeneration Sequential expression of nuclear and cytosolic protooncogenes accompanies the restoration of normal liver function and architecture Although cirrhosis is known to inhibit liver regeneration the effects of noncirrhotic cholestasis on hepatocellular proliferation differentiation and regulatory gene expression are unknown To examine this 25 male Fisher rats underwent common bile duct ligation and division A 47  5 PH was performed 10 days after common bile duct ligation and division when histologic analysis revealed cholestasis without cirrhosis Despite early elevations of total hepatic DNA and RNA values cholestatic livers demonstrated a significant threefold suppression of expected hepatocyte mitotic indexes 48 and 72 hours after PH compared with livers after PH alone Weight restoration in cholestatic livers was 11  52 compared with 40  43 in control livers  SEM p less than 0001 5 days after PH Analysis of regenerating liver messenger RNA with complementary DNA probes revealed an abnormal sustained elevation of Kras expression in cholestatic livers through all time points Cholestasis blunted but did not obliterate normal sequential elevations in Hras found in control livers The expression of cmyc was inhibited threefold with cholestasis 72 hours after PH These results are the first indication that cholestasis alone inhibits hepatocyte proliferation and the expression of cmyc that normally precedes the first wave of mitosis This implies that cholestasis without cirrhosis may alter programmed liver gene expression inhibiting normal hepatic regeneration
S219	The ventilatory effects of morphine6glucuronide M6G and morphine3glucuronide M3G were evaluated in awake dogs n  10 A fourth ventricle to cisterna magna perfusion VCP system was used for drug administration This permitted a direct comparison of the doseventilatory response characteristics of these morphine metabolites to each other and to morphine and obviated the need to consider the bloodbrain barrier delay that would complicate analysis of systemic dose versus ventilatory response relationships among these drugs The doseresponse pattern for morphine was taken from an earlier study in unanesthetized dogs where the identical mode of drug delivery as in the present report was employed Morphine3glucuronide caused if anything a ventilatory stimulation decreased PaCO2 and increased CO2 responsiveness at the highest infusate concentration studied 50 microgramsml and no significant ventilatory effects at infusate concentrations at or below 10 microgramsml On the other hand M6G produced a profound dosedependent ventilatory depression Significant increases in PaCO2 and diminution of CO2 responsiveness were observed even at the lowest infusate concentration evaluated 01 microgramml When compared to morphine M6G was found to be about five to ten times more potent as a ventilatory depressant drug These results imply that M6G may play a significant role in the ventilatory depression accompanying systemic morphine administration
S220	This study reports breathanalyzer readings and selfreports as measures of alcoholrelated admission to the emergency room of San Francisco General Hospital A 20 probability sample of patients admitted during a 60day period was breath analyzed and interviewed Interviews and breath samples were obtained on 75 of the sample of 2516 patients Twice the proportion of injury patients compared to noninjury patients had positive admission breath samples and reported drinking prior to the event Alcohol involvement reached 41 for selfreports among injured men and over half of both men and women injured in fights or assaults reported drinking prior to the event Selfreported alcohol use was found to be a valid measure of alcohol consumption when compared to breathanalyzer readings for the same individuals Emergency room patients may be more likely than others to provide accurate reports of alcohol consumption if they feel that disclosure of amount and timing of drinking prior to an injury or illness could be important in their care The data suggest that selfreports when used in conjunction with a quantifiable estimate of blood alcohol may be an appropriate method of ascertaining alcohols involvement in emergency room cases
S221	The affinity and stoichiometry of DNA binding by Escherichia coli trp repressor were studied by electrophoresis in nondenaturing gels The ability of trp repressor to retard the electrophoretic mobility of an operator DNA fragment depends on the pH of the gel system Above the pI of the protein little retardation of DNA is observed although complex formation can be detected by other assays As the pH of the gel is lowered retardation is enhanced The apparent dissociation constant for the interaction between trp repressor and trpEDCBA operator fragments is 05 nM under the conditions used here Nonspecific binding occurs with only about 200fold weaker affinity The stoichiometries of specific and nonspecific complexes were determined directly by using trp repressor labeled in vivo Highaffinity operator binding requires a single dimer of trp repressor DNase Iprotection analysis footprinting was used to confirm the dissociation constants and to locate the binding site
S222	Pityrosporum ovale is a lipophilic yeast commonly present in the seborrheic areas of the skin of adults Fiftyfive young adult patients with atopic dermatitis 19 patients with seborrheic dermatitis and 19 healthy control subjects were examined for immune reactions to P ovale including tests for specific IgE antibodies prick test histamine release IgG antibodies and epicutaneous testing IgE antibodies against P ovale were found in two thirds of the patients with atopic dermatitis and were more frequent in patients with lesions predominantly in the seborrheic areas In addition some atopic patients had positive reactions to epicutaneous tests which suggest that delayed allergic reactions to P ovale may also be important In patients with seborrheic dermatitis no evidence of immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to P ovale was found IgG antibody levels were low in all groups
S223	An 18yearold girl with virilization and an elevated level of serum alphafetoprotein AFP was found to have a SertoliLeydig cell tumor SLCT of the ovary The tumor had a heterologous element of gastrointestinal type epithelium retiform pattern and multilocular cysts many of which were lined by Sertolilike cells Alphafetoprotein was detected immunohistochemically in cells with the histologic appearance of Sertoli cells and testosterone was detected in the Leydig cells Results of lectin affinity chromatography indicated that AFP produced by this tumor was different from the AFP to be found in the liver
S224	Functional assessments associated with rehabilitation frequently rely on scoring systems based upon a limited set of categorical values arranged in order and intended to represent an underlying performance continuum Making sense of data generated by these scales is a challenge well met by the Rasch measurement model which allows detailed investigation of how individuals are likely to perform on a given occasion and indicates whether changes in performance occur in orderly patterns over repeated occasions Additionally the Rasch measurement model allows study of the quality of measurement and the degree to which the scoring adequately reflects the underlying but not directly measurable continuum Data gathered at admission and discharge from 330 patients attending a rehabilitation program for chronic low back pain were evaluated using the Rasch measurement model and the results were contrasted with those from the best available nonparametric technique ridit analysis
S225	G proteins have been implicated in the development of opioid dependence of the guinea pig myenteric plexus as chronic fentanyl elevates G0i alpha and pertussis toxin prevents this phenomenon Therefore the present study investigates G proteins more closely in this peripheral nerve plexus after chronic exposure to addictive drugs of the opiate and nonopiate type After 6 days of treatment with either the mu receptor ligand fentanyl the kappa agonist U50488H or the alpha2 adrenergic receptor ligand clonidine at doses which render the myenteric plexus tolerant and dependent the G protein subunits Go alpha and G beta were quantified by immunoblot analysis by using polyclonal antisera Regardless of the drug used these G proteins were found to be significantly increased in particulate membrane preparations linked to nerve somata and nerve terminals This increase in G protein subunits is developed maximally after 6 days is dosedependent and reversible upon termination of the drug supply The concentrations found elevated return to control levels within 4 to 5 days after commencing withdrawal The common increase of Go alpha and G beta subunits observed after chronic opiate or clonidine exposure is associated with the phenomenon of crossdependence among all drugs studied The findings may suggest that in the guinea pig myenteric plexus multiple inhibitory receptor types make use of a common pool of G proteins
S226	Granular cell tumor GCT of the esophagus is a rarelymetwith neoplasm It is almost invariably benign in character and is of stilldisputed histogenesis Small lesions are asymptomatic Those over 1 cm in diameter may be accompanied by painful swallowing or retrosternal discomfort Local resection is the treatment of choice for lesions that are accompanied by symptoms or that are larger than 1 cm A tumor incidentally encountered in an asymptomatic patient may be safely followed endoscopically A successful endoscopic removal of such a lesion is described
S227	A case of superior mesenteric artery aneurysm secondary to infectious endocarditis is presented Although selective angiography was necessary to detect the shape and precise location of the aneurysm noninvasive diagnostic techniques including ultrasonography and computed tomography were also useful in detecting the aneurysm and planning the management of this unusual condition Mitral valve replacement and aneurysmorrhaphy with bypass grafting of the superior mesenteric artery were successfully performed
S228	Monocyte emigration into areas of inflammation is initiated by monocyte adherence to the microvascular endothelium which may be induced by the local production of chemotactic factors at the inflammatory site However it is not clear whether such stimuli act on the monocyte andor the endothelial cell to promote this effect Accordingly the effect of the chemotactic peptides C5a des arg and formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine FMLP on human monocyte adherence to human microvascular endothelial cell monolayers was investigated in vitro Monocytes 92 to 98 pure were isolated by discontinuous plasmaPercoll density gradients and cell elutriation methods designed to minimize monocyte exposure to endotoxin Mean spontaneous unstimulated adherence of 111Indiumtropolonateradiolabeled monocytes to microvascular endothelial cell monolayers was 197  13 Monocyte adherence to microvascular endothelial cell monolayers was stimulated in a doseresponse fashion in the presence of C5a des arg or FMLP to a maximum mean adherence of 472  29 or 438  22 respectively C5a des arg or FMLP stimulated monocytes to adhere to monolayers of human vascular smooth muscle cells human dermal fibroblasts or serumcoated plastic wells in a comparable fashion as to endothelial cells The simultaneous presence of both chemotactic peptides C5a des arg and FMLP in the assay system stimulated monocyte adherence to the same degree as either stimulus alone This finding suggested that those monocytes stimulated to adhere by C5a des arg were the same subpopulation responding to FMLP Spontaneous monocyte adherence in the absence of chemotactic peptides to both endothelial cell monolayers and serumcoated plastic wells was reduced in the presence of plasma but chemotactic peptides induced a significant albeit reduced adhesion of monocytes in this circumstance The pretreatment of monocytes with either C5a des arg or FMLP prior to the adherence assay induced stimulusspecific desensitization of monocyte adherence Neither a desensitization nor stimulated monocyte adherence occurred when endothelial cell monolayers or serumcoated plastic wells were pretreated with either of the chemotactic peptides The fixation of endothelial cell monolayers prior to the adherence assay did not alter the degree of spontaneous C5a des argstimulated or FMLPstimulated monocyte adherence These data suggest that the stimulated adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells by C5a des arg or FMLP represents primarily an effect of these chemotactic peptides on the monocyte
S229	Islet cell carcinoma frequently produces more than one chemical product although its clinical expression is usually restricted to a single hormone We describe an unusual patient who presented with fullblown metastasizing gastrinoma He was treated with cimetidine for five years and then streptozotocin therapy which resulted in a regression in hepatomegaly and a fall in serum gastrin levels Following one years therapy with streptozotocin he was admitted in hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemic stupor This appears to be the first reported case of a shift from clinical gastrinoma to insulinoma possibly related to prolonged streptozotocin therapy
S230	A prospective randomized study was utilized to compare the effectiveness of a single dose of preoperative piperacillin versus tripledose cefoxitin in prophylaxis for elective colorectal operations All patients received a simple 1 day mechanical bowel preparation using 10 percent mannitol preparation administered orally Ninetyfour patients were entered into the study Septic complications occurred in 9 percent of the piperacillin patients and in 12 percent of the cefoxitin patients
S231	The cause of abnormal Q waves in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy remains unclear Myocardial wall thickness was assessed by twodimensional echocardiography at 8 left ventricular and 10 right ventricular sites in 67 patients mean age 40 years with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the findings were analyzed in relation to the presence of abnormal Q waves on the 12 lead rest electrocardiogram ECG Nineteen 28 of the 67 patients had abnormal Q waves Right ventricular hypertrophy was significantly more common in patients without abnormal Q waves 25 52 of 48 versus 2 11 of 19 p less than 0001 With univariate analysis there were six measurements that were significantly associated with abnormal Q waves an increase in upper anterior septal thickness p less than 0005 and maximal left ventricular wall thickness p less than 002 a decrease in mean and maximal right ventricular wall thickness both p less than 0005 and an increase in the ratio of both upper anterior septal to mean right ventricular wall thickness p less than 0005 and upper anterior septal to upper posterior wall thickness p less than 0005 With multivariate analysis only the ratios of upper anterior septal to mean right ventricular wall thickness p less than 0005 and to upper posterior wall thickness p less than 005 were significantly related to the presence of abnormal Q waves and predicted Q wave location with a sensitivity specificity and predictive accuracy of 90 88 and 89 respectively In hypertrophic cardiomyopathy the presence of abnormal Q waves on the 12 lead ECG is primarily a function of the relation of right ventricular wall thickness and upper anterior septal thickness
S232	The role of the macrophage in destruction of virulent treponemes is disputed A major obstacle has been the inability to demonstrate quantitative phagocytosis of treponemes by macrophages Treponema pallidum pertenue was attached to polycarbonate filters for assessment of treponemal phagocytosis by macrophages The disappearance of treponemes due to phagocytosis was measured by enumeration with immunofluorescence Resident and lipopolysaccharideactivated macrophages were found to phagocytize treponemes equally well The phagocytosis of killed treponemes by macrophages was enhanced by opsonization with immune serum Macrophages successfully phagocytized Staphylococcus aureus organisms when they were incubated on filters under identical conditions Treatment of macrophages with cytochalasin B a known inhibitor of phagocytosis prevented the disappearance of treponemes and phagocytosis of S aureus In addition fluorescent treponemal debris was observed only inside macrophages cultured with treponemes These results demonstrate that macrophages can phagocytize pathogenic treponemes on polycarbonate filters
S233	Spasticity has been defined as velocitydependent hyperactivity of stretch reflexes it is therefore only one aspect of the complex syndrome produced by a lesion of the upper motoneuron Although spasticity may be partially responsible for joint contractures it does not produce most of the functional disability experienced by patients with upper motoneuron lesions Paresis fatigability lack of dexterity etc account for most of these patients complaints The pathophysiology of spasticity is poorly understood but appears to be related to an increased excitatory state at the segmental spinal level there is no evidence for increased sensitivity of muscle spindles in spastic patients Several mechanisms for this increased excitability within the spinal cord have been proposed There are different types as well as degrees of spasticity Clinical neurophysiologic recordings of reflex activity in patients with spasticity provide the means to differentiate among the various types of spasticity to select the therapy most likely to be effective in a particular patient and to see the results of its employment objectively The latter will prove whether a specific therapy is useful or not Ablative treatment at the level of the peripheral nerve or dorsal root may be useful particularly when spasticity is severe Drugs such as baclofen or diazepam relieve flexor spasms but are not particularly effective against spasticity itself Dantrolene acts to weaken muscles but that is not often helpful Rarely do any of these therapies increase function there are no effective cures for paresis or related negative manifestations of chronic spasticity
S234	Fifty patients with warts were treated with cryotherapy and given a 100item questionnaire The Tennessee SelfConcept Scale to complete Responses from 42 patients on whom followup data were available were subjected to computer analysis The answers to eight of the questions differed significantly between treatment cures 23 and treatment failures 19 Further analysis of two of the eight questions showed that it may be possible to use them to predict cryosurgical treatment success or failure in up to 100 of cases
S235	We report cumulative results of the transsphenoidal microsurgical treatment of Cushing disease in 221 patients 173 patients had selective adenomectomy 25 had total hypophysectomy 6 had partial hypophysectomy and 12 had exploration only Five patients were excluded from analysis because intraoperative technical difficulties precluded exposure of the pituitary gland The selection of candidates for transsphenoidal exploration was based on endocrinologic criteria Magnetic resonance imaging was the preferred radiologic test Selective venous sampling of adrenocorticotropic hormone further refined the diagnosis when endocrinologic and radiologic procedures were not definitive Remission of disease was achieved in 164 of 216 76 patients analyzed 95 CI 69 to 81 Among patients with histologic confirmation of adenomas the percentage having remission was significantly higher P less than 0001 in patients with microadenomas than in patients with macroadenomas and in patients with intrasellar adenomas than in patients with extrasellar extension of their adenoma or perforation of the sellar floor by adenoma P less than 0001 Five patients had an ectopic source of adrenocorticotropic hormone secretion Two patients had diffuse pituitary hyperplasia Complications occurred in 93 of the patients including two deaths that were apparently unrelated to surgery CI 54 to 13 The results indicate that transsphenoidal surgery is the preferred treatment for most patients with Cushing disease
S236	This report reviews experiences in the management of 37 cases of central giant cell granuloma of the jaws The statistical analysis includes location age sex size on initial presentation and other variables relating to incidence and distribution The technique of curettage or curettage with peripheral ostectomy was used in all cases treated surgically resulting in no evidence of disease in 21 out of 23 cases followed postoperatively for 2 or more years Radiation therapy was curative in one instance Preoperative endodontic therapy for teeth in the field of surgery has proved to be advantageous The pathogenesis of the giant cell granuloma of the jaws is discussed
S237	Doxazosin was administered once daily to 26 patients with renal hypertension or hypertension associated with renal dysfunction Doxazosin produced a significant reduction in blood pressure that was stable throughout the treatment period A significant change was not observed in heart rate Blood pressure was markedly decreased or decreased in 80 of patients receiving doxazosin monotherapy 786 of patients receiving combined therapy and 792 of all the patients The cumulative efficacy ratio according to final daily dose was 625 with 1 to 4 mgday and 750 to 792 with 8 to 16 mgday Side effects were observed in three patients 120 none of them severe and all side effects disappeared with continued administration of doxazosin Abnormal laboratory values in six items were observed in four patients Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen values which were regarded as renal function parameters did not show significant changes and no negative influence was observed with respect to doxazosin therapy Overall clinical usefulness was considered very useful or useful in 80 of patients receiving doxazosin monotherapy 786 of patients receiving combination therapy and 792 of all patients In conclusion oncedaily administration of doxazosin was considered a useful antihypertensive therapy for renal hypertension and hypertension associated with renal dysfunction
S238	The familial occurrence of atopy defined by skin prick test responses and serum immunoglobulinE IgE titres to common inhaled allergens was studied in 239 members of 40 nuclear and 3 extended families 90 of the atopic children in the nuclear families had at least one demonstrably atopic parent In each extended family atopy was vertically transmitted and 31 of 47 66 offspring of marriages between atopic and unaffected parents were atopic Of the designated atopic subjects 83 admitted to symptoms suggesting atopic disease but only 30 regarded themselves as having any such disorder It is suggested that atopy the propensity to produce IgE in response to common usually inhaled allergens is inherited as an autosomal dominant character but that its clinical expression depends on interaction with other factors
S239	We have isolated bovine and human adrenal cDNA clones encoding the adrenal cytochrome P450 specific for 11 betahydroxylation P450c11 A bovine adrenal cDNA library constructed in the bacteriophage lambda vector gt10 was probed with a previously isolated cDNA clone corresponding to part of the 3 untranslated region of the 42kilobase kb mRNA encoding P450c11 Several clones with 32kb cDNA inserts were isolated Sequence analysis showed that they overlapped the original probe by 300 base pairs bp Combined cDNA and RNA sequence data demonstrated a continuous open reading frame of 1509 bases P450c11 is predicted to contain 479 amino acid residues in the mature protein in addition to a 24residue aminoterminal mitochondrial signal sequence A bovine clone was used to isolate a homologous clone with a 35kb insert from a human adrenal cDNA library A region of 1100 bp was 81 homologous to 769 bp of the coding sequence of the bovine cDNA except for a 400bp segment presumed to be an unprocessed intron Hybridization of the human cDNA to DNA from a panel of humanrodent somatic cell hybrid lines and in situ hybridization to metaphase spreads of human chromosomes localized the gene to the middle of the long arm of chromosome 8 These data should be useful in developing reagents for heterozygote detection and prenatal diagnosis of 11 betahydroxylase deficiency the second most frequent cause of congenital adrenal hyperplasia
S240	OBJECTIVETo determine the relevant dose of bendrofluazide for treating mild to moderate hypertension DESIGNDouble blind parallel group trial of patients who were given placebo for six weeks and then randomly allocated to various doses of bendrofluazide 125 25 5 or 10 mg daily or placebo for 12 weeks SETTINGGeneral practices in Zealand Denmark PATIENTS257 Patients with newly diagnosed or previously treated hypertension aged 2570 who had a mean diastolic blood pressure of 100120 mm Hg after receiving placebo for six weeks MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESReduction in diastolic blood pressure and changes in biochemical variables potassium urate glucose fructosamine total cholesterol apolipoprotein A I apolipoprotein B and triglyceride concentrations RESULTSAll doses of bendrofluazide significantly reduced diastolic blood pressure to the same degree 1011 mm Hg Clear relations between dose and effect were shown for potassium urate glucose total cholesterol and apolipoprotein B concentrations The 125 mg dose increased only urate concentrations whereas the 10 mg dose affected all the above biochemical variables CONCLUSIONThe relevant range of doses of bendrofluazide to treat mild to moderate hypertension is 12525 mg a day Higher doses caused more pronounced adverse biochemical effects including adverse lipid effects Previous trials with bendrofluazide have used too high doses
S241	The radiographic examination plays an extremely important role in the diagnosis of appendicular arthropathies Accurate diagnosis can be made by observing the radiographic abnormalities in the bones surrounding the joint involved and the distribution of the abnormalities within the joint or the body
S242	Because of anatomic limitations at the EG junction in total and subtotal gastric resections gastrointestinal reconstruction is technically challenging In stapled anastomosis suboptimal application of a pursestring suture to the distal esophagus may lead to anastomotic breakdown We describe herein a technique in which this step is eliminated to achieve a sound full thickness anastomosis with the use of the Roticulator TA 30 and the EEA Premium stapling instruments
S243	To evaluate the prevalence of von Willebrands disease vWd we carried out an epidemiological investigation among school children of the Veneto region in northern Italy A total of 1218 of 1281 possible children participated in the study They were 11 to 14 years of age and all attended secondary schools in two distinct small areas 70 km apart between which there is no social contact A blood sample was taken from each subject for determination of the blood group and von Willebrand factor vWf level measured as ristocetin cofactor and expressed in IUdL after calibration of the internal pool against an international standard and the parents were given a questionnaire concerning hemorrhagic symptoms in the members of the family in the last three generations Separate normal ranges were calculated for blood group O and nonO subjects 1166 children and 289 adults with a nonparametric method because the distribution curves of the reference values did not fit the gaussian distribution Diagnoses of vWd were considered only for children who had low vWf levels and were members of a family with a convincing bleeding history case of probable vWd A final diagnosis was assigned if in addition to these criteria at least one other family member on the side with hemorrhagic history had a low vWf level Of the 1218 children examined ten were classified as having vWd 082 Taking into account the 90 confidence interval for the lower limit of the normal range this figure could range from 7 057 to 14 115 All these subjects were mildly to moderately affected and presented features of heterozygous classic vWd type I Affected subjects were distributed evenly in the two areas examined Our results suggest that the prevalence of vWd might be much higher than previously reported and that a different screening approach might be of use for patients with mild bleeding diathesis
S244	The purpose of this study was to determine the interrepetition and interoccasion generalizability of grip strength measurements in patients with the diagnosis of proximal extensor carpi radialis brevis tendinitis Thirtyfive consecutive patients mean age  445  86 years mean duration of symptoms  39  35 months fulfilling the eligibility criteria participated in the study Measurements of painfree grip strength and maximum grip strength for the involved limb and maximum grip strength for the uninvolved limb were taken on two test dates within seven days of each other We calculated the variation between measurements within a test session and the variation from one session to the next using generalizability coefficients based on the mean of the six measurements The coefficients for interrepetition interoccasion and overall generalizability were 99 97 and 96 respectively The clinical implication of these findings is that the overall generalizability can best be enhanced by averaging grip strength measurements recorded from multiple test sessions rather than by increasing the number of repetitions during a single test session
S245	Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of the subclavian artery was performed in 35 patients In 50 of all dilations the angioplasty balloon was inflated across the origin of the vertebral artery No complications occurred All subclavian steals were corrected The relationship between the subclavian artery stenosis and the vertebral artery origin should be determined if the vertebral artery originates from a healthy segment of the subclavian artery or from a segment with poststenotic dilatation the angioplasty balloon can safely be distended across the vertebral artery origin
S246	The major objectives of water treatment of hydrotherapy pools are to disinfect the water and to balance the water appropriately A variety of disinfectant systems utilizing either halogens ozone or metals have been implemented in hydrotherapy pools Regardless of the disinfectant system employed continual and appropriate monitoring of the system is mandatory to prevent infection Water balancing refers to the control of the water mineral concentration so that the water does not damage the pool Five major factors that influence water balance are pH total alkalinity calcium hardness total dissolved solids and temperature The extent to which these five factors affect water balance can be computed by the Langelier saturation index
S247	To elucidate the pathogenesis of bronchospasm in congestive heart failure we studied 23 patients with chronic impairment of left ventricular function due to coronary artery disease or dilated cardiomyopathy In 21 of them we found marked bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine The mean dose  SD of methacholine that elicited a 20 percent decrease in the forced expiratory volume in one second FEV1 was 421  298 micrograms nearly the same as in patients with symptomatic asthma In contrast there was no bronchial response to methacholine in 9 of 10 patients who had coronary artery disease but normal left ventricular function Administration of the bronchodilator albuterol led to a partial 43 percent reversal of the methacholineinduced bronchial obstruction In 12 patients pretreatment with the alphaadrenergic agonist methoxamine 10 mg by inhalation a potent vasoconstrictor fully prevented the methacholineinduced decrease in FEV1 The protective effect of methoxamine was blocked by the alphaadrenergic antagonist phentolamine in all six patients who received this agent We conclude that bronchial hyperresponsiveness to cholinergic agonists is frequent in patients with impaired left ventricular function and may contribute to the wheezy dyspnea commonly observed in such patients The bronchoconstriction may be mediated at least in part by dilatation of the bronchial vessels
S248	Colony forming cells CFC with high proliferative potential have been detected in nutrient agar cultures of human bone marrow cells containing recombinant human interleukin3 IL3 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor GMCSF These CFC were detected by the formation of large colonies with diameters greater than 05 mm and containing approximately 50000 cells after 28 days incubation The incidence of these CFC was only two in 100000 normal bone marrow cells however bone marrow from patients treated with 5fluorouracil contained up to sevenfold higher numbers of these CFC The characteristics of these CFC multifactorresponsive progenitors with high proliferative potential requiring a prolonged growth period in culture and showing a relative preservation in marrow from individuals pretreated with 5fluorouracil are consistent with a human cell type equivalent to the primitive murine progenitor termed HPPCFC
S249	Single film exclusion arteriography is a simple technique for accurate evaluation of the vascular integrity of the extremity that has been traumatized which takes only minutes to perform The procedure can be used to detect or exclude a vascular injury when obvious clinical signs of vascular disruption are absent but the mechanism of injury is suspicious It also eliminates the delay and danger of formal angiography in select critically injured patients Single film exclusion arteriography is an important diagnostic tool which can accurately delineate the presence of vascular trauma necessitating operative repair
S250	The extensor digitorum brevis island flap is a versatile and robust flap able to provide adequate bulk and coverage in softtissue defects of the lower limb The donorsite deformity is limited to the necessary scar needed to approach and rotate the muscle An anatomic study was performed in 10 fresh cadavers and consisted of two parts study of the muscle flap itself and examination of skin vascularization Methylene blue and Salmons mass radiopaque were injected through the three main arteries of the leg Muscle and cutaneous staining were noted Clinical applications of this flap are reported These resulted in successful healing of the defect with good aesthetic and functional results on both recipient and donor sites Longterm followup was maintained for up to 21 months
S251	Over a 2 12year period 34 patients underwent therapeutic external ventricular drainage with a valveregulated system The mean duration of drainage was 16 days There was no incidence of ventricular infection nor was there blockage of the ventricular catheter requiring revision Eventually 13 patients required ventriculoperitoneal shunts All survivors remained free from complications after more than 6 months of followup The system proved safe and reliable in patients requiring prolonged ventricular drainage
S252	A patient was admitted to the hospital with multiple skin nodules of recent origin and signs and symptoms suggestive of acute pulmonary infection Because one of the skin masses was located overlying the left mandibular body region the patient was referred to the hospital dentistry clinic for evaluation Historical clinical and radiographic assessments were consistent with reactive lymphadenopathy and an intraoral excisional biopsy was performed The biopsy results were indicative of giant cell carcinoma which was confirmed by biopsy results from a similar skin lesion on the shoulder and by malignant cells recovered in the sputum and pleural fluids Although this carcinoma has been shown to rarely metastasize to the skin and lymphatics of the neck this is the first case report of metastasis to facial lymphatics
S253	Evaluation of idiosyncratic drug reactions in predisposed individuals is limited by ethical concerns arising from rechallenge with the suspected offending agent A previously developed in vitro method using human lymphocytes and a murine microsomal drug metabolizing system has been used to examine toxicity due to acetaminophen APAP sulfonamide antibiotics and aromatic anticonvulsants An improved method is described in which toxic APAP metabolites are generated by a purified and reconstituted cytochrome P450 system minimizing the amount of exogenous detoxification enzymes in the assay Toxicity is assessed by an objective automated method based on the reduction of 345dimethylthiazol2yl25diphenyl tetrazolium bromide to an insoluble purple formazan by the mitochondria of viable cells and correlates with that based on trypan blue exclusion Toxicity required cytochrome P450 and NADPH and was inhibited by SKF 525A Exogenous glutathione also decreased toxicity in a concentrationdependent manner Lymphocytes from a glutathione synthetasedeficient patient exhibited markedly enhanced toxicity to APAP exceeding the 95 CL of 10 control subjects over a concentration range of 10 to 1000 microgramsml The data are consistent with the generation of cytochrome P450dependent reactive metabolites which subsequently can be detoxified by glutathione This method allows one to address specifically individual differences in detoxification pathways The use of an automated assessment of cell viability may prove useful in preclinical screening of new compounds for their propensity to cause idiosyncratic drug reactions in a predisposed population
S254	Most studies show that oral ingestion of iron does not cause a positive stool guaiac reaction However all in vitro studies show that iron does cause a positive guaiac reaction and some in vivo studies have shown a positive stool guaiac reaction in response to oral iron This study examines this unresolved question Twentyfive normal volunteers were given 900 mg of ferrous sulfate a day Two Hemoccult II and two HemoQuant tests were obtained before and during iron therapy All Hemoccult II tests were negative before and after oral iron Four HemoQuant tests were slightly elevated before oral iron and one was slightly elevated after oral iron Ferrous sulfate 300 mg was dissolved in 1 L of water The solution was acidic pH  39 and produced a positive Hemoccult II test When the solution was titrated with sodium hydroxide to a pH of greater than or equal to 60 iron precipitated out and the mixture no longer produced a positive Hemoccult II reaction Our data show that ferric iron Fe3 in solution will give a positive guaiac reaction directly and ferrous iron Fe2 will give a positive guaiac reaction after hydrogen peroxide is added because it oxidizes Fe2 to Fe3 Iron solutions are acidic and when titrated toward a neutral pH the iron is precipitated out and the solution is then guaiacnegative Thus our in vivo data confirm most previous in vivo studies furthermore the discrepancy between in vivo and in vitro studies can be explained as a pHdependent phenomenon of in vitro iron solutions Oral iron should not cause a positive guaiac reaction and the HemoQuant results show no increase in occult blood loss in subjects on oral iron therapy
S255	The authors reviewed the computed tomography CT scans plain radiographs and subsequent treatment of 17 patients with complex proximal humeral fractures CT scans and radiographs were compared in the demonstration of fracture lines displacement of fracture fragments rotation of fragments relative to their normal positions and status of the head and articular surface of the humerus The impact of CT findings on the decision to treat with surgery versus closed reduction and on the choice of surgical procedure was assessed Surgery was not performed in nine patients because CT scans showed no significant displacement of fragments previously judged displaced or indeterminate on radiographs Surgery was performed in eight patients CT demonstrated significant abnormalities not definitely shown with radiography In six of these eight patients CT scans demonstrated unsuspected abnormalities that directed the choice of surgical procedure CT scans provide clinically useful information for the treatment of complex proximal humeral fractures when radiographs provide inadequate or indefinite information
S256	Depression is a serious condition that will be encountered by most nurses regardless of their specialty area or practice setting There is good empirical support for biologic and psychologic models of depression This article discusses how symptom management is enhanced through a combination of psychotherapeutic and somatic treatments
S257	Many of the perceived and actual difficulties in the creation of screening centers have been solved or are amenable to solution The amount of radiation delivered to the breast during mammography no longer poses a significant risk and there is ample evidence that screening mammography can detect occult disease While substantial evidence is lacking with respect to a decrease in mortality in patients under 50 years of age there is an unequivocal gain in those over 50 years of age Other concerns center around the number of trained radiologists available to interpret large numbers of screening mammograms the use of lay screeners to minimize the physician shortage and the availability of instruction centers to educate those radiologists not formally trained in mammography The question of quality control is closely tied to the training of the radiologist and must be addressed if screening centers are to function efficiently All of the above are correctable to a greater or lesser degree but the problem of cost remains To survey all women over 40 years of age at a cost of 5000 per examination would require an expenditure in excess of two billion dollars a year a staggering sum even in the context of the economy of the 1980s It is necessary that these costs be lowered if the full potential of a major cancer detection procedure is to be realized This conference has both the responsibility and opportunity to perform a significant service for the women of the US We ask all of you to devote your greatest ingenuity to achieving its major purpose the development of a practical strategy for cost reduction in mammography While it may not be possible to achieve all that we wish the formulation of any reasonable plan to increase public access will be a major accomplishment I remind you of a French aphorism The greatest crime is to do nothing because we fear we can only do a little
S258	Construction of the alar rim is an extremely challenging problem Utilizing supradefect nasal tissue as a hinged turndown flap combined with perinasal tissue mobilized as an inferiorlybased transposition flap allowed the formation of a thin and properly contoured rim configuration
S259	To find out whether the diagnosis of dementia agreed with findings at necropsy a detailed assessment of 27 elderly patients mean age 82 range 7094 presenting with dementia was conducted at a combined department of geriatric medicine and psychiatry for the elderly On the basis of the results the cause of the dementia was diagnosed clinically Neuropathological examinations were performed after death The clinical diagnosis made during life was not supported by the findings at necropsy in 11 cases Alzheimers disease was overdiagnosed in life 13 cases of which only six were confirmed at necropsy Although the clinical investigation was limited by availability of resources neither cranial computed tomography nor the Hachinski score helped to distinguish between multiinfarct dementia and Alzheimers disease in this age group This study confirms the value of neuropathological studies in the precise diagnosis of dementia
S260	The cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma associated with alpha 1antitrypsin deficiency has been exclusively reported with the PI Z allele We present a 63yrold white man with emphysema cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma The latter occurred on a background of diffusely distributed hepatocellular dysplasia Serum protein electrophoresis suggested a deficiency of alpha 1antitrypsin quantitated at 13 of normal PI phenotyping showed that he had only the rare PI Mmalton allele previously associated only with severe lung disease Family studies demonstrated the distribution of this rare allele The liver at autopsy displayed welldifferentiated hepatocellular carcinoma in addition to alpha 1antitrypsin deposits in normal dysplastic and malignant cells
S261	The possible advantages of breastconserving surgery over mastectomy with respect to psychosocial adjustment were assessed in an interview study Consecutive patients 40 to 80 years of age with invasive breast cancer of Stages I and II were eligible for the study Of 161 women 99 agreed to participate 37 received breastconserving treatment and 62 received a modified radical mastectomy The study method consisted of a semistructured interview at 4 and 13 months after primary treatment based on the Social Adjustment Scale SAS and two scales for the estimation of anxiety depression and adjustment to a sexual relationship The womens ratings in the SAS inventory for adjustment to work social life marriage sexual relationship and parental role showed no statistically significant differences between the two groups In the interviewers global rating in the SAS protocol of the overall adjustment after 13 months 220 of the women in the mastectomy group versus 54 of those with a preserved breast were rated as having significant disturbances A statistically nonsignificant tendency P greater than 005 emerged for the other ratings in the interviewers assessment in SAS and in the estimation of anxiety depression and adjustment to sexual relationships The consistent tendency indicates that there might be clinically important differences in the psychosocial adjustment after the two treatment methods Larger trials focused more sensitively on the problems after breast loss versus breast preservation in breast cancer surgery are needed to further explore this field
S262	From October 1986 to July 1990 we evaluated 22 patients with complex renal calculi in 25 kidneys for initial therapy using retrograde percutaneous nephrostolithotomy In 3 patients we could not attain renal access in a retrograde fashion In the remaining patients residual fragments after percutaneous nephrostolithotomy were treated with a combination of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy ESWL chemolysis and retrieval of small calculi with a flexible nephroscope Successful treatments were achieved in 6 of the 22 kidneys 27 using percutaneous nephrostolithotomy alone and in 17 77 using all modalities Retrograde and antegrade percutaneous nephrostolithotomy in conjunction with ESWL chemolysis and flexible nephroscopy in the treatment of patients with complex calculi yield comparable success rates However retrograde percutaneous nephrostolithotomy can be performed without the aid of an interventional radiologist and it provides easy access to the nondilated collecting system
S263	To determine the risk of active tuberculosis associated with human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection we prospectively studied 520 intravenous drug users enrolled in a methadonemaintenance program Tuberculin skin testing and testing for HIV antibody were performed in all subjects Fortynine of 217 HIVseropositive subjects 23 percent and 62 of 303 HIVseronegative subjects 20 percent had a positive response to skin testing with purified protein derivative PPD tuberculin before entry into the study The rates of conversion from a negative to a positive PPD test were similar for seropositive subjects 15 of 131 11 percent and seronegative subjects 26 of 202 13 percent who were retested during the followup period mean 22 months Active tuberculosis developed in eight of the HIVseropositive subjects 4 percent and none of the seronegative subjects during the study period P less than 0002 Seven of the eight cases of tuberculosis occurred in HIVseropositive subjects with a prior positive PPD test 79 cases per 100 personyears as compared with 03 case per 100 personyears among seropositive subjects without a prior positive PPD test rate ratio 240 P less than 00001 We conclude that although the prevalence and incidence of tuberculous infection were similar for both HIVseropositive and HIVseronegative intravenous drug users the risk of active tuberculosis was elevated only for seropositive subjects These data also suggest that in HIVinfected persons tuberculosis most often results from the reactivation of latent tuberculous infection our results lend support to recommendations for the aggressive use of chemoprophylaxis against tuberculosis in patients with HIV infection and a positive PPD test
S264	Mediumdepth chemical peeling of the skin is an intermediate procedure between superficial trichloroacetic acid application and deep phenolic cauterant application Combining solid carbon dioxide with trichloroacetic acid promotes both epidermal and dermal regeneration The technique for treatment of actinic degeneration acne scarring rhytids and pigmentary aberrations is presented
S265	The effects of anticoagulation thrombolytic therapy and augmented intracaval pressure on the risks of acute caval hemorrhage from Greenfield filter insertion have not been rigorously investigated To examine these risk factors the device was placed in three groups of five dogs Group 1 served as controls with filter placement only Groups 2 and 3 received anticoagulants before surgery Group 3 was additionally given a continuous infusion of tissue plasminogen activator begun immediately after filter insertion Animals were killed after a 6hour period of observation and measurement A second phase was carried out at autopsy in group 3 intracaval pressure was augmented and its effects on caval integrity noted During the period of observation there were no significant decrements in central venous pressure or hematocrit At autopsy no evidence of caval hemorrhage and no caval perforations were found Increased intracaval pressure did not alter these findings These results support the clinical experience with the device and suggest that the risk of acute hemorrhage from a properly seated filter is minimal even with concurrent use of heparin and thrombolytic agents or high caval pressures
S266	The pseudoautosomal boundary is defined by an Alu repeat element on the Y chromosome The Alu element is found on all Y chromosomes and on no X chromosomes establishing it as part of Yspecific sequences Distal to the Alu element sequences from the X and Y are strictly homologous suggesting that the boundary is formed by an abrupt break in sequence homology Further investigation of the function of the boundary has been undertaken by examining the population structure of an MspI restrictionsite polymorphism XY274 which is located 274 bp distal to the Alu insertion site Southern blot and polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrate fixation of the high allele noncutting or AT base pair of XY274 on the Y chromosome in most populations while a full range of high allele frequencies is found on the X chromosomes of different populations Two exceptions to fixation on the Y chromosome were found in African populations The level of linkage disequilibrium suggests that the first few hundred base pairs of the pseudoautosomal region on the Y chromosome share a single common origin more recent than the origin of the species
S267	Human prostate specimens from 25 patients provided 15 normal four benign prostatic hypertrophy BPH and seven adenocarcinoma samples which were studied using a polyclonal antibody against prostatic specific antigen PSA and protein Agold complex Our study showed the presence of gold particles in cytoplasmic vesicles and granules rough endoplasmic reticulum and occasional lysosomal dense bodies in columnar or cuboidal cells of acini from normal BPH and welldifferentiated cancerous specimens but not in the acinar basal cells Some moderately differentiated and most poorly differentiated tumors contained undifferentiated neoplastic cells in which PSA localizations often were associated with membranous structures since specific cytoplasmic organelles were not differentiated In prostatic stroma invasive cells which were of differentiated type localized gold particles In addition some neutrophils and macrophages also localized PSA suggesting their role in phagocytosis of extracellularly released PSA in the stroma of BPH and cancerous samples Thus far the authors have not observed neutrophils and macrophages with gold particles in normal prostate We suggest that neutrophils and macrophages were involved in transport of some extracellularly released PSA from the prostatic stroma or other metastatic sites to sera in BPH and cancer patients
S268	Diplomates of the American Board of Internal Medicine in hematology or medical oncology were surveyed about the content and setting of their practices adequacy of training for professional activities and preferences for certification The response rate was 60 N  2516 Approximately 20 of cases seen by diplomates in hematology involve nonhematopoietic neoplasms and 10 of cases managed by oncologists concern hematologic disorders Diplomates were satisfied with training in areas corresponding to their own fields of certification except for immune andor acquired immunodeficiency syndromerelated and nonneoplastic leukocyte disorders Training deficits most frequently recalled were office management skills and psychosocialcommunication skills Nearly half of the respondents preferred to maintain separate certificates Data indicate that the two fields are distinct However the overlap in practice brings into question the adequacy of training for diplomates who manage problems outside of their field of certification and suggests that some degree of crossfertilization in all training would be beneficial
S269	Oral and perioral lesions have been widely reported in homosexual males and intravenous drug abusers who are seropositive for the human immunodeficiency virus HIV or have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS Several case reports have also noted some AIDSassociated lesions among persons with hemophilia but the prevalence of these lesions in hemophilia populations is not known This study investigated the prevalence of oral and perioral lesions in a cohort of patients receiving care at a hemophilia treatment center In a sample of 32 patients with a factor VIII deficiency and 5 patients with a factor IX deficiency who underwent oral examinations more than 80 were HIV seropositive Cervical lymphadenopathy was present in more than half of the patients who were HIV seropositive but was absent in those who were HIV seronegative Intraoral AIDSassociated lesions were present only in patients for whom a diagnosis of AIDS had been made indicating that oral lesions among persons with hemophilia who are HIV seropositive may be less prevalent than among homosexual males or intravenous drug abusers who are HIV seropositive
S270	The cerebral haemodynamic effect of the kneechest position was evaluated in 15 anaesthetised patients undergoing elective lumbar disc surgery and divided into a control group n  8 where cerebral blood flow CBF was measured twice in the supine position and an experimental group n  7 where the first CBF was measured in the supine position and the second in the kneechest position CBF was measured by a modified intravenous 133xenon washout technique Mean global CBF did not change in control group 561 SD 92 versus 528 SD 108 units and was not significantly modified by the kneechest posture 518 SD 88 units versus 539 SD 74 units in the supine position The results indicate that mean global CBF in the kneechest position is not different from CBF in the supine position in healthy patients

S272	Budipine a new 44diphenylpiperidine derivative and placebo were administered three times daily to 31 patients with Parkinsons disease over a period of 12 weeks All patients in the two treatment groups received levodopa plus benserazide at an optimum and constant dose for at least 2 months before the start of the study and throughout the trial The additional administration of budipine daily dose 60 mg was excellently tolerated by 14 patients while 2 patients left the study because of mental confusion at an early stage of the trial The budipine group showed a 22 improvement on the Columbia Rating Scale median score Compared with the placebo group 4 improvement there was a highly significant difference P less than 001 onetailed test Of the three main symptoms of Parkinsons disease the best effect was seen on tremor and less pronounced effects on bradykinesia and rigidity Owing to its long halflife 31 h with little plasma level fluctuations budipine appears to be an effective agent in the treatment of Parkinsons disease
S273	The accumulation of 5 nM d3Hamphetamine d3HAMPH into rat brain synaptosomes was examined using physiological buffer conditions The accumulation of d3HAMPH into striatal synaptosomes was saturable of high affinity ouabainsensitive and temperaturedependent suggesting an active transport phenomenon EadeeHofstee analysis of striatal d3HAMPH transport AMT saturation isotherms indicated an apparent Km of 97 nM and a Vmax of 30 fmolmg tissuemin Lesion of the striatal dopaminergic innervation led to equivalent decreases of 3H dopamine DA transport and AMT indicating that AMT occurs in DA terminals Furthermore AMT was not evident in cerebral cortex a brain region with a paucity of DA terminals In competition studies AMT was stereospecific dAMPH IC50  60 nM was an 8fold more potent inhibitor of the transport than its Iisomer IC50  466 nM DAIC50  257 nM DA uptake blockers and substrates were found to be potent inhibitors of AMT GBR12909 IC50  5 nM methamphetamine IC50  48 nM methylphenidate IC50  53 nM and cocaine IC50  172 nM In contrast serotonin was relatively weak in inhibiting AMT IC50  79 microM There was a highly significant P less than 001 slope  12 linear correlation between the AMTinhibiting potencies of AMPH analogs and their potencies in stimulating locomotor activity in rodents AMT may be important in the low dose effects of AMPH such as increased locomotor activity in rodents and stimulant activity in man Differences between AMT and d3HAMPH sequestration described earlier as well as their possible relevance to behavioral and neurochemical sequelae of AMPH administration are also discussed
S274	With rapid intravenous infusion of very large volumes of isotonic saline solutions into the fetus the fluid could stay within the fetal body thereby creating hydrops fetalis be transferred into the amniotic fluid through the fetal kidneys thereby creating polyhydramnios or be transferred across the placenta into the maternal circulation This study was designed to explore these possibilities After a 1hour control period 10 nearterm chronically catheterized ovine fetuses were infused intravenously with 4 L greater than 100 of fetal weight of either isotonic saline solution or lactated Ringers solution over 4 hours Fetal arterial pressure was significantly elevated by 7 mm Hg throughout the infusion p less than 000001 Venous pressure underwent a transient rise 48 mm Hg at 20 minutes of infusion and remained elevated 27 mm Hg during the rest of the infusion p less than 000001 Fetal urine flow increased by an average of 57  04 mlmin throughout the infusion p less than 000001 and accounted for 341  26 of the infused volume Estimated fetal extracellular fluid volume increased by 177  18 of the infused volume Because fetal fluid retention urine flow and amniotic fluid volume changes accounted for only half of the infused fluid the remainder of the infused volume must have crossed the placenta and entered the maternal circulation Given the above changes in vascular pressures this requires a filtration coefficient of the placenta 50 to 100 times the previously reported values Thus we conclude that relatively small changes in fetal vascular pressures dramatically alter the filtration capacity of the ovine placenta and transplacental volume flow
S275	The model of the serum PRL surge generated in the ovariectomized rat after estradiol benzoate EB treatment was used to study the relationship between serum and pituitary PRL levels and pituitary PRL mRNA levels Adult ovariectomized rats were injected sc with 7 micrograms EB or vehicle at noon on day 0 Three days later day 3 the rats were decapitated every 4 h over a 24h period 0800 h on day 3 to 0400 h on day 4 for determination of serum and pituitary PRL and GH levels by RIA In addition PRL and GH mRNA content was determined using dot blot hybridization with cDNAs Administration of EB resulted in a significant rise in serum PRL levels at 1200 1600 and 2000 h on day 3 compared to control values At other times serum PRL levels in the EB group were the same as control values EB treatment also elicited a marked increase in pituitary PRL content at all time periods examined except during 1600 and 2000 h and after the PRL surge 2400 h on day 3 when there was a significant reduction in stored pituitary PRL The pituitary PRL mRNA content in the EBtreated group was significantly elevated 4 to 6fold over control levels throughout the study Furthermore PRL mRNA levels in EBtreated rats were significantly higher at 2000 and 2400 h on day 3 than at other time periods In contrast to its effects on PRL EB treatment had a slight inhibitory effect on pituitary GH content at 2000 and 2400 h on day 3 compared to control values otherwise this steroid had no effect on serum GH levels and pituitary GH mRNA content Interestingly serum GH levels and pituitary GH mRNA content in both treatment and control groups fluctuated in a pattern consistent with circadian rhythms with peak values occurring during the lightson hours These data show that estrogen has a stimulatory effect on pituitary content of PRL and its corresponding mRNA in the rat 3 days after injection These elevated PRL mRNa levels may be necessary for the occurrence of PRL surges Furthermore the facts that serum PRL levels were elevated only at certain times 12002000 h on day 3 while PRL mRNA content was increased at all times in the EBtreated rats suggest a differential regulation between PRL release and biosynthesis
S276	Arthroscopic debridement is a valuable alternative procedure in the management of osteoarthritis of the knee joint Although palliative in nature in many instances it yields permanent relief in the lowdemand knee of the elderly It is especially valuable in young individuals who have not yet reached the ideal age for reconstruction The procedure is a demanding one requiring considerable arthroscopic skills Sclerotic lesions synovitis loose bodies osteophytes chondromalacia and degenerative tears of menisci are encountered often in various combinations and must be addressed judiciously and completely The procedure simplifies rehabilitation and the riskbenefit ratio is very favorable
S277	Numerous investigators have reported the safety cost effectiveness and low morbidity and mortality of percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy PEG but not studies compare the results of gastroenterologists and surgeons performing PEG In a retrospective review of PEG performed at our institution morbidity and mortality were compared between these two groups The procedure was performed by either the surgical service n  49 or gastroenterology service n  51 One hundred PEGs were successfully placed in 92 patients Three placement failures occurred in the gastroenterology group Major complications were defined as conditions requiring operative intervention or resulting in death Minor complications using a defined list 13 different complications were those not serious or lifethreatening which were managed medically or resolved without treatment Twentynine minor 17 patients complications and 3 major 3 patients complications occurred in the gastroenterology group Thirteen minor 11 patients complications and 4 major 4 patients complications occurred in the surgery group Overall 30day mortality was 14 per cent 13 patients two of which were probably procedurerelated in the gastroenterology group In both groups there was no difference in the numbers of patients who had complications P greater than 005 The complication rate numbers of complicationsnumber of patients doubled in the gastroenterology group compared with the surgery group for minor P less than 004 and total complications minor and majorP less than 006 Since PEG is a procedure frequently performed by gastroenterologists it is imperative that surgeons particularly those not performing endoscopy be aware of the potential morbidity associated with PEG
S278	The performance status of the child with cancer is an important outcome consideration in pediatric oncology research and practice However no single measure for children has been available This is a report of the development and standardization of such a scale The playperformance scale for children is a parentrated instrument which records usual play activity as the index of performance Performance status ratings were obtained on three groups of children patients n  98 patients siblings n  29 and an independent sample of hospital employees children n  40 Children with all types and stages of childhood malignant neoplasms were represented Test results established the parent as a competent reliable rater and demonstrated the validity of the scale Interrater reliability was examined using correlational statistics and percentage agreement Agreement between parents was good and there were no systematic rater biases In addition parents ratings significantly discriminated differences in levels of functioning mean score patients 754 versus siblings 974 Correlational and analysis of variance ANOVA procedures demonstrated that the playperformance scale was significantly related to the global performance measures of experienced clinicians and was sensitive to change Inpatients received a mean score of 423 outpatients 907 and normals 982 These findings indicate that the scale is both feasible and effective It is concise can be administered repeatedly even to extremely ill patients and uses parents as observer reporters The playperformance scale for children provides quantifiable reproducible and meaningful data which is necessary for effective monitoring and management of the child with cancer
S279	We recommend that physicians distinguish shoulder arthritis from periarticular disorders A specific diagnosis should be made in the former if possible A number of arthritides have frequent shoulder involvement and they should be kept in mind Septic arthritis should always be suspected when there is acute pain and swelling Joint fluid aspiration should almost always be performed when fluid is present The diagnosis of gout or CPPD deposition disease usually requires crystal identification from joint fluid for diagnosis Treatment of shoulder arthritis with oral antiinflammatory medication is usually indicated appropriate treatment of the underlying disorder eg rheumatoid arthritis is necessary Physical therapy started early often combined with IA corticosteroids helps to maintain or improve shoulder motion
S280	Cold stress stimulates the release of both ACTH and TSH from the pituitary More striking changes in ACTH content have been seen in the intermediate lobe after cold stress Therefore this study was designed to test responses of individual anterior lobe corticotropes to cold exposure Male rats were exposed to either 30 min of cold 35 C 30 min of a novel temperate environment 24 C or were unstressed 24 C Pituitaries were fixed and embedded in preparation for immunolabeling for ACTH or TSHbeta at the light semithin sections and electron microscopic levels The semithin sections were used to measure areas of corticotropes and thyrotropes with Bioquant image analysis equipment Separate groups of pituitaries were dissociated and the cells were cultured for 2 or 15 h Then the cells were stimulated for 510 min with biotinylated analogs of corticotropinreleasing hormone bioCRH or arginine vasopressin bioAVP to detect the target cells cytochemically A third group of dissociated cells were fixed for immunolabeling for ACTH 16K fragment of proopiomelanocortin betaendorphin or TSHbeta Cold exposure resulted in a 14fold increase in the levels of serum ACTH over that of unstressed rats This was correlated with a 40 increase in the percentage of cells that contained 16K fragment and a 3040 increase in percentages of cells storing ACTH or betaendorphin Cold stress also increased the percentage of cells that bound bioCRH or bioAVP by 45 Analyses of semithin sections showed that areas of corticotropes increased by 21 following cold stress The number of rows of immunolabeled ACTH secretion granules also increased in corticotropes from coldstressed rats Exposure to a novel environment for 30 min resulted in no significant increase in serum ACTH over that of unstressed rats There was however a 20 increase in percentages of cells that stored 16K fragment betaendorphin or target cells that bound bioCRH However the corticotropes were not significantly larger Many of the cells exhibited reduced numbers of immunolabeled secretory granules Other corticotropes resembled those from coldstressed rats When TSH cells were studied their percentages increased from 8  3 to 158  4 and their areas increased by 22 following exposure to cold After exposure to a novel environment percentages of cells that stored TSHbeta increased to 11  2 however no changes in areas of TSH cells were measured These studies demonstrated that the anterior lobe corticotrope is clearly activated by exposure to both cold and novel environmentABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS
S281	A 9yearold girl with Down syndrome had bilateral congenital coloboma of the macula She was born after an uneventful pregnancy and the results of a Toxoplasma dye test were negative We concluded that the condition in this patient was a rare occurrence of Down syndrome with macular coloboma
S282	Isomyosin analyses by biochemical immunochemical and histochemical investigations have been carried out in five sheep following unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis and direct functional electrostimulation of the denervated cricoarytenoid posterior muscle Myosin light chains were identified by twodimensional gel electrophoresis Myosin heavy chains were analyzed by onedimensional SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Slow myosin heavy chain was identified by orthogonal peptide mapping and immunochemistry The stimulation effect at cellular level was determined using adenosine triphosphatase ATPase histochemistry A dramatic increase of the type 1 fiber area slow fatigueresistant fibers could be seen after many weeks of an increasing regime of lowfrequency direct electrical stimulation Biochemically the amount of slow myosin was always higher than in normal muscles Some muscles were transformed almost completely to the slow type At the time they were studied and with the methods employed the expression of embryonic isomyosin was not observed In conclusion after numerous weeks of maintained functional activity elicited by direct electrostimulation the denervated muscle regionally showed areas of hypertrophy or at least lack of atrophy of slow myofibers without major signs of muscle damage
S283	The coupling free energy between an allosteric ligand and a substrate delta Gax is an explicit measure of the nature as well as the magnitude of impact that an allosteric ligand has on the binding of the substrate ligand to the enzyme with positive values indicating inhibition and negative values indicating activation By measuring the variation with temperature of the coupling free energy between the allosteric ligand and the substrate it is possible to determine the enthalpic and entropic components that give rise to the coupling free energy We have performed this analysis on two different Ktype allosteric systems the allosteric inhibition of rat liver phosphofructokinase by MgATP and the allosteric activation of beef heart NADdependent isocitrate dehydrogenase by ADP In both cases the coupling free energy arises as the net result of opposing enthalpic and entropic components with the coupling enthalpy delta Hax favoring activation and the coupling entropy delta Sax favoring inhibition For phosphofructokinase at 25 degrees C the absolute value of T delta Sax is greater than the absolute value of delta Hax and net inhibition of rat liver phosphofructokinase by MgATP is realized For isocitrate dehydrogenase delta Hax dominates however the net activation is substantially mitigated by the magnitude of T delta Sax Hence the coupling entropy plays an important role in establishing both the nature and magnitude of the allosteric response We hypothesize that the negative coupling entropy arises from the particular constraint placed upon the internal dynamical properties of the enzyme by the simultaneous binding of both allosteric and substrate ligands
S284	Nervous system dysfunction and hearing loss are part of the clinical picture of hypothyroidism Several studies on visual evoked potential and two brainstem auditory evoked potential studies have shown abnormalities in this disease that are reversible with treatment It has been suggested that visual evoked potential and brainstem auditory evoked potential could be useful to evaluate the effects of hypothyroidism on the central nervous system and to monitor the response to treatment We recorded brainstem auditory evoked potentials in 15 adult hypothyroid patients immediately before treatment All patients were women ranging in age from 34 to 82 years Fourteen also had an audiometric study In five patients both tests were repeated 20 to 22 months after treatment Audiometry showed that hearing loss increased with age suggesting that hearing loss in these patients could be secondary more to aging than to hypothyroidism When compared to sexmatched controls of similar ages our patients showed no statistically significant differences in brainstem auditory evoked potentials before treatment Brainstem auditory evoked potential values were not modified in the five patients whose tests were repeated after treatment The normality of these results raises serious objections to the clinical use of brainstem auditory evoked potential for central nervous system evaluation and therapy monitoring in adult hypothyroidism
S285	The effect of a commercially available pulsatile slowinfusion system on the degree of infusate mixing and distribution was assessed in a lifesize glass model of the hepatic arterial system The authors determined both visually and quantitatively the mixing homogeneity of a lowflow infusion 14 mLmin of red dye through a sidehole catheter 25 F outer diameter into pulsatile flow 300 mLmin of a fluid with the same viscosity as blood When comparing nonpulsed versus pulsed infusion techniques the authors found that the pulsatile infusion system did not significantly improve the inhomogeneity of dye distribution in the 16 hepatic arterial branches The results of this in vitro study suggest that a pulsatile infusion system that uses low pulse velocities without regard for cardiac cycle is less than optimal and does not significantly improve drug mixing at the standard slow infusion rates Moreover as potential new intraarterial delivery systems are developed to improve drug mixing in vitro models may be the most useful means of initially evaluating their efficacy
S286	A costbenefit analysis of the impact of cisplatinbased combination chemotherapy for treatment of disseminated testicular cancer showed that the annual estimated economic value of this treatment innovation in the United States is approximately 150 million The estimate was based on the human capital approach which conservatively values a human life in terms of economic productivity Because testicular cancer predominantly strikes young adult males the savings reported were due to the future earning potential of the survivors A comparison of relevant National Cancer Institute NCI costs for drug development and clinical trials versus annual savings realized indicated that the total costs over a 17year period are recovered in less than 1 year This report is an example of health care cost savings resulting from NCI support of biomedical research
S287	Urokinasetype plasminogen activator uPA is produced and secreted by cultured human keratinocytes as a single chain precursor UPA in keratinocyte conditioned medium is not susceptible to inhibition with diisopropylfluorophosphate DFP and it has an apparent molecular weight of 55 kD under both reducing and nonreducing conditions Cleavage of keratinocyte uPA by plasmin results in the formation of a 96 kD complex comprised of activated uPA and PA inhibitor 2 PA extracted from normal human epidermis is only partially inhibited by DFP suggesting that precursor uPA is also present in vivo The synthesis of uPA as a precursor with reduced enzymatic activity as well as decreased affinity for inhibitors is likely to be a mechanism by which normal epidermis regulates plasminogen activation in vivo
S288	To assess the longterm efficacy of patellar resurfacing 100 knees were evaluated in 84 patients The operations were performed between 1978 and 1982 The followup period ranged from 60 to 103 months The diagnosis was degenerative joint disease DJD in 83 rheumatoid arthritis in 12 and miscellaneous in 5 of the knees The implant 47 knees and nonimplant 53 knees groups were comparable with respect to age body size and length of followup period The analysis revealed equivocal results Considering all diagnostic categories combined rest pain was marginally better in the resurfaced group p  004 but this difference resulted from an unequal distribution of subjects between mild and zero pain categories Pain with walking maximum walking distance ability to climb stairs and rise from a chair active arc of motion extensor lag and quadriceps strength were similar in the two groups When the DJD group was considered separately no significant difference emerged There was little evidence to support a recommendation for routine patellar resurfacing in total knee arthroplasty
S289	To evaluate the usefulness of multiple measures from rest and exercise radionuclide angiography RNA in predicting cardiovascular death and cardiovascular events death or nonfatal myocardial infarction and to assess the prognostic usefulness of the RNA relative to clinical and catheterization data we studied 571 stable patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease who had upright restexercise firstpass RNA within 3 months of catheterization and were medically treated With a median followup of 54 years 90 patients have died from cardiovascular causes and 147 patients have either died or suffered a nonfatal myocardial infarction Using the Cox regression model and a preselected group of RNA variables the most important RNA predictor of mortality was exercise ejection fraction chi 2  81 p less than 000001 Neither rest ejection fraction nor the change in ejection fraction from rest to exercise contributed additional predictive information Two other RNA study variables the change in heart rate from rest to exercise and rest enddiastolic volume index did contribute additional prognostic information to the exercise ejection fraction chi 2  23 p less than 00001 Compared with noninvasive clinical data history physical examination electrocardiogram and chest radiograph RNA variables were considerably more predictive of mortality chi 2  71 clinical variables versus chi 2  104 RNA Remarkably the strength of the relation of RNA variables with mortality was equivalent to that of the set of catheterization variables previously demonstrated in our large angiographic population to be prognostically important chi 2  104 RNA versus chi 2  102 catheterization variables The RNA contained 84 of the information provided by clinical and catheterization descriptors combined Furthermore the RNA contributed significant additional prognostic information to the clinical and catheterization data chi 2  136 p  00035 For cardiovascular events the relative prognostic usefulness of the RNA was similar although relations with this outcome were generally weaker Descriptors from the restexercise RNA exhibit a powerful relation with longterm outcomes and can be useful in defining risk even when clinical and catheterization data are available
S290	Contractility of tracheal smooth muscle strips and spiral strips of fourth to fifth generation bronchi was studied in organ baths The relationship among contractility airway smooth muscle myosin and smooth muscle thickness was also examined The trachea was divided into three segments each consisting of 1214 rings Smooth muscle strips from each of the three regions top middle and bottom of the trachea and from fourth to fifth generation bronchi were studied Acetylcholine ACh sensitivity log EC50 was 81 71 79 and 61 for the top middle and bottom of the trachea and the bronchi respectively At P  001 the EC50 ACh value of the top of the trachea differed from the EC50 value of the bronchi Maximal tension Tmax generated in bronchi 32 g was lower P less than 001 than in the top 104 g middle 71 g and bottom of the trachea 51 g Differences between trachea and bronchi disappeared when Tmax was corrected for smooth muscle myosin content Thickness of smooth muscle in bronchi was less P less than 001 than in the three regions of trachea Tmax was significantly correlated with airway smooth muscle thickness r  056 P less than 005 These results suggest that in mongrel dogs sensitivity to ACh shows a gradient from the top of the trachea to the bronchi and that Tmax is greater in the trachea than in the bronchi and is significantly correlated with thickness of smooth muscle
S291	Two hundred and twentythree patients treated by cobalt plaque for uveal melanoma were compared with 416 patients treated by enucleation for uveal melanoma in terms of patient survival The median followup time for the patients treated by cobalt plaque was 43 years KaplanMeier survival curves were calculated up to five years following treatment based on time to tumourrelated deaths Coxs proportional hazards multivariate analysis was performed to determine which variables were related to melanomarelated deaths while controlling for age size and location of the tumours Statistically significant predictive factors were location of tumour and largest tumour dimension There was not a statistically significant difference in survival between patients treated by cobalt plaque and those treated by enucleation
S292	Agents used to treat rheumatoid arthritis were examined for their ability to modify synovial fluid phospholipase A2 SFPLA2 activity Nonsteroidal or steroidal antiinflammatory drugs and disease modifying agents exhibited little or no PLA2 modulatory activity The exceptions include weak inhibition displayed by the cyclooxygenase inhibitors indomethacin IC50  1448 microM and sulindac sulfide 302 microM and a 5lipoxygenase translocation inhibitor MK886 IC50  50 microM Cyclosporine potentiated acylhydrolysis EC50  15 microM whereas the other immunomodulators examined demonstrated no significant effect on SFPLA2 activity Our data show that there are no selective PLA2 inhibitors currently used in the treatment of human arthritic disease and the viability of this novel approach remains to be tested
S293	We tested a 20gauge 2 12inch spinal needle and a 13gauge 3 12inch bone marrow needle with Ringers lactate delivered by gravity and 300 mm Hg pressure in vitro and in hypovolemic puppies to ascertain in vivo intraosseous flow rates and to determine the effects of catheter size and anatomic factors on flow rate In vitro flow was significantly faster than in vivo flow P  001 In vivo mean flow rates were 11 mLmin for the 20gauge needle and 13 mLmin for the 13gauge needle by gravity The mean flows by 300 mm Hg pressure for the same needles were 24 mLmin and 29 mLmin While the in vivo flow rates were significantly greater for the 13gauge versus the 20gauge needle the differences were not clinically significant 2 mLmin difference by gravity and 5 mLmin difference by pressure The clinically comparable in vivo rates for the two needles tested indicated that the rates are dependent on flow through the bone marrow rather than the size of the needle The data suggest that while intraosseous infusion is a rapid technique for gaining vascular access the flow rates achieved may not be sufficient for the definitive treatment of severe hypovolemic or hemorrhagic shock alone
S294	This paper synthesizes some major findings coming from our laboratory over the last decade The data focuses on our search for mechanisms that might contribute to the elevated risk for alcoholism in sons of alcoholic fathers Consistent results corroborated by several additional groups indicate that the higher risk sons of alcoholics demonstrate less intense reactions to ethanol as measured by their subjective selfreports measures of body sway changes in several hormones after drinking and the intensity or persistence of ethanolrelated changes on two electrophysiological measures The potential implications of these results as they might relate to an enhanced vulnerability to alcoholism and some possible future research directions are discussed
S295	In a retrospective study we measured the incidence of internal malignancy in patients diagnosed as having Bowens disease in Northern Ireland between 1970 and 1983 Data on 157 patients were obtained from hospital notes death certificates the Northern Ireland Cancer Registry and the patients general practitioners There was a preponderance of females with Bowens disease with a female to male ratio of 281 The incidence of internal malignancy was significantly greater in patients with Bowens disease than that expected for the general population suggesting that these patients should be screened for occult malignancy Patients with multiple areas of Bowens disease did not appear to be more at risk of internal malignancy than those with a single lesion
S296	Several common pulmonary disorders characterized by mucus hypersecretion and airway obstruction may relate to increased levels of inhaled or endogenously generated oxidants O2 metabolites in the respiratory tract We found that O2 metabolites stimulated release of highmolecularweight glycoconjugates HMG by respiratory epithelial cells in vitro through a mechanism involving cyclooxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid Noncytolytic concentrations of chemically generated O2 metabolites purine  xanthine oxidase stimulated HMG release by cell and explant cultures of rodent airway epithelium an effect which is inhibitable by coaddition of specific O2 metabolite scavengers or inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism Addition of O2 metabolites to epithelial cells provoked production of PGF2a an effect also inhibitable by coaddition of O2 metabolite scavengers or inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism Finally addition of exogenous PGF2a to cell cultures stimulated HMG release We conclude that O2 metabolites increase release of respiratory HMG through a mechanism involving cyclooxygenase metabolism of arachidonic acid with production mainly of PGF2a This mechanism may be fundamental to the pathogenesis of a variety of lung diseases associated with hypersecretion of mucus andor other epithelial fluids as well as a basic cellular response to increased oxidants
S297	Risk factors for temporal changes in chronic respiratory disease mortality were evaluated from two studies conducted in Washington County Maryland The first examined the mortality of a private census population greater than 35000 whites enumerated in 1963 over two subsequent time periods by age sex and initial smoking status The second examined the 10yr mortality of a subset of the 1963 census 884 men who had undergone spirometry We observed a fall in ageadjusted mortality from all causes and from arteriosclerotic heart disease ASHD but an increase in COPD mortality However the increase in these chronic pulmonary deaths is essentially confined to persons who were smoking cigarettes at the beginning of the study period Furthermore while smokers showed an increased mortality risk for all causes the excess mortality risk did not fall uniformly across cigarette smokers It is a major observation of this study that allcause and cardiovascular as well as pulmonary mortality are significantly more often found among subjects with ventilatory impairment independent of smoking status Reasons for the association of ASHD mortality with impaired forced expiration are discussed Thus men at increased risk for three ASHD lung cancer COPD of the five leading causes of death three of eight for women may be identified by spirometry Perhaps it is time that this test was more generally applied
S298	This study reviews the progress of 56 consecutive patients with type IIa and IIb hyperlipoproteinemia following treatment with lovastatin Lovastatin a potent inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase has been shown to have a cholesterollowering effect in doses ranging from 10 to 80 mgd Thus far however no large study has been performed to show the effectiveness of lowdose lovastatin 20 mgd for more than a 6week duration Fiftysix patients with known coronary artery disease were prospectively studied with fasting lipid values being measured at baseline and after 6 12 18 and 24 weeks of 20mgd lovastatin therapy given as a single evening dose The total cholesterol level fell 26 from a mean baseline of 812 mmolL 314 mgdL and triglyceride levels fell by 12 from a mean baseline of 246 mmolL The highdensity lipoprotein levels increased 76 One patient with known preexisting liver disease was withdrawn from the study owing to an asymptomatic significant rise in liver function test results one subject complaining of proximal muscle weakness was also withdrawn The maximal decrease in total cholesterol level occurred within 6 weeks of initiation of therapy We conclude that lowdose 20mgd lovastatin was effective in lowering serum cholesterol levels in patients with primary type IIa or IIb hyperlipoproteinemia with minimal shortterm side effects Further studies are needed to establish the longterm safety and effectiveness of this drug
S299	Unlike a CEO candidate who rarely turns a job offer down four out of five of the best physician candidates will turn down an offer from a hospital say physician recruiters Whether its a university hospital near the California coast or a community hospital in Nebraska hospitals make common mistakes when recruiting physicians
S300	The effects of age and food restriction upon the proteolytic capacity of the liver of SPF Fischer 344 rats have been investigated The proteolytic capacity of the perfused liver of ad libitum fed animals increased from 3 to 6 months of age and then declined linearly through 24 months of age Food restriction had no effect at 3 months of age 6 weeks of food restriction but by 6 months of age the proteolytic capacity was approximately 25 greater than that of the liver of ad libitum fed animals this increment was increased through 24 months of age Therefore food restriction while not preventing the agerelated decline in protein degradation did produce a greater proteolytic capacity at any age from 6 months on
S301	The types and performance characteristics of the present rules for acceptance and rejection of quantitative results by proficiency testing agencies are reviewed The rates of false acceptance and rejection by peer group evaluation are high when compared with explicit medical usefulness criteria Accuracybased target values and fixed limits provide the technologic basis for process control of interlaboratory accuracy and their efficacy contrasts with that of peer limits However uniform criteria for result accuracy are also required A clinical statistical model predicting the effect of method error on clinical diagnostic accuracy is proposed A criterion is proposed for result accuracy defined in terms of uniform clinical benefit The criterion specifies a fixed error limit for each type of application of a medical test that is appropriate for the inherent variability of the test application Recent College of American Pathologists Survey experience with clinical fixed limits for allowable analytic error calculated by the model is presented
S302	With the advent of noncemented total joint prostheses todays orthopedic surgeons are asking questions about the predictability and performance of newer biologically fixed implants Reported experience to date has failed to document any improved parameters of performance instead problems of prolonged convalescence postoperative pain and difficulties in revision procedures have been noted Other issues of concern relate to the potential harmful effects of ion leaching and problems of stress shielding and stress overload due to the physical properties of the materials presently available Current investigative efforts to resolve these problems look promising though surgeons should realize that science is a long way from producing the perfect total joint prosthesis
S303	A new technique is presented for funipuncture under ultrasound guidance using a biopsy guide and a 2025gauge needle combination The 20gauge needle was used for uterine entry and the 25gauge needle for the actual cord puncture The method was used for sampling fetal blood in 262 pregnancies with 264 fetuses two sets of twins between 1739 weeks at risk for betathalassemia chromosomal disorders TORCH infection fetal hypoxia and Rhisoimmunization Pure fetal blood was aspirated from 241 fetuses 913 including the twins The procedure lasted less than 5 minutes in 765 of the cases and less than 10 minutes in 901 of the cases Intraamniotic bleeding was seen in only 231 of the cases and fetal bradycardia was not noted Fortyfour pregnancies were terminated after the diagnosis of genetic or infectious disease Seven fetuses at risk for Rhisoimmunization found to be Rhpositive and anemic were transfused immediately after blood sampling using the same needle Of the 220 continuing pregnancies there were 14 fetal losses three before 28 weeks and 11 after 28 weeks or during the perinatal period A probable etiology for the loss was found in 11 cases These included one severely Rhisoimmunized hydropic fetus who died in utero after transfusion at 26 weeks one fetus who died in utero at 31 weeks following a car accident and nine malformed newborns The corrected rate for fetal losses probably related to the procedure was thus 09 before 28 weeks and 08 after 28 weeks This new funipuncture technique seems to have several advantages over the freehand andor biopsyguided singleneedle techniques
S304	Orthotopic liver transplantation is a clinical procedure that has been accepted widely as the treatment of choice for individuals with advanced chronic liver disease As such its application to the important clinical problem of alcoholic liver disease is inevitable The arguments for and against liver transplantation for individuals with advanced alcoholic liver disease are presented
S305	Antimycobacterial IgG levels were measured repeatedly during treatment in 12 patients with moderate or severe pulmonary tuberculous disease using a dot immunobinding assay We used reflectance densitometry equipment to quantify the immunoperoxidase staining and a Mycobacterium bovis BCG culture filtrate and the purified P32 protein as antigens Antibody response against whole culture filtrate and P32 antigen increased after a threemonth period of treatment After this antibiotherapy was completed the estimated amount of antibodies directed against the P32 decreased while those against the whole culture filtrate remained at the same level A serologic test using P32 as the antigen seems to allow a better discrimination between active and healed tuberculosis
S306	A potential association between abnormal electromyographic activitythat is decelerating bursts and complex repetitive dischargesof the urethral sphincter and difficulty in voiding was examined in 57 women with urinary retention Abnormal electromyographic activity was found in 33 Ultrasonography of the ovaries in 22 of the 33 women showed that 14 had polycystic ovaries Of the other eight women two had had oophorectomies one had shrunken ovaries and ovarian failure and one had previously undergone oophorectomy and the other ovary could not be seen in one neither ovary could be seen and three had ovaries of normal appearance although two of these women were taking the contraceptive pill Thirteen of the group had endocrine symptoms and signs characteristic of the polycystic ovary syndrome Videocystometrography in 17 of the women who were examined by ultrasonography showed low flow rates and high residual volumes of urine after micturition in 12 women who could void the other five having chronic urinary retention A speculative hypothesis for the observed association of impaired voiding abnormal electromyographic activity of the urinary sphincter and polycystic ovaries is advanced based on the relative progesterone deficiency that characterises the polycystic ovary syndrome Progesterone stabilises membranes and its depletion might permit ephaptic transmission of impulses between muscle fibres in the muscle of the urethral sphincter giving rise to the abnormal electromyographic activity This may impair relaxation of the sphincter resulting in low flow rates of urine incomplete emptying of the bladder and finally urinary retention
S307	The effect of intradermal injection of leukotriene B4 alone and in combination with prostaglandin D2 and E2 and the effect of inhaled leukotriene B4 in combination with prostaglandin D2 were studied in six nonasthmatic men The intradermal injection of leukotriene B4 1 microgram alone caused no immediate or late response in five of the six subjects but greatly potentiated the flare response to intradermal prostaglandin D2 05 microgram and E2 05 microgram in all subjects In contrast inhaled prostaglandin D2 6 micrograms alone and in combination with inhaled leukotriene B4 12 micrograms caused no change in the response to inhaled histamine measured 30 minutes and three and six hours after the inhalation These findings provide no support for the suggestion that leukotriene B4 has an important role in causing bronchial hyperresponsiveness The possibility that higher doses of inhaled leukotriene B4 may alter bronchial responsiveness cannot however be ruled out
S308	Continuous arteriovenous hemofiltration CAVH is an extracorporeal treatment in which fluid electrolytes and low and middle molecular weight solutes are removed from the blood by ultrafiltration It is efficacious in the management of acute or chronic renal failure complicated by fluid overload and following surgery In this study cardiac filling pressures cardiac indices and BP were monitored in nine patients A mean of 7 kg of fluid was removed in ten treatments without the induction of hypotension In nine of ten treatments cardiac index increased following fluid removal An increment in myocardial pump function was noted even in patients with low output heart failure This treatment differs from dialysis in its ability to remove large fluid volumes without compromising cardiac hemodynamics In addition CAVH may have a role in treating volume overload patients with renal insufficiency and heart failure resistant to pharmacologic intervention
S309	This issue of Selections focuses on studies of cholesterol reduction in asymptomatic adults Treatment of persons with coronary heart disease involves other issues and the need to consider additional evidence from other studies Elevated blood cholesterol levels are associated with increased coronary heart disease in young adults The real question is whether or not lowering cholesterol levels with diet and drugs is possible and if possible whether it reduces the risk of morbidity and mortality Even if the relative risk can be reduced it is necessary to consider the absolute risk reduction Reduction of the risk of fatal myocardial infarction from 20 to 16 over a seven year period while at the same time increasing the risk for gallbladder surgery from 13 to 19 may not be an attractive gamble There is little evidence that elevated cholesterol levels are a risk factor in adults over the age of 60 years Intervention trials have not been conducted in women or in the aged and overall mortality has not been reduced in any of the studies The Department of Health and Human Services of the United States recommends an approach that if implemented could have initial costs that exceed 10 billion dollars Yearly costs are likely to exceed the initial cost In a recent editorial Professor Joseph Herman expresses concern that the Israel Society for Research on Atherosclerosis and the European Atherosclerosis Society have adopted similar recommendations to those recently announced in the United States He also points to large variations reported from 5000 laboratories given standard samples to be tested for total cholesterol Currently blood cholesterol levels are available to shoppers at a supermarket in Florida New York Times 1989 January 3 The end of this controversy is not yet in sight
S310	We treated 19 men and 6 women less than 40 years old with bladder tumors The average patient age at diagnosis was 306 years and the mean followup was 65 months Gross hematuria was present in 84 per cent and excretory urography showed a mass in the bladder in 44 per cent of the patients Of 8 patients less than 30 years old 6 had papilloma and 2 had grade II to III stage O transitional cell carcinoma All patients with papillomas were free of disease The pathological reports of the patients more than 30 years old revealed papilloma or grade I stage O transitional cell carcinoma in 9 grade II to III stage O to A papillary transitional cell carcinoma in 6 and invasive disease in 2 1 of whom died Of the 9 patients with papilloma or grade I stage O disease 77 per cent are currently free of disease Of those with grade II to III stage O to B papillary transitional cell carcinoma only 1 is free of disease while 6 have had resectable recurrences One patient with grade II to III disease was lost to followup Accordingly all patients regardless of age should be treated as aggressively as necessary on the basis of the stage and grade of the tumor
S311	Radioligand receptor binding methods were used to characterize the alpha 1adrenergic receptor in the bladder body bladder base prostate and urethra of the male dog Saturation experiments were performed in tissue homogenates using 125iodineHeat an alpha 1adrenergic antagonist of high specific activity 2200 Ci per mmol The equilibrium dissociation constant Kd for 125iodineHeat binding in the bladder body 056 pM bladder base 081  011 pM prostate 086  019 pM and urethra 055 pM was similar suggesting homogeneity of alpha 1adrenergic binding sites in lower genitourinary tissues The receptor density in the bladder body bladder base prostate and urethra expressed as fmol per mg wet weight was 022  002 082  009 055  006 and 027  006 respectively mean  standard error of mean Competitive binding experiments with 125iodineHeat and unlabeled prazosin and clonidine confirmed the selectivity of Heat for alpha 1adrenergic binding sites Anatomical dissections have revealed that a major component of the smooth muscle of the bladder base and prostate originates from the ureter whereas a major component of the smooth muscle of the urethra originates from the bladder The measured alpha 1adrenergic receptor densities support these developmental theories
S312	betaendorphin adrenocorticotrophin and alphamelanocyte stimulating hormone were measured by radioimmunoassay in three areas of human brain at necropsy in seven subjects with WernickeKorsakoff syndrome and in 52 controls Thiamin concentration in six brain areas was also measured Mamillary body betaendorphin concentrations were significantly increased in those with the syndrome compared with controls and those controls with high alcohol intake showed increased mamillary body betaendorphin compared with controls with low alcohol intake Brain thiamin concentration was similar in both groups with the exception of the brainstem where it was reduced in subjects with WernickeKorsakoff syndrome Thalamic betaendorphin in controls was inversely correlated with thiamin in frontal white matter frontal cortex parietal white matter and parietal cortex while betaendorphin in the hypothalamus of patients was inversely correlated with thiamin in frontal cortex parietal white matter thalamus and brainstem These results suggest that there is a disturbance of the endorphinergic system in WernickeKorsakoff syndrome which may be related to alcohol intake
S313	A number of genetic disorders in humans are associated with defects in the synthesis and metabolism of collagen which are accompanied by multiple cardiovascular disease processes To determine whether genetically determined crosslinking abnormalities of collagen may alter cardiac function left ventricular papillary muscles of mice with a genetic defect in the crosslinking of collagen Movbr were studied in vitro With respect to controls increases in time to peak tension from 102  14 to 125  54 msec p less than 0001 and time to onehalf relaxation from 76  30 to 98  61 msec p less than 005 were measured Moreover resting tension at the length associated with maximum developed isometric force L was elevated from 111  17 to 193  11 mNmm2 p less than 0001 and a similar difference was also seen throughout the physiological range of muscle lengths In contrast developed tension was depressed at 9397 of L Peak rate of tension rise and decay were diminished whereas time to peak rate of tension rise was prolonged Isotonically a decrease in the magnitude of peak shortening at L from 40  05 to 20  02 p less than 004 and an increase in time to peak shortening from 100  23 to 129  28 msec p less than 0001 were seen In addition peak velocities of shortening and relengthening were diminished in the Movbr mouse heart In conclusion the impairment in collagen crosslinking alters cardiac mechanics by a reduction in forcegenerating ability and a prolongation of the timing parameters of the systolic and diastolic phases of contraction in vitro
S314	Plasma samples from some women with a variety of advanced gynecologic malignancies have been shown to neutralize exogenous heparin The purposes of this investigation were to determine the prevalence of neutralizing activity in a referral population of women with a gynecologic malignancy and to determine whether the level of neutralizing activity is related either to histology or stage or whether it is affected by treatment One hundred thirtyeight patients were studied over a 1year interval 121 had a documented malignancy 16 were healthy and one had a benign ovarian neoplasm The mean heparin neutralizing activity in the healthy patients was 45  7 and it was 462  26 in the group with malignancy p less than 00000 twotailed Seventyfive percent of all patients with malignancy had neutralizing activity greater than 25 The percent of staged untreated patients with neutralizing activity increased significantly with advancing stage from 59 with stage I to 85 with stages III and IV disease There was no significant relationship between neutralizing activity and histology site of origin or patient weight In 10 patients in whom the disease outcome was clear the change in neutralizing activity reflected or predicted the response to therapy We conclude that heparin neutralizing activity is a generalized phenomenon in women with one of the malignancies studied and it may potentially be useful in the evaluation of the patients response to therapy
S315	We reported previously that TPA facilitates the replication of human immunodeficiency virus HIV and has a selective lethal effect on HIVinfected cells by a cytopathic effect induced by HIV We have now studied the cytopathic effects of TPAtype tumor promoters teleocidin aplysiatoxin and TPA and the nonTPA type tumor promoters palytoxin and thapsigargin on MOLT4HIVHTLVIIIB cells All TPAtype and nonTPA type tumor promoters tested except palytoxin stimulated in HIV production three to sevenfold and caused more lysis of MOLT4HIVHTLVIIIB cells than of the parental MOLT4 cells Fifty percent of the MOLT4HIVHTLVIIIB cells were killed by teleocidin aplysiatoxin TPA and thapsigargin at concentrations of 20 20 10 and 10 ngml respectively and by palytoxin at the very low concentration of 20 pgml Moreover combinations of one TPAtype tumor promoter and one nonTPA type tumor promoterbut not the combination of two TPAtype tumor promotershad additive lethal effects supporting the idea that TPAtype and nonTPA type tumor promoters exert their cytolytic effects by different mechanisms These latter effects may be due to production of prostaglandin E2 which is commonly induced by both types of tumor promoters
S316	Glucose intolerance is often associated with pancreatitis Pancreatitisinduced diabetes represents a different clinical syndrome than type I and type II diabetes mellitus Patients with pancreatitisinduced diabetes may be extremely sensitive to exogenous insulin rarely develop ketoacidosis and rarely exhibit classic diabetic complications such as retinopathy nephropathy or accelerated vasculopathy Pancreatic polypeptide PP deficiency has been implicated in the defect of glucose homeostasis found after pancreatitis This study evaluated intravenous and oral glucose tolerance and insulin response to glucose loading in the setting of pancreatitis with and without shortterm PP replacement Dogs n  7 underwent pancreatic duct ligation PDL and were studied with and without PP infusion 2 microgramskghr before PDL and at 1 week 6 weeks and 4 months after PDL by means of intravenous and oral glucose tolerance tests Basal and bombesinstimulated PP levels at 4 months after PDL were subnormal verifying PP deficiency in these animals with pancreatitis PP levels during PP infusion reproduced normal postcibal levels averaging 897  40 pgml Glucose tolerance expressed as the glucose decay constant for the intravenous glucose tolerance tests and as the integrated glucose response for the oral glucose tolerance tests deteriorated over time and was not improved by acute PP replacement The integrated insulin response to glucose was not affected by PP The acute infusion of PP at a dose that reproduces normal postprandial PP levels fails to improve glucose tolerance or augment insulin release in this model of pancreatitisinduced diabetes
S317	Our previous observation on immune modulation induced by a given factor VIII F VIII concentrate preparation was extended by showing that the immunemodulating capacity is a more general feature of F VIII products and is independent of product purity Interaction of human monocytes with therapeutic concentrations of various F VIII concentrates 02 to 2 IU F VIIImL six different F VIII concentrates from four manufacturers led to a significant reduction in the expression of IgG Fc receptors in the membrane of these cells F VIII concentrateinduced downmodulation of the receptor This Fc receptor downmodulation was achieved by a short 1hour incubation of human monocytes with F VIII concentrates 16 hours prior to the Fc receptor assay and did not correlate with the respective products IgG content Although the IgG concentrations of the different products varied greatly from 10 to 1773 mg1000 IU F VIII all products behaved comparably with respect to Fc receptor downmodulation F VIIItreated monocytes 34  7 to 44  4 rosetteforming cells controls in the absence of F VIII 83  5 Furthermore we also were able to demonstrate that heat treatment of F VIII now used by virtually every manufacturer to eliminate contaminating viruses had no effect on the respective products Fc receptormodulating capacity The immunemodulating component was characterized as being a highmolecularrange compound containing IgG IgM F VIII and blood group substances most likely a combination of immune complexes and immunoglobulin aggregates This compound is present in comparable amounts in both highpurity and intermediatepurity products and apparently copurifies with F VIII during the manufacturing process
S318	It is unclear whether patients should be tested for the presence of HIV antibody This test has taken upon itself a significance beyond a simple hemoglobin Extreme views on testing are prevalent both from the Centers for Disease Control which does not recommend routine testing to physicians advocating screening The prevalence of HIV virus in our population undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was investigated Eightytwo patients ranging in age from 772 years were screened There were seven positive results by both ELISA and Western Blot assays Four had no risk factors except for transfusion therapy before HIV screening Three were known homosexuals Only two of the HIV positive patients and three of the rest of the dialysis population had serologic markers for Hepatitis B infection This 9 prevalence was much higher than expected Although the data suggest that the risk to the health care worker is low current recommendations to treat all patients as if they may be HIV positive protect the hospital or dialysis facility but may be unworkable The health care workers attention is not focused because they do not differentiate between low and high risk patient groups Furthermore the number of patients who acquired the virus prior to routine screening is unknown Because most dialysis patients were alive and transfused during this time period they may have inadvertently acquired the virus If others share these findings the implications for control of this disease are frightening as the risk of transmission to patients sexual partners is not inconsequential I believe these findings support routine screening for HIV antibody
S319	Cardiopulmonary bypass is widely believed to be injurious to renal function The low incidence of renal dysfunction with modern techniques of bypass led us to reexamine this concept by monitoring urine output and creatinine clearance in 18 adult patients undergoing nonpulsatile hemodilution cardiopulmonary bypass for coronary artery bypass grafting 12 patients or valve procedures 6 patients Samples were taken before during mean duration of bypass 105  26 minutes  standard deviation and every two hours after bypass for 24 hours Urine output 42  377 mLh and creatinine clearance 57  404 mLmin were surprisingly low in the period before cardiopulmonary bypass all values normalized to a body surface area of 173 m2 Urine volumes rose to 305  1496 mLh and creatinine clearance to 252  1769 mLmin during bypass and decreased to stable values after eight hours in the postoperative unit urine output approximately 60 mLh and creatinine clearance approximately 75 mLmin Renal dysfunction did not develop in any patient Nine patients who required loop diuretics for low urine output 18 hours postoperatively had a sustained increase in both urine output and creatinine clearance lasting up to six hours We conclude the following modern techniques of cardiopulmonary bypass are not injurious to renal function urine output and creatinine clearance are decreased before cardiopulmonary bypass probably because of preoperative dehydration and loop diuretics in the postoperative period increase both urine output and creatinine clearance for as long as six hours after administration
S320	The pulsatility index of the fetal umbilical arteries was evaluated in 14 highrisk pregnant patients delivered by cesarean section between 30 and 35 weeks of gestation Transabdominal cord sampling by ultrasonic guidance was performed on 10 of these patients Umbilical arterial and venous blood was obtained in all patients from the doubly clamped cord at the time of cesarean section The blood samples were analyzed for respiratory gases acidbase balance and lactate concentrations A significant relationship was found between the pulsatility index and pH PCO2 and lactate concentrations measured on umbilical venous blood sampled in utero The pulsatility index also correlated with the same variables measured on venous and arterial blood sampled at cesarean section Umbilical venous blood obtained transabdominally had a significantly higher oxygen content than blood obtained at cesarean section No significant correlation was found between umbilical venous oxygen content obtained at transabdominal cord sampling and the pulsatility index At a pulsatility index greater than 15 lactate concentrations in umbilical venous blood increased sharply There would appear to be a curvilinear relationship between umbilical blood flow and these indices of fetal oxygenation such that moderate increases in pulsatility index were not associated with a significant increase in fetal lactate concentrations
S321	The observation that type III erythrocytes of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria PNH are susceptible to hemolysis initiated by activated cobra venom factor complexes CoFBb whereas normal erythrocytes are resistant implies that the PNH III cells are deficient in a membrane constituent that regulates this process To isolate the inhibitory factor from normal erythrocytes membrane proteins were first extracted with butanol and then subjected to sequential anion exchange hydroxylapatite and hydrophobic chromatography Analysis by SDSPAGE and silver stain of the inhibitory fractions showed a single band corresponding to a protein with an apparent Mr of 18 kD PNH erythrocytes were incubated with incremental concentrations of the radiolabeled protein and then washed In a dosedependent fashion the protein incorporated into the cell membrane and inhibited CoFBbinitiated lysis This protein inhibitor functioned by restricting the assembly of the membrane attack complex at the level of C7 and C8 incorporation By using a monospecific antibody to block the function of the inhibitor it was shown that normal erythrocytes are rendered susceptible to CoFBbinitiated hemolysis Analysis by Western blot of membrane proteins revealed that PNH III erythrocytes are deficient in the 18kD protein By virtue of its molecular weight and inhibitory activity the 18kD protein appears to be discrete from other previously described erythrocyte membrane proteins that regulate complement These studies also indicate that the susceptibility of PNH III erythrocytes to reactive lysis is causally related to a deficiency of the 18kD membrane inhibitor
S322	For 51 patients with rapid cycling affective disorder clinical and family history data indicated that the illness was phenotypically and genetically related to more typical forms of affective disorder was characterized by a bipolar course 100 and was more common in women 92 Manicdepressive cycles were separate from menstrual cycles At the time of onset of rapid cycling 73 of the patients were taking antidepressant drugs the continuation of rapid cycling was associated with antidepressant drug therapy in 51 of the patients Although most patients had been referred to a research ward because they were considered to be refractory to treatment 37 attained essentially complete remissions usually during treatment with lithium andor monoamine oxidase inhibitors
S323	The doseeffect relationship of mivacurium chloride on arterial blood pressure heart rate and plasma histamine was determined in 97 consenting ASA physical status III patients receiving nitrous oxideoxygenopiatebarbiturate anesthesia In the absence of surgical stimulation during steady state anesthetic conditions with controlled ventilation average maximum change in tachographcounted heart rate was 7 or less after 1015s injection of mivacurium at all doses from 003 to 030 mgkg Average peak change in mean arterial pressure measured via radial arterial catheter was 7 or less after all doses from 003 to 015 mgkg Transient 0245 min decreases in arterial blood pressure were noted after 1015s injection in some patients at 020 025 and 030 mgkg When they occurred these changes were usually accompanied by facial erythema lasting 25 min and were correlated with increases in plasma histamine level P less than 0001 Facial erythema decrease in blood pressure and elevation of histamine level were all accentuated by increasing the dose of mivacurium and by more rapid injection of the drug For example mean blood pressure decreased an average of 13 after injection of mivacurium 025 mgkg over 1015 s In contrast during administration over 30 and 60 s of this dose arterial pressure decreased 76 and 15 respectively P less than 0001 1015 s vs 60s injection Average peak histamine level which increased to 132 of control after administration of 025 mgkg over 1015 s did not change after injection over 60 sABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S324	Different molecular species of interleukin 1 IL 1 were examined for the spectrum of responses elicited in human endothelial cells HEC including synthesis of prostacyclin PGI2 tissuetype procoagulant activity PCA platelet activating factor PAF and plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI The IL 1 preparations utilized for the present study included a natural partially purified IL 1 a preparation purified to homogeneity with extensive homology with the derived aminoacid IL 1 beta pI7 sequence denominated 22K factor murine recombinant IL 1 alpha human recombinant IL 1 alpha pI5 and beta pI7 Natural partially purified IL 1 a mixture of alpha and beta species induced the entire spectrum of responses in HEC Production of PAI was elicited by all forms of IL 1 tested PGI2 and PCA were elicited by 22K factor and by human recombinant IL 1 beta and alpha but not by murine recombinant IL 1 alpha PAF synthesis was stimulated by murine and human recombinant IL 1 alpha but not by human recombinant IL 1 beta and 22K factor Thus the available different molecular forms of IL 1 elicit largely but not completely overlapping patterns of responses in HEC The IL 1 pathway of regulation of HEC functions might provide a basis for novel strategies in therapeutically oriented research on vessel wall disorders
S325	The p53 gene is a frequent target of mutation in a wide variety of human cancers Previously it was reported that conditional expression of wildtype p53 protein in a cell line GM4723 derived from a human glioblastoma multiform tumor had a negative effect on cell proliferation We have now investigated the effect that induction of wildtype p53 protein in this cell line has on the expression of the proliferatingcell nuclear antigen gene The proliferatingcell nuclear antigen gene encodes a nuclear protein that is an auxiliary factor of DNA polymerase delta and part of the DNA replication machinery of the cell We show that inhibition of cell cycle progression into Sphase after induction of wildtype p53 protein is accompanied by selective downregulation of proliferatingcell nuclear antigen mRNA and protein expression
S326	A limiting factor in using microporous capillary membrane oxygenators CMO for longterm extracorporeal lung support is leakage Application of heparincoated CMO requires additional examination because leakage is probably caused by the temperature conditions of the gas the blood and the circuit environment and the surface tension phenomenon at the micropores The authors designed a thermostatized box in which the temperature of flowing gas Tg and blood Tb and the interior temperature of the box Ti could be regulated independently Tb was adjusted to the animals body temperature and Tg was kept about 2 degrees C higher to prevent condensation of the evaporated fluid from the blood side through the micropores into the gas phase Ti was maintained between Tg and Tb The saturated outlet gas could therefore condense only outside the box This system was used during 5 days of venovenous bypass using a covalently heparinbonded Carmeda CMO Maxima Medtronic in four adult sheep No plasma leakage occurred the surface tension of condensate water remained constant and the gas exchange capacity of CMO was unchanged
S327	Tobacco mosaic virus TMV produces large quantities of RNA and protein on infection of plant cells This and other features attributable to its autonomous replication make TMV an attractive candidate for expression of foreign sequences in plants However previous attempts to construct expression vectors based on plant RNA viruses such as TMV have been unsuccessful in obtaining systemic and stable movement of foreign genes to uninoculated leaves in whole plants A hybrid viral RNA TB2 was constructed containing sequences from two tobamoviruses TMVU1 and odontoglossum ringspot virus Two bacterial sequences inserted independently into TB2 moved systemically in Nicotiana benthamiana although they differed in their stability on serial passage Systemic expression of the bacterial protein neomycin phosphotransferase was demonstrated Hybrid RNAs containing both TMVU1 and the inserted bacterial gene sequences were encapsidated by the odontoglossum ringspot virus coat protein facilitating their transmission and amplification on passaging to subsequent plants The vector TB2 provides a rapid means of expressing genes and gene variants in plants
S328	Ambulatory ECG recordings are routinely used to identify patients at increased risk of sudden cardiac death and to monitor changes in ventricular arrhythmias during antiarrhythmic drug therapy The arrhythmia frequency established during the initial baseline has previously been reported to change during a second placebo monitoring period in patients with nonlifethreatening ventricular arrhythmias but the extent to which this applies to patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia has not been examined To extend these observations to patients with potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmias we studied 53 patients enrolled in one of two investigational antiarrhythmic drug trials that introduced a second singleblind placebo period placebopulse an average of 16 months after successful arrhythmia suppression Thirtyeight of the 53 patients had runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia recorded during the initial baseline placebo I period with 63 averaging greater than or equal to 10 runs per day There was a marked reduction in the arrhythmia frequencies between the two placebo periods 55 for ventricular premature beats and 77 for pairs p less than 0001 respectively Of the 38 patients with nonsustained ventricular tachycardia there was a 72 reduction 892  531 vs 245  18 runs of VTday placebo I vs II p  00001 with 32 having total suppression of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia during the second placebo period The results of this trial extend our previous observations of longterm spontaneous changes in arrhythmia frequency to patients with symptomatic potentially lethal ventricular arrhythmia and support the recommendation for periodic reassessment of baseline arrhythmia frequency to determine the continued need for antiarrhythmic therapyABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S329	The subunit structure of C8 is unusual in that it consists of a disulfidelinked alphagammadimer and a noncovalently associated betachain To gain insight into the biosynthesis and assembly of C8 we examined its production by short term cultures of rat hepatocytes Synthesis was detected by functional assays as well as immunologically with antisera against C8 alphagamma or beta Control experiments showed that all three antisera were capable of precipitating C8 from rat serum When antiserum against C8 was used to analyze hepatocyte cell lysates precursor as well as mature forms of alphagamma and beta were detected Precursorproduct relationships were confirmed by pulsechase experiments which also revealed a significantly faster rate of synthesis for alphagamma Importantly no single chain form of alphagamma was detected in the intracellular pool Evidence that C8 is assembled before secretion was provided by analyzing cell lysates with antiserum specific for alphagamma or beta Precipitation of both subunits with either antiserum confirmed they were associated Parallel analyses of the extracellular pool revealed that alphagamma and beta remain associated in the media but that excess alphagamma is secreted as a consequence of a faster synthesis rate These results provide evidence for differential expression of alphagamma and beta and are consistent with the existence of different loci for these subunits Furthermore they indicate that association of alphagamma with beta is a presecretory event in normal C8 synthesis
S330	Currently the coronary angiogram remains the gold standard for the detection and quantification of coronary arterial disease Clinical assessment of the arteriogram is usually based simply on the relative percent narrowing of the column of angiographic dye However such analysis oversimplifies and is not accurate for evaluating the extent and severity of coronary artery atherosclerosis Recently a new generation of ultrasonic devices has become available for intraoperative evaluation of coronary arterial anatomy These high frequency echocardiographic transducers use 12 MHz probes The transducer is placed directly over the epicardium during open heart surgery to evaluate the coronary artery With this technique demonstration of coronary artery anatomy including wall and crosssectional lumen is available in vivo We have undertaken numerous validation studies in vitro and in vivo of animal and postmortem human heart preparations to show that this technique can be used to accurately measure luminal area luminal diameter and wall thickness Subsequently in patients intraoperatively the extent of atherosclerosis using luminal diameter to wall thickness LDWT ratios was compared with the routine angiographic evaluation of coronary arterial disease using percent stenosis measurements LDWT ratios from arterial segments with no visible angiographic disease but with angiographic lesions elsewhere in the same coronary artery showed marked variability The majority were in the range of LDWT ratios of those segments where high frequency echocardiography recording was made at the site of angiographic disease This indicates that in vivo atherosclerosis is more widespread than the angiogram predicts and underlies the difficulties of using percent stenosis angiographically to determine the extent and severity of coronary arterial disease In a second study we have demonstrated that there is marked variability and eccentricity in coronary plaque geometry luminal morphology and placement of the residual lumen with respect to the atherosclerotic plaque This eccentricity results in some relatively normal coronary wall at the site of maximum atherosclerosis theoretically preserving the ability to vasodilate and vasoconstrict Studies with high frequency echocardiography are underway to study the capability of arteries with atherosclerosis to vasodilate We have evaluated atherosclerotic remodeling of coronary arteries and found that remodeling occurs in an attempt by the artery to preserve its residual luminal size during encroachment on the lumen by the atherosclerotic plaque This is the first in vivo demonstration of this process in human coronary arteries Coronary arterial bypass grafts have been evaluated in animal models and at the time of intraoperative coronary anastomoses to evaluate the adequacy of graft anastomoses and compare vein grafts with internal mammary graftsABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS

S332	The NIH 3T3 mouse cell line is widely used as a recipient of DNA from tumors to demonstrate the presence of transforming oncogenes We show that these cells produce transformed foci spontaneously if kept in the confluent state for more than 10 days The formation of foci depends on the type and concentration of bovine serum used in the medium and passage history of the cells Cells maintained in continuous exponential multiplication in the subconfluent state by transfer every 23 days in medium with 10 calf serum failed to develop the capacity to produce foci in 2 calf serum but those transferred the same way in 2 calf serum or in 10 fetal bovine serum which is a less potent growth stimulant did develop that capacity to an increasing degree over time The number of transformed cells increased sharply with the time that a culture remained in the confluent state There are several morphological types and degrees of transformation which indicates that the underlying changes are varied and the process is progressive The results also suggest that transformation occurs in a fraction of an entire cell population that is undergoing a physiological adaptation to moderate constraints on its growth

S334	Recent advances in the culturing of pigment cells from human beings have made it possible to begin the transplantation of autologous melanocytes into areas of skin that are hypopigmented In a patient with piebaldism we were able to take pigment cells from a shave biopsy of the normally pigmented skin of the back expand the cells in culture and return them to an area devoid of pigment cells and get a perfect take To grow the cells in culture we used 12Otetradecanoylphorbol13acetate TPA as well as cholera toxin and isobutylmethyl xanthine At this time one can substitute basic fibroblast growth factor for TPA The procedure of using autologous pigment cell cultures opens the door for further advances in the treatment of patients who do not have melanocytes in certain areas of the skin as seen in patients with vitiligo or piebaldism or as a consequence of severe mechanical or thermal trauma
S335	We evaluated the importance of pH titratable acidity and specific chemical composition in acid aerosolinduced bronchoconstriction in 8 asthmatic subjects We administered aerosols of HCl and H2SO4 at pH 20 in an unbuffered state and buffered with glycine The buffered acids were given in order of increasing titratable acidity defined as the number of ml of 1 N NaOH required to neutralize 100 ml of acid solution to pH 70 Each set of buffered or unbuffered acid aerosols was given on a separate day and each aerosol was inhaled through a mouthpiece during 3 min of tidal breathing Bronchoconstriction was assessed by measurement of specific airway resistance SRaw before and after inhalation of each aerosol SRaw increased by more than 50 above baseline in 1 of 8 subjects after inhalation of unbuffered HCl and in no subjects after inhalation of unbuffered H2SO4 even at pH 20 In contrast SRaw increased by greater than 50 in all 8 subjects after inhalation of HCl and glycine at pH 20 and 7 of 8 subjects after inhalation of H2SO4 and glycine at pH 20 The mean titratable acidity required to increase SRaw by 50 above baseline was calculated for each challenge by linear interpolation these values for H2SO4 and glycine 51 ml of 1 N NaOH and HCl and glycine 22 ml of 1 N NaOH were slightly but significantly different p  001 and were considerably higher than the titratable acidity of the unbuffered acids at pH 2 10 ml of 1 N NaOHABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S336	PURPOSE Polymyositis and dermatomyositis are inflammatory muscular diseases of unknown cause Many interventions are available to treat patients with these conditions including corticosteroids immunosuppressive drugs plasmapheresis and total body irradiation However these therapies are not always effective and they may be associated with certain serious side effects An attempt was made to evaluate the efficacy of polyvalent intravenous immunoglobulin IVIG in patients with polymyositis or dermatomyositis refractory to traditional treatment PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty patients 16 women and 4 men mean age 43 16 SD years 14 with chronic refractory polymyositis and six with dermatomyositis received high doses of IVIG because of the failure of traditional treatments prednisone 19 methotrexate 10 azathioprine 6 cyclophosphamide 3 cyclosporine 3 chlorambucil 1 plasmapheresis 8 lymphopheresis 1 and total body irradiation 1 In one patient with positive results on picornavirus serologic testing IVIG was the first treatment choice IVIG therapy was given with prednisone in 15 patients with methotrexate in six patients and with plasmapheresis in one patient There were no changes in treatment in the 2 months before the introduction of IVIG therapy and no increases in dose during this treatment Preparations of polyvalent human intravenous gammaglobulins with increased intact immunoglobulin G were used Thirteen patients received 1 gkg daily for 2 days each month and seven patients received 04 gkg daily for 5 days each month The mean duration of treatment was 4 months RESULTS Clinical assessment which consisted of the measurement of proximal muscle power and biochemical studies were carried out before each treatment period Significant clinical improvement was noted in 15 of the 20 patients Mean muscle power estimated for the 20 patients before and after IVIG therapy was statistically significantly reduced p less than 001 Eighteen patients showed biochemical improvement and two patients with normal initial serum creatine kinase levels showed clinical improvement Mean creatine kinase levels for the 20 patients during IVIG therapy showed a statistically significant decrease from the first IVIG perfusions p less than 001 Side effects of IVIG therapy were noted in four patients however these effects were mild During IVIG therapy steroid doses were significantly reduced from the second or the third IVIG infusion p less than 005 CONCLUSION IVIG is an efficacious new therapy for polymyositis and dermatomyositis and should play a role in the treatment of these diseases replacing or reducing steroid and immunosuppressive medications
S337	Three healthy young male manual laborers developed painful unilateral scapulothoracic crepitus arising from the superomedial angle of the scapula There was a history of trauma in two of the patients Asymmetric prominence of the superomedial angle of the scapula was demonstrated by computed tomography CT scanning in two patients All three patients were successfully treated by resection of the superomedial angle of the scapula The resected tissue was histologically normal in each case Painful scapulothoracic crepitus arising from the superomedial angle of the scapula is associated with local trauma is best investigated with a CT scan and if unresponsive to prolonged conservative measures can be successfully treated by resection of the superomedial angle of the scapula
S338	The reason for the discrepancy between bile flow and biliary bile acid excretion during ursodeoxycholate infusion in rats is unknown We found that ursodeoxycholateglucuronide is formed during ursodeoxycholate infusion at higher doses Ursodeoxycholate infusion 1 to 3 mumolmin100 gm body weight for 90 min caused marked hypercholeresis and the previously reported discrepancy between bile flow and biliary bile acid excretion was observed when bile acid concentrations were measured by regular enzymatic methods However the appearance of ursodeoxycholateglucuronide was observed on thinlayer chromatography analysis and up to 30 of the ursodeoxycholate in bile was found to be glucuronidated when determined by the enzymatic method after betaglucuronidase treatment The choleretic activity of ursodeoxycholateglucuronide 252 microlitersmumol was about 3 times higher than that of ursodeoxycholate 89 microlitersmumol when infused at 025 mumolmin100 gm body weight and ursodeoxycholateglucuronide also stimulated higher biliary bicarbonate excretion than ursodeoxycholate These results indicate that the discrepancy between bile flow and biliary bile acid excretion caused by highdose infusion of ursodeoxycholate into rats can be explained by glucuronide conjugation of ursodeoxycholate that cannot be detected by the regular enzymatic method The glucuronidation of ursodeoxycholate might also be important in the ursodeoxycholateinduced increase in biliary bicarbonate excretion
S339	In this paper we present the consensus statement from a national conference on research priorities and methodologies for studying geriatric evaluation and management GEM programs These conclusions discussion points and recommendations resulted from discussions of plenary papers working group deliberations and a final session in which findings were synthesized by the conference cochairmen and presented to conference participants for final review Major conclusions included 1 The importance of linking geriatric evaluation with care management in future studies 2 The need for multicenter trials of inpatient units to establish efficacy 3 The importance of studying criteria for targeting GEM care on patients who are most likely to benefit 4 The need for further developmental studies of outpatient GEM clinics 5 The importance of assessing a range of outcomes including mortality patient function satisfaction caregiver burden and cost and 6 The need to define more carefully the nature of the intervention that is being studied to aid in comparing and extrapolating findings The following research priorities for GEMS were formulated based on the conference 1 Within the VA health care system a multisite randomized trial of inpatient GEM units should be initiated 2 Multisite studies of inpatient GEM units and consultation teams linked to outpatient care should be initiated in nonVA settings 3 Studies should identify the components of GEM that are most critical to outcome 4 Studies should explore efficacy of GEM in settings that have not been well studied to date such as nursing homes and 5 Studies are needed to test screening methods and targeting criteria for GEM in all settings
S340	From 1971 to 1984 at the University of Rochester Medical Center 23 adult patients underwent surgical treatment via an anterior approach for pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis Data from 21 patients with greater than 2year followup is presented in this report Surgical debridement via an anterior approach was performed in all 21 patients Bone grafting with iliac crest or rib strut was done in 19 patients Clinical followup averaged 4 years with a range of 2 years to 9 years 9 months No patient had a recurrence of osteomyelitis All patients with neurologic deficits recovered without functional motor or sensory deficits Of the 19 patients grafted 18 showed roentgenographic evidence of fusion and one went on to a pseudarthrosis The average increase in kyphosis at the infection site was 3 degrees In selected patients with pyogenic vertebral osteomyelitis requiring surgical treatment anterior debridement and primary bone grafting in conjunction with appropriate antibiotics is successful in treating the infection and promoting osseous fusion in a high percentage of cases
S341	Three stages of the filarial parasite Brugia malayi infective third stage larvae adult worms and microfilariae were analyzed for differences in their protein composition by twodimensional gel electrophoresis Comparison of protein profiles of the different stages showed both identical polypeptides reflecting common proteins and polypeptides specific for each stage Three polypeptides present only in infective stage larvae were seen at 72 kDa at an isoelectric point pI of 498 p72 30 kDa at pI 55 p30 and 22 kDa at pI 475 p22 p72 could be labeled chemically with 125I by either chloramine T or IODOGEN and biosynthetically with 3Hleucine and 35Smethionine during in vitro culture of live larvae thus p72 is most likely a surface protein of parasite origin The antigenic composition of these polypeptides was elucidated by immunoblot analysis Both p72 and p22 were recognized by hyperimmune rabbit sera to infective larvae sera from rabbits immunized with adult worms however did not recognize any of these Ag Sera from humans infected with the related Wuchereria bancrofti filaria recognized only p72 and not the other two polypeptides It therefore appears that p72 is a stagespecific but not genusspecific Ag that is immunogenic in the infected host p22 also appears to be stage specific and because it is not recognized by W bancroftiinfected sera it may be either a speciesspecific Ag or a poorly immunogenic molecule of the parasite With mAb raised to p72 p30 and p22 these proteins were shown to share several antigenic determinants when analyzed by immunoblotting The shared epitopes were present on numerous molecules with a wide range of apparent mw in each of the different parasite stages Thus despite the apparent larval stage specificity of these molecules themselves they must contain certain epitopes shared by molecules from other stages as well The identification of the p72 polypeptide as a molecule with epitopes exposed on the surface of infective larvae provides a candidate Ag for testing as a protective immunogen

S344	In studies that attempt to measure intracellular calcium  Ca2i in the intact heart with the calcium indicator indo 1AM a fundamental assumption is that the signals report changes in myocyte Ca2i We studied isolated perfused rabbit hearts loaded with the calcium probe indo 1AM and recorded surface fluorescence of the left ventricle during continuous excitation at 360 nm In cells containing indo 1 an increase in Ca2i is associated with an increase in fluorescence intensity at 400 nm a decrease in intensity at 500 nm and an increase in the 400500 nm ratio Beattobeat fluorescence transients were recorded from the surface of the heart coincident with contraction indicating that a component of the fluorescence signals is derived from beating myocytes To evaluate the potential contribution of endothelial cells we compared the response to increases in Ca2o or bradykinin 105 M In response to an increase of the Ca2 in the perfusate from 06 to 30 mM left ventricular developed pressure and dPdt increased with a simultaneous increase in the Ca2isensitive 400500 nm ratio Perfusion with the endothelial cell agonist bradykinin caused no change in left ventricular isovolumic peak systolic pressure or left ventricular dPdt whereas bradykinin evoked an immediate elevation in both the diastolic and systolic levels of the Ca2isensitive 400500 nm ratio In additional experiments with indo 1loaded isolated beating myocytes superfusion with bradykinin had no effect on either the fluorescence Ca2i transients or contractility In contrast superfusion of indo 1loaded cultured endothelial cells with bradykinin caused the elevation of Ca2i within seconds Fluorescence microscopy of unstained frozen tissue sections from indo 1loaded hearts also suggested the presence of more intense microvascular endothelial cell indo 1 fluorescence relative to that observed in myocytes These experiments provide evidence that a component of Ca2isensitive fluorescence of whole hearts loaded with indo 1 is contributed by nonmyocyte sources including endothelial cells These results also raise the caution that the abrupt rise of Ca2i that has been observed during the initial phase of ischemia in whole hearts loaded with indo 1 may be partly derived from endothelial cells rather than myocytes
S345	From 1987 to 1989 a hospitalbased casecontrol study of cancer of the tongue was conducted in Montevideo Uruguay as part of a large study to investigate a number of risk factors for cancer of the oral cavity pharynx and larynx The study involved interviews with 57 cases and 353 controls and was restricted to men Relative risks RR associated with tobacco smoking alcohol drinking and selected dietary items were obtained by unconditional logisticregression analysis Users of black tobacco had a RR fourfold higher than users of blond tobacco and heavy drinkers of alcohol had a RR of 116 Infrequent consumption of vegetables was associated with a significant RR of 53 and heavy drinkers of the local infusion mate had a RR of 25 It was concluded that black tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking were the strongest risk factors for cancer of the tongue in Uruguay Their effects combine according to a multiplicative model Also infrequent vegetable intake and mate ingestion contribute to the risk of cancer of the tongue
S346	Vincristine sulfate VCR was administered intravenously to rats at doses of 025 05 and 075 mgkg During the first week following VCR treatment extensor digitorum longus EDL muscle contraction strength and fiber electrophysiologic parameters were measured At all doses tested VCR strongly reduced twitch and tetanic tension EDL fiber resting membrane potential was affected in a dosedependent manner and membrane depolarization was associated with the loss of excitability Local membrane hyperpolarization by intracellular current application restored the capacity to produce action potential AP However to elicit APs with a normal rate of rise polarizing current had to be maintained for 35 minutes indicating that the removal of Na channel inactivation followed a slow kinetics Minor alterations in spontaneous synaptic transmission and in evoked transmission during highfrequency repetitive stimulation were seen only at the highest dose It is suggested that VCR impairs skeletal muscle function by affecting primarily the contractile apparatus whereas sarcolemmal alterations are evident at increased doses of the drug
S347	Removal of epithelium from mammalian tracheae has been shown to enhance responsiveness to a variety of contractile and relaxant agents One of the most dramatic shifts reported has been for guinea pig tracheal tissue denuded of epithelium and treated with substance P We investigated whether this shift in responsiveness was because of 1 removal of an epitheliumassociated enzyme neutral endopeptidase which degrades substance P and 2 loss of an epitheliumderived noncyclooxygenase relaxant factor Using a muscle bath preparation we performed concentrationresponse curves with substance P and acetylcholine on indomethacintreated tissues with and without intact epithelium and with and without pretreatment with the neutral endopeptidase inhibitor phosphoramidon Epithelium removal potentiated the mean agonist concentration calculated to causes 30 of the maximal contractile response by 148fold for substance P and by 7fold for acetylcholine Phosphoramidon potentiated the contractile response to substance P but not to acetylcholine by both the epitheliumintact and denuded tissues P less than 005 However the degree of enhancement by phosphoramidon was much greater in the intact tissues With phosphoramidon treatment therefore the difference in responsiveness to substance P between the intact and denuded tissues was reduced from 148fold to 18fold This effect of phosphoramidon suggests that the hyperresponsiveness to substance P of epitheliumdenuded airway tissue is largely because of removal of neutral endopeptidase Because all tissues were treated with indomethacin the leftward shifts in substance P and in acetylcholine responsiveness induced by epithelium removal further suggest that an epitheliumderived noncyclooxygenase factor other than neutral endopeptidase also modulates the contractile response to substance P and to acetylcholine
S348	The effects of analgesic thermoregulatory and endocrine functions of administering morphine sulphate 03 mg into the lateral cerebral ventricle via an Ommaya catheter were assessed in eight patients with cancer pain Satisfactory control of intractable pain was obtained in these patients without any change in other sensory modalities The delay in the onset of pain relief and the duration of analgesia ranged respectively from 20 to 40 min and from 12 to 16 h after drug injection In addition intraventricular administration of morphine caused a reduction in rectal temperature in these patients at an ambient temperature of 24 degrees C The hypothermia in response to the injection of morphine was due to cutaneous vasodilation and sweating There was no change in metabolism or in respiratory evaporative heat loss after morphine injection Further 10 to 20 min after intraventricular administration of morphine the blood levels of prolactin growth hormone and glucose were elevated in these patients The changes in temperature and endocrine levels lasted for 13 h In addition to the pain relief these sideeffects of morphine treatment were shortlasting and disappeared as the morphine treatment continued The results indicate that activation of opiate receptors in the brain produced pain relief hypothermia due to cutaneous vasodilation and sweating and increased blood levels of prolactin growth hormone and glucose in patients with cancer pain
S349	Thirtyone young women subjects performed four maximal and four submaximal elbow flexion efforts The strength of each effort was measured using make tests and a handheld dynamometer The variability of repeated maximal and submaximal tests was determined by calculating CVs for each subject Every subjects CV was greater during submaximal than during maximal trials Furthermore the mean CV was significantly greater during submaximal trials than during maximal trials No subject demonstrated a CV greater than 75 per cent for maximal trials but most had CVs greater than 75 per cent for submaximal trials The results suggest that for the subjects tested CVs greater than 75 per cent were consistent with feigned weakness Coefficients of variation above 75 per cent were not however limited to subjects feigning weakness Further investigations of strength variability are needed under different conditions before confident judgements can be made about patient performance
S350	Classic tennis elbow or lateral epicondylitis has been described as an overuse or misuse injury resulting in a tendinitis The extensor carpi radialis brevis ECRB and extensor digitorum communis EDC have been implicated as primary culprits in this pathology Tennis elbow has been treated using a constrictive band placed several centimeters distal to the origin of these two muscles Aircast Aircast Inc Summit NJ has developed a new style of band that employs an airfilled bladder as the counterpressure element This study tested the effect of both standard and Aircast bands on EMG activity of the EDC and ECRB proximal to the band compared to control values Ten normal subjects ranging in age from 20 to 43 years were tested Right upper extremities were tested in all cases The subjects forearms were stabilized in the CYBEX II forearm stabilization Vpad The ECRB and EDC were then impaled with monopolar EMG needle electrodes The CYBEX data were recorded using the HUMAC system and the EMG data were recorded and analyzed using the Cadwell 7400 EMG data were recorded at 80 of maximum voluntary isometric contraction MVIC with no band the standard band and the Aircast band An analysis of variance ANOVA with repeated measures of integrated EMG IEMG and Duncans multiple comparison tests revealed that the Aircast caused a significant reduction in IEMG of the ECRB and EDC when compared with control values and the standard band The decrease in IEMG with the standard band was not statistically significantABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S351	One hundred thirtyseven limbs with venous obstruction were analyzed The armfoot venous pressure differential and reactive hyperemia tests were found to be useful techniques to diagnose and grade venous obstruction Traditional techniques including venography and ambulatory venous pressure are inferior in this regard The newer techniques have provided newer insights in venous obstruction which are detailed herein The handheld Doppler was surprisingly very sensitive in grade I as well as in more severe forms of obstruction Neither anatomic locale of obstruction nor its extent determined hemodynamic severity Extensive proximal lesions could be hemodynamically mild and conversely distal crural obstructions and single segment lesions could be hemodynamically severe Phlebographic appearance was a poor index of collateralization The paradoxical venous pressure response to the reactive hyperemia test in grade IV obstruction was found to be due to suppression or delay of the reactive hyperemia response itself in the presence of severe venous obstruction The pain of venous claudication may be related to this phenomenon Skin ulceration in the presence of venous obstruction was related to the associated reflux rather than the hemodynamic severity of the obstruction itself The Linton procedure was found to be useful in treating such skin ulcerations After perforator disruption obstruction did not become hemodynamically worse but reflux as measured by the Valsalva test improved with ulcer healing The improvement in reflux related to Valsalva offers for the first time a hemodynamic rationale for the Linton procedure
S352	Using a prospective randomized design the effects on selfreported functional health and well being of 18 months of primary outpatient care in a geriatric clinic staffed by a multidisciplinary team with geriatric training were compared with traditional Veterans Administration care for 205 elders Significantly less decline in functional health was found for the geriatric clinic participants on the total Sickness Impact Profile SIP M  18 vs 312 p  029 and its physical dimension M  28 vs 439 p  011 but not for the psychosocial dimension of the SIP life satisfaction depression selfrated health or affect balance In addition twice as many geriatrics clinic patients died p  10 during the study Further clarification of the impact of a multidisciplinary geriatrics clinic on health outcomes and cost in VA and other settings are needed prior to recommending that this model of geriatric health care be adopted
S353	A 32yearold nulliparous woman underwent hMG induction of superovulation started on the third day of menses The presence of hyperstimulation confused the clinical picture of ectopic pregnancy conceived during the previous cycle This case illustrates that 1 the clinical findings of hyperstimulation may mask those of ectopic pregnancy 2 the ovary is not refractory to hMG in the presence of circulating hCG and 3 an inappropriately high betahCG value is suggestive of gestation initiated during a previous cycle
S354	Although it is now accepted that cryopreserved semen must on ethical and medicolegal grounds be used for donor insemination many clinicians still believe that it has an unacceptably reduced fecundability rate as compared with fresh semen We studied the outcome of 81 recipients who started therapeutic donor insemination TDI treatment during 1986 in a program that used exclusively cryopreserved semen 55 had never undergone TDI and were receiving the first series six cycles 6 were receiving the second series also six cycles and 20 had achieved pregnancy through TDI previously and were starting the treatment again Insemination with semen stored in 05ml French straws was performed daily during the periovulatory period while the modified Insler score was 10 or greater out of 15 A total of 42 52 of the recipients became pregnant within six TDI cycles 4 10 had a spontaneous abortion An average of 48 straws were used per cycle among those who became pregnant and 51 per cycle among those who did not On average 26 cycles were required to achieve pregnancy The overall fecundability rate was 146 We conclude that a TDI program involving exclusively frozen semen can be operated with a success rate comparable to rates achieved with fresh semen if a simple established cryopreservation method and an uncomplicated clinical management protocol are used
S355	A case of massive osteolysis of the skull and its histology is described Removal of the bone defect with a margin of normal bone and covering of the defect by cranioplasty is advised and may arrest the disease
S356	Standard methods of echocardiographic analysis permit accurate categorization of cardiomyopathies into dilated hypertrophic and restrictive types However ascertainment of the cause of a particular cardiomyopathy eg ischemia versus inflammation as the cause of a dilated myopathy with ultrasound would be greatly facilitated by analysis of myocardial composition with ultrasound tissue characterization techniques Qualitative observations have identified unusual echocardiographic image texture in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in amyloidosis Quantitative observations have verified these findings and have identified increased ultrasound backscatter in regions of myocardial fibrosis calcification and anthracyclineinduced cardiomyopathy Although several technical problems remain unsolved and further research is needed in the mechanisms of normal and abnormal ultrasoundtissue interactions tissue characterization with ultrasound has the potential to contribute independent information on myocardial composition in patients with cardiomyopathy
S357	We describe three cases of extracranial vertebral artery dissection that are unusual in both their modes of presentation and their associations with other pathologic conditions The first patient had Marfans syndrome and migraine his dissection was asymptomatic and was diagnosed by chance at the time of repeat angiography following a previous internal carotid artery dissection The second patient had systemic lupus erythematosus and presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage attributed to an intracranial vertebral artery dissection by the demonstration of an extracranial dissection The third patient had a minor basilar artery stroke in which dissection had occurred beside a congenital hemivertebra deformity
S358	The possibility of detecting lipid peroxidation histochemically was investigated in liver tissue in vivo in conditions in which the process has been demonstrated by biochemical methods The technique was based on the detection of aldehyde functions with the use of the Schiffs reagent The study was carried out on bromobenzeneintoxicated mice which generally exhibit levels of lipid peroxidation considerably higher than those observed in the case of other hepatotoxins Liver sections from control animals were unstainable by the reagent while sections from bromobenzenepoisoned mice showed a purple stain of various intensity unhomogeneously distributed sometimes with a mediolobular localization Microphotometric measurements were performed at 565 nm by means of a computercontrolled microscope photometer The ratios of Schiffpositive area relative to total section area as well as the total extinctions referred to 100 sq mu of the sections showed a high correlation with the corresponding hepatic contents of malonic dialdehyde chosen as biochemical index of lipid peroxidation In vitro studies in which liver sections were incubated in the presence of NADPHFe2 showed a Schiff positivity which increased with the incubation time confirming the reliability of the histochemical method Another procedure based on the use of 2OH3naphtoic acid hydrazide coupled with fast blue B was also developed and proved to be possibly more sensitive than Schiffs reagent in the detection of lipid peroxidation in liver tissue
S359	Two traditions of research on the concept of control have developed One tradition involves the experimental manipulation of control usually with a focus on enhancing control and thus improving adjustment and wellbeing The other tradition regards control as a personality or trait variable and has been concerned with the development and validation of scales to measure it Linking these two traditions would help determine if people differentially react to controlenhancing manipulations because of control predispositions This study reports on an investigation into this topic A sample of 209 subjects responded to the Levenson IE scale and a controlenhancing manipulation vs placebo contact and no contact control samples within the context of a longitudinal assessment of stress and mental health in older adults Variables assessed included personal mastery and mental health The results showed significant interactions of the trait and manipulated variables Control enhancement was most effective for those high in control beliefs Some positive benefits of the placebo contact also were found Subjects low in control beliefs did not respond strongly to control manipulations while those high in control did Directions for additional research are discussed
S360	Premature ovarian failure diagnosed from elevated serum gonadotropin concentrations is generally considered irreversible That there have been isolated cases of pregnancy however suggests that ovarian function may persist in these patients We recently studied the longitudinal progress of two patients with intermittent ovarian failure who manifested a spontaneous return of ovarian function and in one patient pregnancy
S361	Juvenile xanthogranuloma presenting as an isolated corneoscleral lesion is rare We report such a case in a 5yearold boy who required lamellar sclerokeratectomy to the level of Descemets membrane Ten months after treatment by total excision and lamellar corneoscleral grafting with donor tissue there was no evidence of recurrence We discuss the clinical and histologic features of this disorder the differential diagnosis and treatment options
S362	Little is known about how the care received in emergency departments ED by the elderly population differs from that received by younger people We prospectively abstracted ED records of 1620 consecutive patients visiting a large community hospital ED over a 22day period in 1984 for demographic and medical variables Charts of patients presenting with five specific complaints dyspnea chest pain abdominal pain syncope and motor vehicle accidents were also analyzed for process of care variables and for patients hospitalized the accuracy of the ED diagnosis Older people ie those greater than or equal to 65 years of age do not seem to be overutilizers of the ED for minor complaints in fact they tend to be more acutely ill on presentation than younger people Older people were more likely to be hospitalized 46 v 10 P less than 001 to arrive by ambulance 35 v 10 P less than 001 and to have an identified source of primary care 95 v 64 P less than 01 Older people stayed longer in the ED than younger people if they were eventually released home but shorter if admitted to the hospital Test ordering patterns for specific complaints varied by patient age eg older patients had more electrocardiograms performed for chest pain and fewer urinalyses for abdominal pain than younger patients Therapy for specific complaints showed less age effect Although generally more diagnostic tests were performed on older patients the ED diagnosis tended to be more accurate for younger patients Our data indicate that the process of ED care may be substantially different for the elderly population and have implications for future planning and financing of medical care
S363	A study was carried out to investigate whether an imbalance in the autonomic nervous system or release of histamine or both is responsible for the nocturnal increase in airflow obstruction in asthmatic children The study comprised 18 children with allergic asthma nine with group 1 and nine without group 2 nocturnal airflow obstruction and an age matched control group All drugs were withheld for three days before and during the study On day 4 each child was admitted to hospital and a series of measurements was made every four hours for 24 hours These included measurements of the forced expiratory volume in one second FEV1 heart rate and sinus arrhythmia gap from an electrocardiogram an indirect measure of parasympathetic activity and urine sampling for determination of catecholamine and Nmethylhistamine concentrations measures of sympathetic activity and histamine release respectively Urinary Nmethylhistamine excretion was significantly higher over the 24 hours in children in group 1 than in children in group 2 and overnight values were also significantly higher in children in group 1 than those in group 2 Mean SEM values mumolmol creatinine were 1546 112 in group 1 and 110 112 in group 2 for 24000400 hours samples and 1392 131 and 1012 106 04000800 hours samples There was no evidence of decreased sympathetic or increased parasympathetic activity in association with the nocturnal airflow obstruction noradrenaline concentrations were increased in group 1 These observations indicate that nocturnal airflow obstruction is associated with increased release of histamine overnight
S364	Clinical and epidemiologic studies suggest that the intake of potassium chloride lowers blood pressure To investigate whether supplemental potassium chloride 96 mmol of microcrystalline potassium chloride a day reduced the need for antihypertensive medication in hypertensive men on a restrictedsodium diet we conducted a randomized placebocontrolled doubleblind clinical trial A total of 287 men 45 to 68 years of age 142 given potassium chloride and 145 given placebo were followed for an average of 22 years after the withdrawal of their antihypertensive medication Men in both groups received instructions on following a lowsodium diet Overnight urinary sodium excretion fell from 63 mmol per eight hours at base line to an average of 45 mmol per eight hours during followup Participants given supplemental potassium chloride had significantly higher P less than 0001 serum potassium levels and urinary potassium excretion averaging 45 mmol per liter and 425 mmol per eight hours respectively during followup than participants given placebo 42 mmol per liter and 200 mmol per eight hours Seventynine participants in each group required reinstitution of antihypertensive medication according to strict indications defined by the protocol No significant differences in systolic or diastolic blood pressure were observed between the two groups During followup systolic and diastolic blood pressure averaged 1306 and 825 mm Hg respectively for participants given supplemental potassium and 1325 and 831 mm Hg for participants given placebo We conclude that supplemental potassium chloride does not reduce the need for antihypertensive medication in hypertensive men on a restrictedsodium diet
S365	Small bowel transplantation SBT has been carried out in man in several cases without success because immunologic problems were unsolved In experimental SBT a two step model was developed which enables long term observation of immunologic phenomena In this model the graft is in a heterotopic position to the recipients own small bowel After 35 days the recipients own bowel is removed and replaced by the graft now in orthotopic position and again in contact with luminal chymus To investigate functional and morphological changes which result from the procedure the resorption of glucose and water was measured in syngeneic transplanted rats by an in vivo recirculation system and the mucosa was evaluated three dimensionally The graft mucosa showed a significant reduction in villus height crypt length and villus surface and a corresponding decrease in glucose and water absorption during heterotopic position If the graft came into the orthotopic position the mucosa did regenerate which was expressed by the significant longer crypts of the graft compared with those of the controls although the grafts villus height and surface are still smaller Glucose and water absorption increased and were higher in orthotopic transplanted animals when absorption was expressed per unit intestinal length The results indicate that in the two step model of SBT the absorption of water and glucose is influenced to such an extent that recovery is possible after three weeks thus enabling orthotopic SBT This almost complete recovery of the mucosa is further evidence of the regeneratory capacity of the small bowel which enables clinical small bowel transplantation
S366	In a prospective randomized study 120 febrile granulocytopenic patients received as initial therapy ceftazidime with or without teicoplanin At the onset of fever patients had no obvious infectious focus For 103 assessable episodes initial bacteremias were detected in 18 of 51 patients 35 given ceftazidime and 20 of 52 patients 38 given the combination 13 and 17 bacteremias caused by grampositive bacteria occurred in these groups respectively There was no difference in terms of the final response 25 of 51 patients 49 treated with ceftazidime alone versus 33 of 52 patients 63 given the combination and the morbidity was comparable for both treatment groups The duration of fever and of total antibiotic therapy were similar in both groups Initial therapy was modified in 26 patients 51 treated with ceftazidime with 20 surviving the infection and in 19 patients 37 treated with the combination with 15 surviving Persistent fever was the main reason for changing treatment and no patient died of a grampositive infection Subsequent infective events occurred in 16 patients 31 given ceftazidime and in 25 patients 48 given the combination Lung infiltrates developed in 12 and 13 patients respectively but more new infections occurred in the combination group Allergic skin reactions were also more frequent in this group Thus while teicoplanin provides simple reliable and safe treatment of patients with presumed grampositive infections it is not useful when given empirically to this patient population and treatment may result in more infective complications and adverse events
S367	The lambda repressor is an activator as well as a repressor of transcription The activation function is blocked by interaction with another lambda repressor molecule bound upstream on the same DNA molecule This example of negative control at a distance involves formation of a DNA loop
S368	The effect of diazepammorphine combination on the righting reflex was studied in rats Doses of the drugs given alone and in combination that block righting reflex RR ED50 were determined with a probit procedure Brain concentrations following equieffective doses of the drugs administered separately and in combination were determined by radioimmunoassay Equieffective intravenous doses and corresponding brain concentrations for the agents were compared with fractional algebraic and isobolographic analyses Interaction between diazepam and morphine was found to be synergistic It is not likely to be pharmacokinetic in nature
S369	Permanent effects of postnatal gonadal function on the hypothalamopituitarythyroid axis were examined in male and female rats of the WistarImamichi strain Animals were used at the age of about 10 weeks Neonatally castrated NC males showed a significantly higher plasma TSH response to TRH 10 microgramskg BW ip than males castrated at 1 2 3 4 or 6 weeks of age The TSH response in intact males was similar to that seen in NC males Neonatal androgenization of NC males with 100 microgramsrat of testosterone propionate decreased the TSH response in the group The anterior pituitary AP TSH content was similar among all male groups The number of AP TRH receptors was significantly higher in both NC males and intact males than in both NC  neonatal androgenization males and 6weekcastrated males In female rats TRHinduced TSH response AP TSH content and AP TRH receptor number were all unaffected by the age of castration whereas intact females significantly exceeded 6weekcastrated females in these three variables The circulating levels of T3 and T4 and hypothalamic TRH content were similar in all groups in each sex These results indicate biphasic effects of postnatal testosterone on the TSH response to TRH that is a permanent inhibition in early postnatal days and a transient stimulation in adult age The effects occurred not via changes in AP TSH content but via changes in AP TRH receptor number In females however postnatal gonads did not exert any permanent effects on the TRHTSH system
S370	The irritable bowel syndrome IBS is a common and poorly understood chronic condition that is treated with a great variety of drugs and other therapies without notable enduring success As there are no objective markers of improvement and because there may be a very large placebo response potential treatments for IBS are difficult to assess Probably the only method that can reliably evaluate IBS therapies is the randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled treatment trial The purpose of this review is to critically examine issues central to establishing the efficacy of treatments for IBS in such trials These include the definition of IBS measures of efficacy the placebo response trial length maintaining blindedness the crossover design ability to generalize and statistical considerations With this background all published IBS treatment trials are examined It is concluded that not a single study offers convincing evidence that any therapy is effective in treating the IBS symptom complex Welldesigned and executed IBS treatment trials are urgently needed suggestions are given for essential features of such trials
S371	We have previously shown that changes in estrogenhepatocyte interaction occur during liver regeneration Following 70 hepatectomy estrogen levels in the blood were elevated the number of estrogen receptors in the liver was increased and there was an active translocation of estrogen receptors from the cytosol to the nucleus The injection of tamoxifen an estrogen antagonist inhibits hepatocyte proliferation following partial hepatectomy The administration of 1 microgram tamoxifen per gm body weight at zero time or 6 hr after the operation resulted in a significant inhibition both of DNA synthesis and of the number of cells in mitosis Injections of tamoxifen 12 hr or later after the operation had no effect Concomitant injections of equimolar amounts of estrogen abolished the inhibition by tamoxifen The effects of estrogen and tamoxifen were also tested on hepatocytes in primary culture Estrogens in the presence of 5 normal rat serum stimulated hepatocyte DNA synthesis as determined by 3Hthymidine incorporation and the labeling index whereas epidermal growth factorinduced DNA synthesis in the absence of normal rat serum was strongly inhibited Tamoxifen in contrast inhibited DNA synthesis of hepatocytes in the presence of 5 normal rat serum and reversed the stimulatory effect of estrogen in the same system Attempts to elucidate the mechanism of tamoxifen inhibition in vitro indicated that one effect of tamoxifen is to prevent the amiloridesensitive Na influx necessary to initiate hepatocyte proliferation
S372	Little is known about the health needs of physically handicapped young adults after they become too old for the paediatric service To assess these needs 104 young people with physical handicaps were given a medical examination and interviewed They had diverse physical handicaps many of which were rare 41 subjects 45 had cerebral palsy and 18 spina bifida Mental handicap 42 subjects and a need for special education 28 were also diagnosed The state of health of all subjects was generally poor Sixty one subjects had contractures of the lower joints and almost a quarter contractures of the upper joints 26 had deformed feet Consequently many subjects 41 could not walk only 13 could walk without difficulty Urinary and bowel incontinence were prevalent 58 and 55 subjects respectively and with contractures and pressure sores resulted in skin problems 35 subjects Kyphoscoliosis was present in 30 subjects particularly those with spina bifida 10 out of 18 of whom one third had respiratory problems and almost half cardiac problems Thirty one subjects had epilepsy Many subjects 49 had difficulty communicating or some visual defect 27 Although over half the subjects had health problems that were severe enough to warrant intervention less than a third were receiving any form of regular hospital care regular contact with physiotherapists speech therapists and dentists was also poor Moreover the original diagnoses and prescriptions had not been reviewed regularly Teams for handicapped adults should be set up in all district health authorities to provide a clinical and coordination service for all adults with physical and mental handicaps
S373	The main objective of these studies was to determine whether the basal release of acetylcholine ACh from brain slices was subject to modulation by muscarinic receptor blockade Incubation of striatal slices with the muscarinic antagonist atropine increased ACh release in a concentrationdependent manner with a maximal effect 1418 times control release achieved with 01 to 10 microM In contrast ACh release from hippocampal slices was unaltered by any concentration of atropine tested indicating that the basal release of neurotransmitter from striatum but not hippocampus was subject to modulation by muscarinic receptor blockade Incubation of striatal slices with 1 microM tetrodotoxin or removal of Ca from the medium decreased the basal release of ACh by 20 and abolished the atropineinduced release of ACh neurotransmitter release from hippocampal slices was unaltered by tetrodotoxin Thus part of the basal release of ACh from striatal slices is a consequence of the intrinsic impulse activity of cholinergic neurons and it is this component of release that is atropinesensitive Oxotremorine was unable to antagonize the atropineinduced release of ACh even with concentrations 100 times that of atropine whereas pirenzepine increased ACh release and like that of atropine the effect of pirenzepine was sensitive to tetrodotoxin and resistant to oxotremorine These results indicate that a component of basal ACh release from striatal slices is subject to modulation by a receptor that is sensitive to atropine and pirenzepine but not to oxotremorine suggesting that this site differs from the nerve terminal muscarinic autoreceptor
S374	The therapeutic action of vigabatrin gamma vinyl GABA GVG has been reported to be mediated by GABAergic neurotransmission In the present study we evaluated different neurotransmitter systems in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF of patients with complex partial epilepsy before and during GVG treatment The markers of the GABAergic system free GABA total GABA homocarnosine showed a two to threefold elevation There was also an increase in glycine during the 6 months of GVG treatment In contrast we did not find any constant CSF changes in either excitatory amino acids or in markers of the cholinergic acetylcholinesterase dopaminergic homovanillic acid serotonergic 5hydroxyindoleacetic acid or peptidergic somatostatin prolactin betaendorphin systems This finding except an elevation in glycine was in agreement with previous studies which suggest a specific action of GVG on the GABAergic system The role of glycine in antiepileptic efficacy of GVG needs further evaluation
S375	Determining the cause of metabolic acidosis with a high anion gap may present a diagnostic challenge Possible causes include ketoacidosis certain toxic ingestions renal failure and lactic acidosis Many of these entities present with nausea vomiting and changes in mental status however there are specific hallmarks in the signs symptoms and laboratory findings that help to differentiate among them
S376	The atrioventricular AV node responds in a complex fashion to changes in activation rate A variety of approaches have been used to explain these dynamic AV nodal responses but none has been able to account fully for AV nodal behavior Three specific ratedependent properties of the AV node have been described 1 timedependent recovery after excitation 2 an effect of short cycles to advance recovery facilitation and 3 a gradual slowing of conduction in response to sustained highfrequency activation fatigue We hypothesized that a model incorporating quantitative descriptors of all three processes might be able to account for a wide variety of AV nodal behaviors Quantitative descriptors of AV nodal recovery facilitation and fatigue were developed based on AV nodal conduction changes during selective pacing protocols in seven autonomically blocked dogs These descriptors were incorporated into a set of mathematical equations that define AV nodal conduction of any beat based on activation history The equations were then applied to predict pacinginduced Wenckebach periodicity in each dog Experimental data were obtained after nine to 19 step decreases in atrial cycle length into the Wenckebach zone in each animal Observed behaviors included complex patterns of block a progressive increase in the level of block over 5 minutes of rapid pacing and periods of alternating patterns of block The model accurately predicted the onset of AV block at each cycle length the relation between conduction ratio and cycle length as a function of time and the changing patterns of Wenckebach periodicity during sustained atrial pacing All three terms of the model equation describing recovery facilitation and fatigue were essential to account fully for the observed behaviors Elimination of AV nodal fatigue from the model resulted in failure to account for timedependent changes in Wenckebach patterns whereas exclusion of facilitation led to consistent overestimation of the degree of AV block at each cycle length We conclude that a mathematical model incorporating terms to describe recovery facilitation and fatigue accurately predicts a wide range of Wenckebachtype behavior and that complex conduction patterns of the AV node can be fully accounted for by simple functional AV nodal properties
S377	We compared two procedures for the emergency treatment of bleeding esophageal varices in patients who did not respond to blood transfusion and vasoactive drugs We randomly assigned 101 patients with cirrhosis of the liver and bleeding esophageal varices to undergo either emergency sclerotherapy n  50 or staple transection of the esophagus n  51 Four patients assigned to sclerotherapy and 12 assigned to staple transection did not actually undergo those procedures but all analyses were made on an intentiontotreat basis Total mortality did not differ significantly between the two groups the relative risk of death for staple transection as compared with sclerotherapy was 088 95 percent confidence interval 051 to 154 Mortality at six weeks was 44 percent among those assigned to sclerotherapy and 35 percent among those assigned to staple transection Complication rates were similar for the two groups An interval of five days without bleeding was achieved in 88 percent of those assigned to staple transection and in 62 percent of those assigned to sclerotherapy after a single injection P less than 001 and 82 percent after three injections In only 2 of the 11 patients who received a third sclerotherapy injection was bleeding controlled for more than five days and 9 died We conclude that staple transection of the esophagus is as safe as sclerotherapy for the emergency treatment of bleeding esophageal varices and that it is more effective than a single sclerotherapy procedure We currently recommend surgery after two injection treatments have failed
S378	Twenty patients with metastatic prostatic cancer were treated on an ambulatory basis with continuous 5fluorouracil 5FU infusion 250300 mgM2 per day through a chronic indwelling central venous catheter All patients had symptomatic progressive disease despite previous standard therapies Partial remission was seen in 2 of 20 patients 10 stable disease in 9 of 20 45 and progressive disease in 9 of 20 45 mean duration of benefit in responding and stable disease patients was six months Improvement in pain and ECOG performance status were seen in most of the patients in the responding and stable disease categories Forty percent of the patients experienced no significant drug toxicity treatment interruption was necessary for stomatitis in 6 patients 30 handfoot syndrome in 3 patients 15 and diarrhea in 1 patient 5 No significant myelosuppression or other significant organ toxicities were encountered Continuous systemic venous infusion of 5FU may provide significant palliative effect for some patients with symptomatic refractory carcinoma of the prostate
S379	Pseudallescheria boydii is an increasingly important cause of infection in debilitated and immunocompromised persons It is frequently found within pulmonary cavities where it forms matted collections of fungal hyphae variously termed fungus balls fungomas or pseudallescheriomas This report describes the unusual occurrence of pseudallescheriomas in the lungs brain and kidney The morphological features of the fungomas varied between involved organs with those in the lung showing welldefined layers of peripheral mycelial hypocellularity and hypercellularity consisting of anneloconidiophores and conidia The fungomas in all organs were derived from necrotic host tissue which resulted from nodular infarction due to fungal invasion and thrombosis of blood vessels I believe that some previous cases of Pseudallescheria pulmonary fungomas that were ascribed to passive colonization of preformed lung cavitations may have been due to frankly invasive mycotic disease
S380	Neuroblastoma is one of the most common tumors in childhood However it often has been difficult to compare clinical and laboratory studies of this disease due to a lack of uniform criteria for diagnosis staging and response An international group of conferees addressed each of these issues and reached a consensus Specific criteria for making a diagnosis of neuroblastoma are defined A new neuroblastoma staging system is proposed that takes into account the most important elements of current but incompatible systems Finally criteria for response to treatment are standardized The criteria proposed herein represent an international consensus of essentially every major pediatric oncology group or organization in the United States Europe and Japan The staging system should be referred to as the International Neuroblastoma Staging System and the response criteria as the International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria Implementation of these criteria will greatly facilitate the comparison of clinical and laboratory studies by different groups and countries Furthermore these criteria should serve as a foundation on which future modifications or improvements can be based
S381	A further histopathological complication of atypical mycobacterial infection in acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS is reported Positive reactivity between mycobacterial antibodies within a polyclonal antiserum and mycobacteria within tissues resulted in false positivity with this reagent to factor VIII related antigen This complication may be avoided either by prior testing of the antiserum or by purification or by the use of monoclonal antibodies Histopathologists examining tissues from patients with AIDS and those with disseminated mycobacterial infections and using immunohistochemical techniques should be aware of this occurrence
S382	Cells from eight different human melanomas and two murine melanomas were injected into the internal carotid artery of anesthetized nude mice Although all were injected by the same route particular melanomas produced lesions in different regions of the brain Two melanoma cell lines isolated originally from brain metastases in patients produced metastases predominantly in the brain parenchyma In contrast melanoma cells from subcutaneous or lymph node metastases produced more lesions in the meninges choroid plexus and ventricles than in the brain parenchyma All of the melanomas grew in the brain after a direct intracerebral injection The pattern of brain metastasis did not correlate with tumorigenicity per se or with the ability of the melanomas to grow in the lungs of nude mice Two mouse melanomas showed different patterns of experimental metastasis after internal carotid artery injection with one growing predominantly in the parenchyma and the other more frequently in the meninges and choroid plexus The growth pattern of human melanoma metastasis in the brain of T celldeficient nude mice suggests that it is determined by properties unique to each tumor interacting with the hosts organ microenvironment
S383	Plasma neurotensin concentrations are rapidly elevated after oral ingestion or intraduodenal infusion of fat apparently before fat reaches the ileum where neurotensin is highly concentrated The purpose of this study was to investigate the site of neurotensin release and to determine whether neurotensin is released by direct luminal stimulation by fat in conscious dogs Dogs were prepared with isolated jejunal or ileal segments and portal vein catheters Release of neurotensin into the portal venous blood was examined by selective perfusion of each intestinal segment with sodium oleate The results of this study show that selective perfusion of the jejunum but not the ileum with sodium oleate caused a significant release of neurotensin We speculate that release of ileal neurotensin is not due to direct luminal stimulation but is mediated by local neural or humoral intermediates
S384	Reducedsize hepatic transplantation has evolved into a clinically useful procedure particularly at institutions specializing in treating pediatric patients It is being adopted by many of the hepatic transplantation institutions in the United States as a result of its effectiveness in providing a greater number of donors for small recipients and an outcome equal to fullsize hepatic transplantation It has led to the development of splitliver transplantation which is at present not universally applicable because of its complexity but could double the supply of donors available to small patients It is also the precursor of orthotopic auxiliary transplantation which could become the preferred method for treating children with metabolic diseases but no structural changes such as cirrhosis Finally the knowledge gained in reducedsize hepatic transplantation will inevitably lead to transplantation using living donors which could completely alleviate the shortage of donors for small patients
S385	A group of 191 patients with systemic scleroderma and 12 patients with silicosisassociated scleroderma were investigated for connective tissue turnover The serum levels of type III collagen aminopropeptide PIIIP the laminin PI Lam PI fragment and the acid lysosomal betagalactosidase betaGal were determined by specific radioimmunoassays and spectrofluorometry respectively Increased levels of type III collagen aminopropeptide strongly correlated with enhanced activity of betagalactosidase Both parameters correlated with the clinical course in idiopathic systemic scleroderma and in silicosisassociated scleroderma Serum levels of Lam PI were also found to be elevated in both groups although there was no correlation with the severity of the disease Autoantibodies directed against the DNA topoisomerase Scl70 and against centromeric proteins were found in a similar range in patients with idiopathic systemic and silicosisassociated scleroderma These results suggest that PIIIP Lam PI and betaGal are useful serological markers of fibrotic activity and demonstrate similarities between idiopathic systemic scleroderma and scleroderma associated with silicadust exposure
S386	A case of brain metastasis from urachal carcinoma is reported Originally the source of the tumor was unknown Histologic diagnosis of resected specimen was adenocarcinoma Later removal of urachal carcinoma with partial resection of the bladder revealed adenocarcinoma identical to that of the brain tumor
S387	The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of singleenergy computed tomography in determining iron overload in idiopathic hemochromatosis with special reference to slightly overloaded cases Liver attenuation was determined in 100 patients 46 cases of idiopathic hemochromatosis 32 cases of chronic liver disease and 22 normal controls The iron load was determined for the first two groups by biochemical determination of liver iron concentration performed in all but 12 subjects in the chronic liver disease group and hepatic histologic grading The main results for liver attenuation upper normal limit 72 Hounsfield units showed that despite a high specificity 096 this parameter was of low sensitivity 063 Although mean liver attenuation in idiopathic hemochromatosis 77  14 was significantly higher than in chronic liver diseases 53  17 p less than 104 and normal controls 66  3 p less than 103 and despite an overall good correlation between liver attenuation and liver iron concentration r  072 p less than 103 liver attenuation was unable to detect moderate iron overload Fourteen of 18 patients with a liver iron concentration of less than 150 mumolg dry liver wt had liver attenuation values of less than 72 Moreover 3 of 18 subjects with a liver iron concentration of greater than 150 had a liver attenuation of less than 72 Of these 17 falsenegatives only 7 could be attributed to associated steatosis On the whole singleenergy computed tomography when used on a routine basis for diagnosing iron overload is of limited clinical value in idiopathic hemochromatosis due to its poor sensitivity Hepatic histologic examination together with biochemical determination remains the most accurate means to assess liver iron
S388	We analyzed lung specimens from 23 affected members of 13 families with known familial primary pulmonary hypertension In this heritable disease the pathogenetic basis of disease should be distinct within families and the pathologic lesions should reflect the underlying biologic mechanisms Two pathologic types of primary pulmonary hypertension have been proposed to exist plexogenic and thromboembolic The purpose of this study was to determine the nature and variety of pathologic lesions in families with familial primary pulmonary hypertension and to discover whether the pattern of pathologic lesions found supported the existence of two types of disease We found marked heterogeneity of pathologic lesions within and among families including frequent coexistence of thrombotic and plexiform lesions We conclude that the lesions found in primary pulmonary hypertension are not specific but represent different manifestations of the same pathologic process Thus plexiform and thrombotic lesions of the pulmonary arterioles may not arise from distinctly different biologic processes but may simply be different manifestations of the same process Further insights in primary pulmonary hypertension must come from study of the biologic aspects of the intimal lesion
S389	Malpractice actions against pediatricians treating patients with arrhythmias have been recurrent in four general areas Optimal medical management may not be widely recognized Cases illustrating the following concepts are presented Intravenous verapamil therapy in babies may cause apnea hypotension and bradycardia continued episodes of atrial flutter in a child may cause sudden death quinidine may be related to the death children with familial seizure disorders may in fact have the long QT interval syndrome The QT interval must be measured on the ECG in patients with unexplained seizures supraventricular tachycardia with aberration is uncommon in children Rapid heart rates with QRS complexes that are different from the sinus complexes are likely to be ventricular tachycardia These situations must be recognized as potential problems and must be treated appropriately
S390	Day14 fetal CD4 CD8 thymocytes showed a greater proliferative response to PMA  IL4 than did adult doublenegative thymocytes In contrast adult doublenegative thymocytes were more responsive to PMA  IL1  IL2 or to IL1  IL2 alone The adult doublenegative thymocytes showed significantly greater proliferation than fetal thymocytes after stimulation via antiCD3 or antiThy1 in the presence or absence of interleukins IL1  IL2 or IL4 Adult CD4 CD8 thymocytes also exhibited greater calcium mobilization following antiCD3 stimulation IL2dependent activation with antiThy1 or IL1  IL2 in the absence of PMA resulted in marked expansion of CD 3 F231 CD4 CD8 thymocytes a population absent in fetal thymocytes but constituting 4 of precultured CD4 CD8 adult thymocytes IL4  PMA failed to expand this CD 3 population It is hypothesized that before expression of functional TCR T cell development may be more dependent on activation pathways not using IL2 after TCR expression IL2dependent pathways including Thy1mediated stimulation become functional
S391	Five women group A with polycystic ovarian disease PCOD and sterility for at least 3 yr were treated for 1 cycle for ovulation induction with a combined regimen of GnRH agonist GnRHA plus highly purified FSH The patients received GnRHA Buserelin 200 micrograms sc twice a day for 6 weeks and then GnRHA combined with FSH highly purified 2 ampules a day 75 IU FSH and less than 011 IU LH in each ampule Ovarian response was evaluated by plasma estradiol E2 assay and ultrasound examination performed daily Furthermore plasma FSH and LH levels were assayed 3 times a week Once a follicle was considered sufficiently developed the combined regimen was withheld and 2448 h later hCG 5000 IU im was given The results are compared with those of 31 ovulatory cycles induced by im FSH highly purified group B in PCOD patients with the same FSH administration clinical and monitoring protocols Ovulation was achieved in all cycles treated by GnRHA plus FSH Two singleton and a twin pregnancy resulted Multiple follicular development occurred in all cycles Plasma E2 levels were generally in the normal range Echographic and endocrine features in the 2 groups were as follows 1 basal ovarian volume and ovarian enlargement were similar 2 Group A had a greater number of follicles than did group B P less than 001 while E2 to number of follicles and E2 to ovarian volume ratios were greater P less than 001 in group B 3 The linear correlations between plasma E2 levels and ovarian volume were markedly different in groups A and B P less than 001 The regression line for group B had a steeper slope than that for group A This finding indicates that at a fixed ovarian volume plasma E2 levels were significantly lower in group A than in group B We conclude that the combined GnRHA and FSH regimen may constitute an alternative and promising tool for the induction of ovulation in patients with PCOD
S392	Midazolam hydrochloride is an ultrashort acting benzodiazepine recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration for anesthesia induction and preoperative sedation Frequently midazolam is also used as an injection or infusion for the treatment of agitation in ventilatordependent patients A 53yearold man underwent a gastrojejunostomy and was later intubated following the development of pseudomonal pneumonia Midazolam was initiated in an effort to resolve his agitation and the patient continued to receive frequent bolus injections averaging 22 mgd over 21 days Approximately eight hours after midazolam was abruptly discontinued the patient became increasingly anxious and developed somatic complaints felt to be consistent with benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome Symptoms rapidly abated upon the reintroduction of midazolam and the drug was ultimately tapered over a period of four days and discontinued without further incident Implications derived from the association of longterm midazolam therapy with benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome are discussed
S393	Few data from randomised prospective studies address whether early diet influences later neurodevelopment in man As part of a larger multicentre trial 502 low birthweight infants were assigned randomly for a median of 30 days to receive a preterm formula or unfortified donor breast milk as sole diets or as supplements to their mothers expressed milk Surviving infants were assessed at nine months after their expected date of delivery without knowledge of their feeding regimen The mean developmental quotient was 025 standard deviations lower in those fed donor breast milk rather than preterm formula In infants fed their mothers expressed milk however the disadvantage of receiving banked milk compared with preterm formula as a supplement was greater when the supplement was over half the total intake and approached five points representing 05 standard deviations for developmental quotient Infants fed donor breast milk were at particular disadvantage following fetal growth retardation with developmental quotients 53 points lower We suggest that the diet used for low birthweight babies over a brief but perhaps critical postnatal period has developmental consequences that persist into infancy infants who are small for gestational age are especially vulnerable to suboptimal postnatal nutrition
S394	The distribution of fibronectin FN laminin LAM and collagen IV Coll IV three components of the basement membranes BM was investigated in human hepatocellular carcinoma HCC and the surrounding uninvolved liver and was compared with the grade of differentiation of the tumor The following three patterns of BM antigens were observed in HCC 1 peritrabecular or periacinar 2 pericellular and 3 stromalvascular In the more differentiated tumors FN LAM and Coll IV were observed in a peritrabecular or periacinar pattern whereas a pericellular pattern was only seen with antiFN antisera that occasionally stained the content of acini Double staining showed that the four antigens were usually codistributed Occasionally however there was a different distribution along the BM suggesting an heterogeneity in the composition of BM In the more anaplastic tumors and in the intrahepatic metastasis BM components were seen around vessels and in the stroma and they were usually fragmented The finding that FN can be located pericellularly or within acini supports the concept that FN is synthesized at least in part by hepatoma cells The peritrabecular and periacinar location of Coll IV and LAM suggests a sinusoidal cell derivation of these two antigens The immunohistochemical staining patterns for BM in HCC reflect the differentiation of the tumor with differentiated tumors showing a relatively intact BM and poorly differentiated tumors showing a sharply defective BM
S395	Induction of resistance to a Schistosoma mansoni infection was analyzed following injections of glutaraldehydefixed parasites or of subfractions prepared from nonfixed parasites killed by repeated freezethaw cycles The parasites were isolated from mice infected 4 weeks previously and the subfractions were prepared by extraction in buffered saline or in detergent A variety of immunization protocols were conducted in rats and mice These included different sites of injection dose size and number of booster injections different adjuvants and the effects of boosting with live infections Induction of a partial resistance is observed in rats but has not been achieved in mice immunized by the same procedures The alumprecipitated detergentsolubilized fraction was superior at lower doses Exposure of rats to a low dose cercarial infection 3 weeks prior to challenge did not boost the resistance if the rats were already partially resistant through vaccination with worm subfractions in adjuvant Serum from vaccinated rats transfers partial protection to a challenge infection of naive rats
S396	We have examined 39 couples each consisting of one HIVseropositive index case and one seronegative sexual partner HIV isolations HIV antigen HIVAg tests and HIV antibody tests were performed on samples from these 78 individuals Results were compared with those of 68 unselected individuals Neither HIV nor HIVAg was detected in any of the seronegative individuals HIVAg tests but not HIV isolations showed positive results with a significantly lower frequency in symptomatic index cases than in unselected patients with symptoms This indicates that the absence of HIVAg in the serum may be correlated with a low level of contagiousness
S397	It could take at least a decade to develop hightemperature superconductors suited to practical applications Economic considerations suggest that the new materials will have their biggest impact not on largescale applications in the electricpower industry or transportation but on smaller devices for manufacturing electronics and medicine
S398	The aim of this study was to assess the individual effects of cooling increased oxygenation and umbilical cord occlusion on nonshivering thermogenesis in utero A cooling coil was placed around eight fetal sheep of 132145 days gestation thermistors were placed in the fetal esophagus and maternal iliac artery vascular catheters and a tracheal catheter were inserted and a snare was placed loosely around the umbilical cord The next day cold water was circulated through the coil for 5 h During the 1st h of cooling alone fetal core temperature fell 279 degrees C but indexes of brown fat activity increased only slightly After ventilation with O2 plasma free fatty acid concentration FFA rose 74fold to 244  42 mu eql glycerol concentration rose fourfold to 376  85 microM and the difference between brown fat and core temperature widened to 060  010 degrees C Ventilation with N2enriched air did not evoke similar responses After snaring the umbilical cord while ventilation was continued FFA rose to 554  95 mu eql glycerol rose to 684  76 microM and the temperature difference widened to 077  013 degrees C Wholebody O2 consumption peaked at 196 mlmin1kg1 of fetal tissue We conclude that fetal thermogenic responses are limited in part by O2 delivery to brown fat and are augmented by occlusion of the umbilical cord
S399	In an attempt to define better the sonographic findings of adenomyosis of the uterus we reviewed sonograms in seven cases of pathologically proven extensive adenomyosis without associated uterine diseases In all cases the uterus was enlarged In five cases the posterior wall of the uterus was thickened and echoes in the endometrial cavity were eccentric Six cases showed a slight decrease in uterine echogenicity One case had sonographic findings suggestive of a calcified leiomyoma The diagnosis of adenomyosis cannot be made conclusively by sonography However it can be suggested if the uterus is slightly enlarged and if the posterior portion of the myometrium is anechoic and thickened
S400	An ELISA test determined serologically that eight of 95 apparently healthy men aged 1926 years had an asymptomatic infection with Helicobacter pylori at the time of simultaneous measurement of 24 hour intragastric acidity and 24 hour plasma gastrin concentration There was no significant difference in the median integrated 24 hour intragastric acidity between the H pylori positive and H pylori negative subjects 688 and 842 mmolhl p  0271 respectively whereas the median integrated 24 hour plasma gastrin concentration was significantly higher in the H pylori positive than in the H pylori negative subjects 389 and 198 pmolhl p less than 0001 Longterm hypergastrinaemia associated with persistent H pylori infection could be a cause of the increased parietal cell mass that is considered characteristic of duodenal ulcer patients
S401	A 70yearold white man who was malnourished and demented presented with a painful black gangrenousappearing right foot with a fungating mass and required amputation Pathological sections of the tissue specimens showed numerous birefringent crystals which were identified as calcium oxalate Branching septate hyphae and darkly pigmented fungal fruiting heads with double sterigmata characteristic of Aspergillus niger were also identified in the tissue sections No systemic or other metabolic causes of oxalosis were found The calcium oxalate crystal deposition was felt to be secondary to Aspergillus niger infection
S402	Aneurysmal bone cyst is an uncommon benign lesion that rarely presents in the craniofacial region No prior reports of this entity involving the mandible could be found in the otolaryngologic literature and it has been reported only infrequently in the maxilla Two previously unreported cases originating in the mandible are presented with a review of the literature pathology and diagnosis of this lesion Treatment of this lesion consists of complete surgical removal and immediate bone grafting for reconstruction
S403	The outcome of laminectomy for the relief of symptoms resulting from degenerative lumbar stenosis is not well established Eightyeight consecutive patients who had had a laminectomy for degenerative lumbar stenosis between 1983 and 1986 were studied Eight of the patients had had a concomitant arthrodesis The followup evaluation included a review of charts and standardized questionnaires that were completed by the patients One year postoperatively five patients 6 per cent had had a second operation and five still had severe pain By the time of the latest followup in 1989 fifteen 17 per cent of the original eightyeight patients had had a repeat operation because of instability or stenosis twentyone 30 per cent of the seventy patients who were evaluated by questionnaire in 1989 had severe pain The factors found to be associated with a poor longterm outcome defined as severe pain or the need for a repeat operation or both included coexisting illnesses such as osteoarthrosis cardiac disease rheumatoid arthritis or chronic pulmonary disease p  0004 the duration of followup p  001 and an initial laminectomy involving a single interspace p  004 We concluded that the longterm outcome of decompressive laminectomy is less favorable than has been previously reported and that comorbidity and a singleinterspace laminectomy are risk factors for a poor outcome
S404	Patients with acute paraplegia from trauma have an increased frequency of developing gastric stress ulceration and subsequent hemorrhage Current treatment of gastric stress ulcer is by antacids or H2 antagonists but despite such therapy stress ulceration still occurs probably because these agents are unable to maintain gastric pH above 4 Omeprazole which blocks the terminal step of acid secretionthe proton pump can produce longlasting achlorhydria This study examined the efficacy of omeprazole in preventing stress ulcer in rats with acute cervical cord transection Omeprazole was administered intraduodenally at 1725 2625 35 and 175 mgkg and the ulcer incidence and gastric acid output were measured Omeprazole produced a dosedependent inhibition of gastric acid output in the cervical cord transected rat At the highest dose complete achlorhydria was achieved The quantity of gastric ulceration was inversely proportional to the omeprazole dosage with nearly complete prevention of ulceration at the highest dose In conclusion omeprazole is very effective in preventing gastric stress ulcers in the spinal cord transected rat This appears to be related to its potent longlasting inhibitory effect on gastric acidity
S405	Left ventricular performance was evaluated noninvasively in 111 patients participating at one study center in the Norwegian Multicenter Study on Timolol After Myocardial Infarction Systolic time intervals were measured in 55 patients treated with timolol and in 56 patients receiving placebo Measurements were made before randomization and after 1 3 and 12 months of treatment During the treatment period the preejection periodleft ventricular ejection time ratio was significantly lower in the timololtreated group indicating better left ventricular function than in the placebotreated patients In the 27 patients who died during the followup period of 50 to 72 months there was a significant increase in the preejection periodleft ventricular ejection time ratio from baseline to the last performed recording indicating a deterioration in left ventricular performance in these patients No such change occurred in the group that survived the entire followup period Deterioration of left ventricular function is related to a high longterm mortality rate after myocardial infarction and left ventricular function is better preserved in patients treated with timolol than in patients receiving placebo
S406	To assess the use of the Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine and the attitudes of health professionals regarding its use in the pediatric population we conducted a study of community clinics health department clinics universitybased teaching clinics and private practice groups in the state of Texas Whereas 596 of the private practice groups and 571 of the universitybased teaching clinics administered the vaccine to more than 75 of their eligible children 727 of community clinics and 817 of health department clinics never administered the vaccine to their eligible children Likewise whereas 100 of the universitybased teaching clinics and 957 of the private practice groups had the vaccine available to their patients only 227 of the community clinics and 155 of the health department clinics did so The two most common reasons given by health professionals concerning the nonuse of the vaccine were nonavailability and high cost of the vaccine Our findings suggest that a large segment of eligible children do not have access to this important vaccine and that children who depend on community and health department clinics for their routine health care are particularly affected in this regard Strategies identified to increase the use of the vaccine include providing vaccine free of charge increasing patient awareness of the vaccine benefits and passing mandatory state laws requiring vaccine administration before daycare enrollment
S407	Immunohistological techniques using monoclonal antibodies were employed to study the morphology and phenotypic expression of macrophage like cells in ulcerative colitis Crohns colitis and histologically normal colonic mucosa The antibody RFD1 identifies interdigitating antigen presenting cells whereas RFD7 binds to mature tissue macrophages In normal colonic mucosa the majority of cells recognised by these reagents were positive for Class II antigen expression and a median 87 range 8095 were positive for both RFD1 and RFD7 with 65 ranges 114 positive for either antibody alone There was much greater macrophage heterogeneity in the ulcerative colitis and Crohns colitis biopsies than in normal mucosa Clusters of RFD9 cells epithelioid cells were found in Crohns colitis and to a lesser extent in ulcerative colitis Some Crohns colitis sections showed replacement of the normal colonic macrophage phenotype with RFD1RFD7 cells classical scavenger macrophages The degree of this replacement correlated with the histological severity of the disease By contrast large numbers of RFD1 RFD7 cells with long dendritic processes were found in intimate association with the lymphoid infiltrates in the lamina propria of the ulcerative colitis sections Future studies of the factors controlling macrophage differentiation in tissues may help to explain the greater macrophage heterogeneity in inflammatory bowel disease and the differences between ulcerative colitis and Crohns colitis observed in this study
S408	To obtain information regarding patterns of alcohol and substance use portions of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule DIS were administered to 53 schizophrenic patients who presented to the crisis service of an emergency room in a major general hospital The number of individuals in the sample qualifying for a lifetime diagnosis of an alcohol abuserelated disorder was quite high 47 and there was a strong correlation between disorders of alcohol abuse and the use of other drugs Other than alcohol marijuana was the most frequently abused drug Individuals who qualified for a diagnosis of an alcoholrelated disorder were compared with those who did not on a variety of diagnostic and demographic variables The authors conclude by suggesting that the highrisk rates of drug userelated disorders reported in this sample may be due to the preferential use of emergency services by schizophrenic patients with alcohol and drug abuserelated disorders
S409	Results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria isolated at the Mayo Clinic were reviewed for 1982 through 1987 and compared with a previous survey during 1977 through 1981 at this institution Between the earlier and the later period clindamycin resistance increased in the Bacteroides fragilis group from 4 of isolates to 8 We noted continuing penicillin resistance among Bacteroides species other than B fragilis and rare penicillin resistance among Fusobacterium organisms with four isolates during the 1982 through 1987 period being betalactamase producers The high levels of resistance to some agents seen in certain Clostridium species in 1977 through 1981 were not as great in the current survey No major changes were noted in the susceptibilities of C perfringens anaerobic nonsporeforming grampositive bacilli and anaerobic grampositive cocci
S410	We evaluated the pharmacokinetics and adequacy of gentamicin or tobramycin after administration of a loading dose of 3 mgkg body weight in 14 critically ill patients with presumed sepsis Therapeutic blood levels after loading dose were obtained in 13 of the 14 patients Measured volume of distribution serum halflife and elimination rate constant were significantly different from values calculated by using standard formulae All the patients tolerated the dose well without significant deterioration in renal function Based on the present study we conclude that administration of 3 mgkg body weight loading dose of gentamicin or tobramycin in critically ill patients with sepsis would result in earlier therapeutic drug levels
S411	The mechanical energy costs of walking were studied in 10 cerebral palsied children with hemiplegia to determine whether their values were substantially different from normal and if so to discover the movements that were responsible A twodimensional sagittalplane cinematographic analysis of the subjects normal walking was undertaken This technique provided continuous information about the mechanical energy costs of the whole body and each of its parts the energy types involved and the amounts of energy conserved In most cases the energy costs were above normal and were attributable to poor patterns of exchange between the potential and kinetic energy types of the head arms and trunk segment to very low levels of kinetic energy that precluded exchange or to both We concluded that attention should be directed to restoring the sinusoidal pattern of motion and to the fluctuating speeds during each gait cycle when energy costs are a therapeutic consideration
S412	Pathologic hoof changes in horses and swine can be normalized by administration of biotin This vitamin has been given orally to women with brittle fingernails or onychoschizia The aim of the study was to test whether the favorable clinical results could be corroborated by scanning electron microscopy We investigated the distal ends of the fingernails from 32 persons They were placed into three groups group A consisted of 10 control subjects with normal nails group B comprised eight patients with brittle nails studied before and after biotin treatment and group C was 14 patients with brittle nails in whom the administration of biotin did not coincide exactly with the initial and terminal clipping of the nails The thickness of the nails in group B increased significantly by 25 In group C the increase was 7 Splitting of the nails were reduced in groups B and C and the irregular cellular arrangement of the dorsal surface of brittle nails became more regular in all nails of group B and in 8 of 11 nails of group C
S413	Sixtythree consecutive cases 95 eyes of glaucoma in children were studied Glaucoma associated with congenital anomalies group II formed the largest group in this study This accounted for 46 of the cases compared to primary congenital glaucoma group I that accounted for 222 Secondary glaucoma group III occurred in 318 The presenting signs and symptoms in group I were tearing and corneal edema In 50 of the cases in groups II and III diagnosis was made on a routine ophthalmologic examination Surgery was performed in 958 of eyes in group I 532 in group II and 542 in group III The best visual prognosis occurred in group I where 773 of affected eyes had visual acuity equal to or better than 2050 with good pressure control in all This was followed by group II where 415 had vision equal to or better than 2050 and 414 had 20200 vision or less Intraocular pressure remained uncontrolled in 191 of this group The worst prognosis and morbidity was found in group III where 305 of eyes had 2050 vision or better and 478 had 20200 vision or less In group III 333 had uncontrolled intraocular pressure
S414	A clinical teaching assessment form was used to evaluate the teaching by faculty and residents in the required thirdyear medicine clerkship over a twoyear period Data from 1627 forms were analyzed for differences between groups of teachers at different experience levels and for comparison of teaching programs at different training sites The level of involvement of instructor with student correlated with ratings by the students Among groups of instructors chief medical residents received the highest overall ratings Faculty were rated higher than first second and thirdyear residents when degree of involvement of instructor with student was high Ratings among faculty of different academic ranks were not significantly different Analysis of data from different clinical settings showed that the teaching efforts by clinical faculty members in the ambulatory setting received the highest ratings from students Although increased involvement of instructors with students or other factors may have led to the higher ratings in the ambulatory setting the results are encouraging for the use of ambulatory teaching sites for the basic medicine clerkship
S415	Although fructose is widely regarded as an insulinindependent fuel source its in vivo conversion to glucose represents a theoretical limitation to its clinical usefulness in diabetics particularly if given in large doses To determine whether small amounts of fructose can be well utilized in the setting of insulinopenia we administered a lowdose fructose infusion 42 ghr to a fasting type 1 diabetic patient receiving continuous subcutaneous insulin at a dose that had previously maintained stable euglycemia for 72 hr plasma glucose  80110 mgdl Despite the low infusion rate less than 20 of calorie requirement fructose caused an immediate and marked rise in plasma glucose to 370 mgdl after 27 hr Glucose loss in the urine and accumulation in plasma could account for fully half of the administered hexose load Thus the utilization of even small quantities of exogenous fructose is profoundly impaired under hypoinsulinemic conditions It is misleading to regard fructose as a truly insulinindependent fuel source
S416	The mechanism of bradykinininduced contraction in rabbit urinary detrusor was investigated using an antiinflammatory drug tiaramide The contraction as well as prostaglandin PG E2 release induced by bradykinin was abolished by treatment with indomethacin indicating that the contraction was mediated by PGs The accumulation of inositol phosphates IP by bradykinin was partly inhibited by treatment with indomethacin suggesting that part of the IP accumulation was due to PGs Although the remaining accumulation of IPs induced by bradykinin in the presence of indomethacin should elicit contraction in smooth muscle cells indomethacin abolished bradykinininduced contraction The dissociation between indomethacininduced inhibition of IP accumulation and contraction induced by bradykinin might be explained by the existence of PGgenerating cells in addition to smooth muscle cells Bradykinin stimulates phospholipase C which leads to an increase in intracellular free Ca activation of phospholipase A2 and release of PGs in the PGgenerating cells The released PGs act on smooth muscle cells to elicit contractions via phospholipase C activation and Ca mobilization Tiaramide inhibited the PGE2 release and contraction induced by bradykinin by reducing the arachidonic acid release from membrane phospholipid but did not have a direct effect on cyclooxygenase Tiaramide reduced IP accumulation induced by bradykinin to an extent similar to indomethacin However tiaramide had no effect on IP accumulation induced by PGE2 although it potently inhibited the contraction induced by PGE2 which elicits contractions without affecting phospholipase A2 The rise in intracellular free Ca induced by PGE2 as well as bradykinin was inhibited by tiaramideABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S417	To assess the role of highfrequency ventilator strategy in the propagation of airway injury we compared the tracheobronchial histologic alterations in 20 newborn piglets ventilated for 8 hours with highfrequency flow interruption HFFI Ten animals were assigned to HFFI with a strategy of continuous pulsations at a frequency of 10 Hz and a mean airway pressure of 16 cm H2O Ten piglets were treated at identical settings except for 10 onesecond baseline pauses per minute to a positive endexpiratory pressure of 5 cm H2O A semiquantitative scoring system was used to grade light microscopic tissue alterations in the trachea carina and mainstem bronchi Ultrastructural changes were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy The HFFIcontinuoustreated piglets had significantly more damage in all areas than the HFFIbaseline pause group P less than 001 The upper tracheas of animals in both groups were altered to a greater extent than the lower tracheas P less than 007 In addition numerous skip areas of injury were noted throughout the tracheas Highfrequency ventilator strategy is a determinant of the severity of airway histologic changes Factors that adversely affect tissue oxygenation or cause direct mechanical trauma may also influence the degree of injury Optimal operating characteristics and limitations of different highfrequency devices must be assessed before their use in human neonates
S418	The iron and acidlabile sulfide contents and the electron paramagnetic resonance EPR properties of hydrogenase I bidirectional and hydrogenase II uptake of Clostridium pasteurianum strain W5 have been determined on the basis of quantitative amino acid analyses The iron and acidlabile sulfide values are approximately 20 and 18 atoms per molecule of hydrogenase I and 14 and 11 atoms per molecule of hydrogenase II respectively These amounts are substantially greater than previously reported values which relied on protein concentration determined by colorimetric assay The oxidized hydrogenases exhibit unusual EPR signals that originate from a novel type of ironsulfur center termed the hydrogenase or H cluster which covalently binds the inhibitor CO This EPR signal represents approximately one unpaired electron per molecule in each enzyme with and without bound CO which is consistent with the presence of one oxidized H cluster S  12 per enzyme molecule The two enzymes also contain ferredoxintype fouriron centers or F clusters The EPR signals from the F clusters observed in the reduced forms of hydrogenase I and hydrogenase II account for approximately four and one unpaired electron per molecule respectively We conclude from the iron determinations and the EPR results together with a reevaluation of previous spectroscopic data that in both hydrogenases the H cluster probably comprises six iron atoms Mechanistic models of the two hydrogenases are presented that account for their cluster compositions and the dramatic differences in their catalytic activities
S419	In attempts to increase the specificity of the CA 125 test the ratio of CA 125 and CEA concentrations has been determined in 155 cancer patients all of whom had an increased serum CA 125 The patients included 47 with epithelial ovarian cancer 38 with colorectal cancer 24 with cervical cancer 20 with lung cancer 17 with gastric cancer and 9 with pancreatic cancer The CA 125CEA ratio in serum of patients with ovarian cancer ranged from 30 to 920 mean 251 whereas in other types of cancer the highest ratio was 240 and the mean was 13 All 47 patients with ovarian cancer but only 7 of the 108 patients with other types of cancer showed a CA 125CEA ratio greater than 25 About 10 of the patients with gastric or colorectal cancer but none of those with other types of cancer showed an increased ratio As the predictive value of a CA 125CEA ratio of less than 25 excluding ovarian cancer is 100 we recommend measuring the CEA concentration in all those with increased CA 125 and calculation of the CA 125CEA ratio
S420	Canal walldown technique tympanoplasty was indicated in about 41 per cent of our cases with chronic suppurative otitis media In this series done during the last four years of 576 tympanoplasties 240 cases needed type III tympanoplasty In 145 cases myringostapediopexy was carried out using temporalis fascia grafting over the head of the stapes Tympanocartilagostapediopexy was performed in the other 95 cases by using tragal cartilage and perichondrium over the stapes A comparison between the results of both methods of grafting is discussed Improvement in hearing was achieved after tympanocartilagostapediopexy This method proved to be suitable for those cases which need open technique tympanoplasty
S421	Three patients are reported in whom chest wall tumors developed 19 to 28 years after thoracoplasty and increased in size with time The tumors could be removed operatively with good results All tumors were composed of hematoma and necrotic material and in all cases they revealed foreign bodies microscopically Diagnosis and possible etiological factors are discussed
S422	The purpose of this study was to determine if alcohol worsens arrhythmias produced by nonpenetrating cardiac impact Twentythree dogs were studied Twelve underwent nonpenetrating cardiac impact alone at 12 msec with a contact compression of 2 cm Eleven underwent cardiac impact after having received intravenous alcohol blood level of 197  37 mg100 ml mean  SD Three dogs experienced ventricular fibrillation immediately after impact and died of these two underwent impact alone and one underwent impact following ethanol These three dogs were eliminated from the study All of the dogs had some form of complex arrhythmia during the first 10 minutes of observation the average cumulative duration of which during the first 10 minutes following trauma was greater among dogs that received ethanol No complex arrhythmias other than ventricular premature contractions or ventricular tachycardia were observed after the first 10 minutes following impact During the first 2 hours of observation following cardiac impact dogs that received alcohol before trauma showed more single premature ventricular contractions p less than 003 couplets p less than 001 triplets p less than 002 runs of 420 beats p less than 005 and total number of premature ventricular contractions p less than 005 than dogs that underwent trauma alone Following the first 10 minutes ventricular irritability increased with time until approximately 1 hour and then there was a gradual reduction of the frequency of arrhythmias in both dogs that received alcohol and those that did not In conclusion nonpenetrating cardiac impact in dogs that previously received ethanol was associated with greater ventricular irritability than in dogs that underwent impact alone
S423	We cared for two rattlesnake bite victims who developed platelet counts of 21000mm3 and 22000mm3 Both had only mild defibrination without evidence of intravascular clotting In both cases the administration of antivenin was followed promptly by a sustained rise in platelet counts
S424	The role of early operative fixation in polytrauma patients with long bone fractures was analyzed by comparing length of stay intensive care unit days and ventilator days incidence of pulmonary complications infectious complications orthopedic complications and mortality in three groups traction only operative fixation later than 48 hours after admission and operative fixation within 48 hours of admission Patients in all groups were similar in mode of injury age and Injury Severity Scores Patients with early operative fixation of long bone fractures had significantly P less than 05 fewer pulmonary complications than either the traction or the late operative fixation group No group routinely required ventilator support even with attendant abdominal and chest trauma Operative fixation of long bone fractures within 48 hours of admission in the multiply injured patient reduces pulmonary complications
S425	To examine the interrelations between humoral systems involved in the circulatory and body fluid volume homeostasis of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD we measured plasma levels of renin activity PRA aldosterone Aldo and atrial natriuretic factor ANF in 14 patients with stable COPD who used continuous O2 therapy Hemodynamics blood gases and plasma hormone levels were measured 1 while patients received supplemental O2 2 after 30 min O2 discontinuation and 3 after a 30min period of 96 O2 breathing Plasma immunoreactive ANF concentrations were 196  50 pgml during O2 breathing and were positively related to transmural pulmonary arterial wedge pressure tPpaw r  090 p less than 0001 and to PaCO2 r  057 p less than 002 Compared to normal subjects matched for age and sex patients had higher plasma ANF levels 196  52 versus 72  6 pgml p less than 001 similar PRA 21  05 versus 13  03 ngmlh NS and slightly lower plasma Aldo 98  17 versus 156  19 pgml p less than 005 Discontinuation of O2 while decreasing PaO2 from 70  3 to 50  3 mm Hg resulted in a significant increase in pulmonary arterial pressure Ppa from 29  2 to 325  3 mm Hg p less than 001 and cardiac index Cl from 36  01 to 39  01 Lminm2 p less than 001 and a decrease in systemic arterial pressure Psa from 96  3 to 91  2 mm Hg p less than 005 transmural cardiac filling pressures and pulmonary vascular resistance PVR were unchangedABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S426	From October 1984 to November 1987 34 patients aged from 1 year 1 month to 7 years 7 months with resistant or relapsed neuroblastoma NB group 1 10 patients unselected disseminated NB group 2 14 patients or selected disseminated NB group 3 10 patients received myeloablative therapy MAT followed by unpurged autologous bone marrow transplantation ABMT at the end of an intensive protocol which included highdose chemotherapy and surgery to the primary tumor Median time from diagnosis to MAT and ABMT was 6 months 5 months from last relapse to MAT and ABMT in the relapsed patients The MAT regimen included vincristine fractionated total body irradiation TBI and melphalan Seventeen patients were grafted in complete remission CR five in very good partial remission VGPR 10 in partial remission PR and two in progressive disease PD The acute toxic death rate was 29 The overall progressionfree survival was 29 The median progressionfree survival was 20 months for the 17 patients grafted in CR 6 months for the five patients grafted in VGPR and 12 months for the 10 patients grafted in PR
S427	The use of bovine tendon as a xenograft material in humans is attractive because of its ready availability and favorable mechanical characteristics Previous research has shown that the fibroblasts and some extracellular proteoglycans and glycoproteins not the collagen matrix itself in bovine tendon are primarily responsible for its antigenicity Various attempts have been made to decrease the antigenicity of these grafts A chloroformmethanol CM extraction procedure has been developed that selectively removes the fibroblasts from bovine tendon without destroying the collagen matrix The mechanical immunologic and local host tissue responses to these grafts were compared to autografts and to untreated and glutaraldehydetreated bovine tendon xenografts The humoral immune response to a purified bovine Type I collagen product was also studied The central twothirds of a rabbit Achilles tendon were replaced with a reversed autograft or an experimental graft Histologic examination of one and two week specimens showed an acute inflammatory response to all grafts Untreated grafts stimulated a severe inflammatory response and were almost completely resorbed by two weeks Glutaraldehydetreated grafts were encapsulated Cellular repopulation was minimal and inflammatory response was more persistent than in the autograft and CM groups Inflammatory response to CMtreated grafts was similar to that of autografts The CM grafts repopulated rapidly with host cells The mechanical strength of CM grafts was equal to autograft controls at 12 weeks The mechanical strength of untreated and glutaraldehydetreated grafts was significantly lower Measurement of the humoral immune response to these grafts was conducted in an independent group of animals using an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay A significant antibody response to untreated glutaraldehydefixed and CMtreated grafts was detected at 30 days Antibody titers to glutaraldehydefixed and untreated grafts remained elevated at 60 and 90 days In the CM group antibody titers decreased to the level of autograft controls by 90 days No significant antibody response was detected toward purified bovine Type I collagen
S428	The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship between facet joint osteoarthritis and disc degeneration in subjects in whom both MRI and CT scans had been obtained The MRI scans were used to determine disc degeneration the CT scans to determine facet joint osteoarthritis It was hypothesized that disc degeneration would sometimes occur without the presence of facet joint osteoarthritis but that facet joint osteoarthritis would only occur in the presence of disc degeneration Sixtyeight sets of scans were included and 330 discs and 390 facet joints were evaluated There were 144 degenerated discs and 41 levels with facet osteoarthritis Disc degeneration without facet osteoarthritis was found at 108 levels while all but one of 41 levels with facet degeneration also had disc degeneration That one exception occurred in a patient with advanced Pagets disease Disc degeneration and facet osteoarthritis both were found to increase with increasing age There was no difference between women and men Degeneration at the L45 and L5S1 levels was significantly more prevalent than at the L34 levels while degeneration at the L34 level was significantly more common than at the L12 and L23 levels We conclude that disc degeneration occurs before facet joint osteoarthritis which may be secondary to mechanical changes in the loading of the facet joints
S429	Carotid artery exposure and rupture is one of the most feared complications of head and neck surgery The ideal method for preventing rupture of an exposed artery should be easy to perform safe effective and should spare local and regional flaps for later use in reconstruction Isobutyl2cyanoacrylate Bucrylate is a commercially available compound that appears to meet these criteria Test animals were divided into two groups The carotid arteries of 12 dogs group A were exteriorized bilaterally and coated with Bucrylate unilaterally Group B four dogs underwent the same procedure except that the vessels were bilaterally coated Wounds were dressed twice daily with moisttodry gauze No antibiotics were given Nine of the 12 unprotected arteries in group A ruptured within 2 weeks and one unprotected artery ruptured on postoperative day POD 29 Two dogs healed over both vessels In group B three dogs ruptured their arteries within 2 weeks One dog healed over both vessels Gross and histologic examination of the arteries showed a striking difference between coated and uncoated vessels We believe that Bucrylate and cyanoacrylate adhesives hold promise in the clinical protection of exposed carotid arteries
S430	Unmodified stromafree hemoglobin has been found to produce neurotoxicity and behavioral impairment in rats In contrast a recent assessment of a modified diaspirin alphaalpha crosslinked hemoglobin HbXL solution found normal memory learning and brain histology after infusion of a clinically relevant dose of a 14 HbXL solution The current study examined this potential resuscitation fluid for evidence of neurobehavioral toxicity under clinical conditions Rats were trained to complete a water alley maze had 50 of their total blood volume 30 mlkg withdrawn were resuscitated with 14 HbXL solution 45 mlkg Ringers lactate 60 mlkg or autologous shed blood and were subsequently retested in the water maze Rats resuscitated with HbXL or autologous shed blood survived resuscitation while 20 of those resuscitated with Ringers lactate died during treatment No significant performance degradation was observed in the HbXL rats following resuscitation and no brain pathology was observed at necropsy 10 days after treatment Ischemic brain lesions were observed in three 25 of the surviving rats resuscitated with Ringers lactate solution Renal tubule regeneration indicative of an earlier insult was observed in animals from all three groups A significant correlation between the total pathology in the five organs examined and maze errors was observed p less than 0001 The survival maze performance and histology results suggest that resuscitation with 14 HbXL solution does not cause neurotoxicity as assessed in this lethal hemorrhage model
S431	Nine men positive for antibody to human immunodeficiency virus HIV who developed peripheral nonerosive arthritis were followed up The clinical features were compatible with reactive arthritis but were atypical in several respects the joint symptoms were generally severe persistent and unresponsive to nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs The onset of arthritis was associated with various infections none of which are known to be associated with the development of reactive arthritis HLA typing was performed for three patients all of whom were positive for HLAB27 HIV was isolated from the synovial fluid of one patient No patient had AIDS before developing arthritis but four progressed to having AIDS after a mean of 75 months and two died Arthritis resolved in only one patient The possibility of HIV infection should be considered in all patients with conditions suggesting reactive arthritis Synovitis in patients with severe immunodeficiency has important pathogenetic implications
S432	Peer reviewers are blinded sometimes to authors and institutions names but the effects of blinding on review quality are not known We therefore conducted a randomized trial of blinded peer review Each of 127 consecutive manuscripts of original research that were submitted to the Journal of General Internal Medicine were sent to two external reviewers one of whom was randomly selected to receive a manuscript with the authors and institutions names removed Reviewers were asked but not required to sign their reviews Blinding was successful for 73 of reviewers Quality of reviews was higher for the blinded manuscripts 35 vs 31 on a 5point scale Fortythree percent of reviewers signed their reviews and blinding did not affect the proportion who signed There was no association between signing and quality Our study shows that in our setting blinding improves the quality of reviews and that research on the effects of peer review is possible
S433	Transmission of Onchocerca volvulus at 4 locations with different prevalences of human onchocerciasis in the Atitlan region of Guatemala is described in relation to vector density and infection rates The percentages of residents with skin biopsies positive for microfilariae of O volvulus at these locations were 138 333 654 and 896 The following variables associated with transmission were calculated from our observations the values are presented in an order that corresponds with the above prevalence rates frequency of thirdstage larvae calculated on an annual basis in parous Simulium ochraceum 0 0004 0005 and 0004 estimated daily biting density of S ochraceum 23 24 254 and 1509 flies per day and estimated annual infective biting density based on S ochraceum 0 18 185 and 1101 potentially infective bites per year The frequencies of thirdstage larvae are very small compared with those observed in Africa and suggest that transmission of O volvulus in Guatemala depends on high vector density Locations with low and perhaps tolerable levels of onchocerciasis less than 15 of female residents with skin biopsies positive for microfilariae have mean daily biting densities for S ochraceum of less than or equal to 24 flies and infected residents normally have mean microfilarial densities of less than or equal to 3 microfilariae per mg of skin Stratification of prevalence rates by age group proved useful for assessing current transmission within a village
S434	This study was designed to compare the anesthetic properties of hypobaric bupivacaine with those of isobaric and hyperbaric solutions when administered in the supine position in an elderly population undergoing hip surgery using continuous spinal anesthesia Plain bupivacaine 05 was mixed with equal volumes of 10 dextrose hyperbaric 09 NaCl isobaric or distilled water hypobaric to obtain 025 solutions In a doubleblind fashion all patients received 3 mL 75 mg of their particular solution injected through the spinal catheter in the horizontal supine position The sensory level obtained in the hyperbaric group median T4 range T3L3 was significantly higher than in both the isobaric median T11 range T6L1 and hypobaric median L1 range T4L3 groups A motor blockade of grade 2 or 3 was obtained in 14 of 15 and 12 of 15 patients in respectively the hyperbaric and isobaric groups but only in 8 of 15 patients in the hypobaric group After the initial injection of 3 mL 75 mg a sensory level of T10 and a motor blockade of grade 2 or 3 was obtained in 14 of 15 5 of 15 and 3 of 15 patients in the hyperbaric isobaric and hypobaric groups respectively All remaining patients received 1 or 2 additional milliliters 255 mg and achieved these required anesthetic conditions except for one patient in the hyperbaric group and eight patients in the hypobaric group in whom anesthesia was achieved with hyperbaric tetracaine The decrease in mean arterial pressure was significantly more severe in the hyperbaric 30 than in either the isobaric 18 or hypobaric 14 groupsABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S435	In 11 patients with decompensated cirrhosis and deteriorating renal function the effect of the vasoconstrictor substance 8ornithin vasopressin ornipressin POR 8 Sandoz Basel Switzerland on renal function hemodynamic parameters and humoral mediators was studied Ornipressin was infused at a dose of 6 IUh over a period of 4 hours During ornipressin infusion an improvement of renal function was achieved as indicated by significant increases in inulin clearance 65 paraaminohippuric acid clearance 49 urine volume 45 sodium excretion 259 and fractional elimination of sodium 130 The hyperdynamic circulation was reversed to a nearly normal circulatory state The increase in systemic vascular resistance 60 coincided with a decrease of a previously elevated renal vascular resistance 27 and increase in renal blood flow 44 The renal fraction of the cardiac output increased from 23 to 47 P less than 005 A decline of the elevated plasma levels of noradrenaline 208113 ngmL P less than 001 and renin activity 276142 ngmL1h1 P less than 001 was achieved The plasma concentration of the atrial natriuretic factor increased in most of the patients but slightly decreased in 3 patients The decrease of renal vascular resistance and the increase of renal blood flow and of the renal fraction of cardiac output play a key role in the beneficial effect of ornipressin on renal failure These changes develop by an increase in mean arterial pressure the reduction of the sympathetic activity and probably of an extenuation of the splanchnic vasodilation A significant contribution of atrial natriuretic factor is less likely The present findings implicate that treatment with ornipressin represents an alternative approach to the management of functional renal failure in advanced liver cirrhosis
S436	Fiftyone bone marrow aspirates and biopsies from 47 human immunodeficiency virusHIV infected patients 42 with acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS 5 with AIDSrelated complex ARC were processed by standard methods for smears and paraffin sections Aspirates were cultured for Mycobacteria The sections imprints and smears were examined by fluorescent microscopy with the use of Truants modification of the auraminerhodamine stain Mycobacterial cultures had positive results from 35 Sensitivity of fluorescent staining was 72 and specificity was found to be 94 If the fluorescent stain had positive results the positive predictive value for recovering Mycobacteria on culture was 87 Fluorescent microscopy with the use of Truants auraminerhodamine staining of routinely processed bone marrow aspirates and biopsies is a fairly sensitive very specific and rapid technique for determining the presence of Mycobacteria in bone marrow specimens from patients with HIV infection
S437	An argon fluoride excimer laser 193 nm with a moving slit delivery system was used to perform anterior myopic keratomileusis in both eyes of 24 New Zealand white rabbits Rabbits were killed immediately after ablation and at intervals up to 100 days By slitlamp microscopy four rabbits at day 100 exhibited four clear corneas and four corneas had central spotty subepithelial haze Light and electron microscopy documented corneal healing In the early stages a transient acellular zone in the anterior stroma appeared over a period of three weeks followed by an increased number of fibrocytes In the corneas with opacification focal areas of 20micronsthick subepithelial scarring were present An unexpected finding was transient damage to posterior stromal keratocytes and endothelial cells The endothelium produced a layer of granular material that migrated anteriorly across Descemets membrane Immunochemistry at day 6 showed a marked staining for collagen IV proteoglycans fibronectin and laminin

S441	Tissue pH in the immediate subepithelial layer of rat gastric mucosa was measured using Hselective microelectrodes Exposure of the mucosa to luminal acid 50150 mM caused a significant acidification of the subepithelial tissue Contrary to expectation disruption of the mucosal barrier with taurocholate 10 mM acetylsalicylic acid 10 mM or ethanol 20 volvol during acid 100 mM HCl perfusion promoted no further acidification of the subepithelial tissue but rather caused an alkalinization of the primarily acidified subepithelial tissue When hemorrhagic shock was induced during acid perfusion a profound acidification of the subepithelial tissue occurred even though a much lower luminal acidity 10 mM HCl was used Also taurocholate had no alkalinizing influence on subepithelial pH during hemorrhagic shock but caused a rapidly progressing and irreversible drop of the subepithelial tissue pH The findings suggest that in normal stomach with intact mucosal barrier H backdiffusion occurs during exposure to acid However disruption of the mucosal barrier seems to lead to alkali HCO3 efflux from the mucosa which neutralizes the influxing H thus masking H backdiffusion and protecting the mucosa Yet when adequate supply of HCO3 to the mucosa is blocked during exposure to a barrierbreaking agent and acid increased H backdiffusion becomes again unmasked leading to extensive acidification and ulceration of the mucosa
S442	We determined the validity of cystometric bladder capacity compared to selfreported voided urine volumes measured by the patient at home The subjects included 200 ambulatory incontinent women 55 or more years old who were evaluated with a prospective protocol of home diaries history physical examination and urodynamic studies The mean smallest and largest daily voided volumes and the daily mean of all voided volumes were determined from the diary Comparison of the cystometric bladder capacity with the daily voided volumes showed a significant positive correlation between cystometric bladder capacity and the largest voided volume r equals 04938 p less than 001 Comparison of the mean daily and mean largest daily void and the cystometric capacity with the different urodynamic diagnoses using analysis of variance revealed a statistical significance among the groups p less than 001 We established the validity of cystometric bladder capacity in the measurement of functional bladder volume and that a home diary may be useful in clinical practice
S443	Permanent coronary occlusion produces timedependent changes in surviving subendocardial cellular properties We compared the functional alterations in Purkinje P and ventricular muscle VM activation early 24 hr and late 4 weeks or greater after permanent coronary occlusion in an in vitro preparation of canine papillary muscle Highdensity extracellular 1 to 2 mm resolution and selected intracellular recordings were made in five animals early and seven animals late during stimulation of a freerunning P strand Activation patterns of P and VM layers from ischemic and unaffected papillary muscles were compared in the same animal Average P layer conduction velocity was determined in normal and ischemic regions with the use of a linear array of recording and stimulating electrodes Purkinje activation was altered little in the early phase of infarction while healing was associated with a generalized 25 reduction in P layer conduction velocity and localized block and fragmentation of P waveforms Intracellular recordings at sites of nonsynchronous P activation revealed electrotonic interaction between cell groups At 24 hr small groups of VM were present but with abnormal activation patterns in regions of necrosis with fragmented and delayed extracellular waveforms produced by partially uncoupled groups of cells Local delay and block could be modulated by rate and site of stimulation After healing VM activation abruptly stopped at the visual infarct border marked by a characteristic end potential These studies demonstrate important differences in the functional attributes of the P and VM layers studied early and late after coronary occlusion Alterations in celltocell relationships are likely very important in determining abnormalities of activation in both settings
S444	The gall bladder mucosa is composed of neutral mucopolysaccharide and protein radical containing secretory cells protein radical containing migratory cells and neutral and acid mucopolysaccharides plus sialic acid containing goblet cells The prognostic significance of histologic or histochemical parameters in gall bladder adenocarcinoma GBA are unknown To determine if histochemical acid mucopolysaccharide content in GBA has prognostic value GBA histologic sections from 26 advanced stage disease patients participating in Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group ECOG treatment study EST2273 were stained with alcian blue at pH 10 assessed by a pathology panel for either high greater than 50 or low less than 50 acid mucopolysaccharide content and correlated with patient survival Initial panel unanimous concurrence rate on acid mucopolysaccharide content was 889 Median survival times from the start of chemotherapy to date of death for high acid mucopolysaccharide content GBA was 14 weeks versus five weeks for the low content GBA P less than 00001 The results indicate that high acid mucopolysaccharide content in GBA significantly improves prognosis ECOG recommends stratification by acid mucopolysaccharide content in future GBA treatment investigations
S445	Patterns of growth inhibition of Escherichia coli in the presence of 2bromo2nitropropane13diol bronopol indicate a period of biocideinduced bacteriostasis followed by growth at an inhibited rate The length of the bacteriostatic period but not the subsequent growth inhibition was reduced by the addition of excess cysteine Patterns of growth inhibition were unaffected by catalase or superoxide dismutase The bactericidal concentrations 100 to 500 microgramsml were considerably in excess of the MIC 13 microgramsml and generally produced firstorder reductions in viability Bactericidal activity was considerably reduced by anoxic conditions and by the presence of catalase or superoxide dismutase Results indicate that there are two distinct reactions between bronopol and thiols Under aerobic conditions bronopol catalytically oxidizes thiolcontaining materials such as cysteine with atmospheric oxygen as the final oxidant Byproducts of this reaction are active oxygen species such as superoxide and peroxide which are directly responsible for the bactericidal activity of the compound and for the reduced growth rate after the bacteriostatic period The latter effect probably results from the oxidation of intracellular thiols such as glutathione and cysteine Catalytic oxidation of thiols in the presence of excess thiol leads to the creation of an anoxic state Under these conditions the slower reaction with thiols which consumes bronopol predominates Consumption of bronopol by its reaction with thiols without the involvement of oxygen leads to the eventual removal of bronopol from treated suspensions and the resumption of growth
S446	We demonstrate that human neoplastic B cells Br cells contain a cytoplasmic protein of molecular mass 60 Kd that exhibits Bcell growth factor BCGF activity on growth factordependent longterm human B cells as well as on autochthonous tumor cells This 60Kd protein is recognized by antibodies against a similar intracellular 60Kd protein derived from normal human lymphocytes These results demonstrate that the two proteins share epitope homology Microculture bioassays indicate that neoplastic and normal 60Kd proteins are capable of driving neoplastic B cells through Sphase Western immunoblot analysis indicates that neoplastic B cells secrete 60 as well as 14Kd protein Immunoaffinitypurified proteins secreted by Br cells exhibit BCGF activity in antiIgM or dextran sulfatepreactivated human B cells In addition a doubleantibody immunofluorescence staining technique was used to demonstrate that Br cells express cell surface receptors for BCGF molecules These studies provide support for the autocrine growth model for neoplastic human B cells and suggest that the autocrine growth factor derived from such tumor cells is similar if not identical to normal BCGF molecules
S447	Total respiratory resistance and reactance from 4 to 52 Hz were determined by the method of forced pseudorandom noise oscillation in 20 normal male subjects before and after inhalation of 0200 mg salbutamol albuterol and before and after the subjects were equilibrated with 80 He20 O2 During air breathing there was a statistically significant decrease of resistance values at lower frequencies after inhalation of salbutamol When the subject was equilibrated with 80 He20 O2 total respiratory resistance markedly decreased at all frequencies and a negative frequency dependence of resistance was observed between 8 and 20 Hz Resistance values further decreased during HeO2 breathing after inhalation of salbutamol After inhalation of salbutamol reactance values increased during air and HeO2 breathing The densitydependent decrease of the real part of impedance can be explained by a decrease of turbulence in the larger airways The bronchodilating effect of salbutamol was not influenced by a change in the physical properties of the inhaled gas During HeO2 breathing reactance values significantly decreased resulting in an increase of resonant frequency due to a decrease of inductive reactance It is concluded that an increase in the capacitance of the respiratory system must be supposed to explain the increase in reactance values after inhalation of the betaadrenergic agonist salbutamol

S449	We have previously characterized mutant adenosine deaminase ADA adenosine aminohydrolase EC 3544 enzymes in seven children with partial ADA deficiency Six children shared common origins suggesting a common progenitor However we found evidence for multiple phenotypically different mutant enzymes We hypothesized that many of the mutations would be at CpG dinucleotides hot spots at which spontaneous deamination of 5methylcytosine results in C to T or G to A transitions Digestion of DNA from these children with Msp I and Taq I enzymes recognizing CpG dinucleotides identified three different mutations each correlating with expression of a different mutant enzyme Sequencing of cDNA clones and genomic DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction confirmed the presence of C to T or G to A transitions at CpG dinucleotides C226 to T G446 to A and C821 to T resulting in Arg76 to Trp Arg149 to Gln and Pro274 to Leu A null mutation also found in two ADAdeficient severe combined immunodeficient children was serendipitously detected as gain of a site for Msp I Simultaneous loss of a site for Bal I defined the precise base substitution T320 to C Leu107 to Pro confirmed by sequence analysis To determine the true frequency of hot spot mutation in these children consecutively ascertained through a newborn screening program we sequenced cDNA from the remaining alleles Two others were hot spot mutations C631 to T and G643 to A resulting in Arg211 to Cys and Ala215 to Thr each again resulting in expression of a phenotypically different mutant enzyme Only one additional mutation previously identified by us is not in a hot spot These seven mutations account for all 14 chromosomes in these children There is thus a very high frequency of hot spot mutations in partial ADA deficiency Most of these children carry two different mutant alleles We were able to correlate genotype and phenotype and to dissect the activity of individual mutant alleles
S450	We present a study in which 14 units of AS1 red blood cells AS1RBC were transported by the TransLogic 620 Denver CO pneumatic tube system to determine whether the system could be used without risk of significant hemolysis Using standard hematologic parameters we detected negligible hemolysis and conclude that the TransLogic 620 system can be used to transport AS1RBC This may provide time and laborsaving benefits generalizable to more than 250 US hospitals which presently operate the TransLogic 620
S451	Identification and recovery of transcribed sequences from cloned mammalian genomic DNA remains an important problem in isolating genes on the basis of their chromosomal location We have developed a strategy that facilitates the recovery of exons from random pieces of cloned genomic DNA The basis of this exon trapping strategy is that during a retroviral life cycle genomic sequences of nonviral origin are correctly spliced and may be recovered as a cDNA copy of the introduced segment By using this genetic assay for cisacting sequences required for RNA splicing we have screened approximately 20 kilobase pairs of cloned genomic DNA and have recovered all four predicted exons
S452	Left ventricular hypertrophy which is defined as an abnormal increase in the mass of the left ventricle has become recognized as an important independent risk factor for predicting several untoward cardiac events including myocardial infarction congestive heart failure and sudden death The presence of left ventricular hypertrophy is difficult to detect by electrocardiography but can be accurately assessed by echocardiography Left ventricular hypertrophy can be detected in about 5 of all hypertensive patients by electrocardiography but is found in about 50 by echocardiography Although it is possible to restore left ventricular mass to normal by controlling hypertension with pharmacotherapy several commonly prescribed antihypertensive medications including diuretics and vasodilators have failed to demonstrate the ability to reverse left ventricular hypertrophy Other agents including most betablockers have been found to reverse it Reversal may take 18 to 24 months from the initiation of therapy This reversal may be accompanied by an increase in cardiac index reductions in total peripheral resistance and improvements in the diastolic properties of the left ventricle It has yet to be determined whether these improvements reduce the risk of myocardial infarction heart failure and sudden death However it is likely that some antihypertensive medications may be superior to others in reducing longterm cardiac risks
S453	The authors investigated the effects of halothane HAL and isoflurane ISO on cardiac depression produced by global hypoxia and the recovery of function following reoxygenation is isolated guinea pig hearts perfused with Krebs solution at constant pressure Isovolumetric left ventricular systolic LVSP and enddiastolic pressures LVEDP were measured by placing a saline filled latex balloon into the left ventricle Bipolar electrodes were placed in the right atrium and right ventricle for measurements of heart rate HR atrioventricular conduction time AVCT and determination of the incidence and severity of dysrhythmias occurring during hypoxia and reoxygenation Hearts were divided into three groups control n  20 halothane n  12 and isoflurane n  13 All hearts were exposed in sequence to oxygenated perfusate PO2 530 mmHg moderately hypoxic perfusate PO2 91 mmHg for 30 min and then to oxygenated perfusate for 40 min Halothane 1 04 mM or isoflurane 15 05 mM were administered 10 min before hypoxia during hypoxia and during the first 10 min of reoxygenation Exposure to halothane and isoflurane before hypoxia produced a 14 and 11 decrease in heart rate a 32 and 23 increase in AVCT and a 47 and 28 decrease in LVSP all P less than or equal to 0001 for halothane and isoflurane respectively and no significant change in LVEDP During hypoxia HR decreased and AVCT increased similarly in both groups Left ventricular systolic pressure LVSP decreased sharply with a narrowing of the prehypoxic differences among the groups In the control and isoflurane groups LVEDP increased during hypoxia but remained unchanged in the halothane groupABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S454	RO 151788 a specific benzodiazepine antagonist although it effectively antagonizes the clinical effects of benzodiazepines ie sedation and amnesia can also induce subjective agonist effects such as sedation or inverse agonist effects such as anxiety The purpose of this study was to investigate in seven healthy volunteers the effect of RO 151788 on cerebral blood flow when intravenously injected alone or with midazolam and to compare its effects with midazolam administered alone Cerebral blood flow was measured with the 133xenon inhalation technique and the drugs were administered simultaneously in a doubleblind randomized fashion during the four following sessions placeboplacebo midazolamplacebo RO 151788placebo midazolamRO 151788 No difference in cerebral blood flow was noted between the placeboplacebo the RO 151788placebo and the RO 151788midazolam sessionsalthough midazolam injected alone decreased cerebral blood flow by 30 The sedation amnesia and the electroencephalograph EEG and muscle tone changes observed with midazolamplacebo were not present during the RO 151788placebo and RO 151788midazolam sessions This study demonstrates the absence of effects of RO 151788 on cerebral blood flow when injected alone and the efficacy of this new drug in antagonizing the depressant effects of midazolam on cerebral hemodynamics
S455	A prospective study was conducted to compare the frequency of renin gene polymorphisms in normotensive and hypertensive subjects Hypertensive n  102 blood pressure 168  17103  9 mm Hg and normotensive n  120 blood pressure 122  1075  9 mm Hg subjects were white had similar age and sex distributions hypertensive group 45  10 years old and 52 female normotensive group 44  9 years old and 55 female and similar body mass index hypertensive group 232  26 normotensive group 225  24 kgm2 p  0048 The familial susceptibility to hypertension was defined as at least one parent and one sibling who were hypertensive before age 65 subjects in the normotensive group had no familial history of hypertension Renin gene polymorphisms located throughout the renin gene were identified by using three restriction enzymes Taq I HinfI HindIII For each polymorphic restriction site allele frequencies were similar in the hypertensive and the normotensive groups In the absence of parental genotypes the haplotype frequencies combining the three restriction fragment length polymorphisms were estimated by using maximum likelihood techniques and were similar in both groups hypertensive group 0429 0277 and 0177 normotensive group 0453 0245 and 0195 for the three most common haplotypes A rare haplotype detected by Taq IHind III was apparently more frequent in the hypertensive than in the normotensive group hypertensive group tH 0086 th 0022 normotensive group tH 0038 th 0050 but the difference was not statistically significant In conclusion no association between renin gene polymorphisms and essential hypertension was demonstrated in the present study
S456	Regional cerebral blood flow rCBF was measured during and after a 23 hour occlusion period of the middle cerebral artery MCA in cats with the hydrogen clearance technique The effects of mannitol upon rCBF were studied Transient hypotension during occlusion dropped the blood flow to near zero on the occluded side leading to postischemic hypoperfusion Mannitol failed to modify blood flow during the occlusion period but was effective in preventing any further decrease of blood flow during hypotension Animals receiving mannitol had an improved postischemic recovery of blood flow The correlation of ischemic severity and postischemic brain damage and the effects of mannitol on these parameters are discussed
S457	Risk monitoring for the Brain Resuscitation Clinical Trial II a multicenter placebocontrolled trial to evaluate the efficacy of the calciumentry blocker lidoflazine in the amelioration of brain damage in comatose cardiacarrest survivors posed unexpected challenges Concern arose when monitoring of adverse reactions showed an excess of dangerous cardiac arrhythmias including rearrest in the lidoflazine group To ascertain the cause of this problem and determine whether it was ethical for the trial to continue an indepth review of data was conducted outside experts were consulted and additional data were collected These efforts suggested possible causes for the problem Existing drug administration protocols for blood pressure control were reinforced resulting in lower subsequent arrhythmia rates Thus through an efficient monitoring system an important problem was uncovered and resolved allowing the trial to be completed without major changes
S458	The relationships of two stressrelated intrapsychic manifestationsintrusion and avoidanceto combat stress reaction and posttraumatic stress disorder were assessed 1 and 2 years after the 1982 Lebanon War The sample consisted of 285 combat stress reaction Israeli casualties and 198 comparable control subjects Results showed that higher rates of intrusion and avoidance were reported by both combat stress reaction and posttraumatic stress disorder casualties at the two points in time In addition the level of intrusion tendencies declined with time Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed
S459	The hair follicle provides an excellent system in which to study growth and differentiation Hair keratins are useful tissuespecific molecular markers for these events By comparing a second mouse Type I hair keratin cDNA clone MHKA2 with our previously described MHKA1 we have been able to contrast the nucleotide sequences and corresponding deduced amino acid sequences of the smallest mHa4 and the largest mHa1 major Type I hair keratins Both nucleotide sequences and both deduced amino acid sequences share high identity but have distinct segments suitable for generation of specific molecular probes Comparison of amino acid sequences adjacent to the central helical domains has demonstrated homologous subdomains designated H1 and H2 in the Type I hair keratin nonhelical termini Although there is only 56 amino acid identity in the carboxyterminal nonhelical domains a common sequence TCGPCR has been identified in this domain suggesting a possible common functional role for this portion of the molecule In addition it appears that mHa4 may differ in part from mHa1 by deletion of a segment between the H2 subdomain and the conserved sequence Staining of mouse and human hair follicles with AmHa1 a monospecific polyclonal antibody for mHa1 and AE13 an antibody specific for all Type I hair keratins suggests differential expression of individual Type I hair keratins in both species This supports our hypothesis that distinct functional requirements are satisfied by the multiplicity of hair keratins
S460	This study discusses the current lack of cooperation between family physicians and family therapists and its roots in the different belief systems that influence each profession Family medicine and family therapy have each in different ways espoused a reductionistic view of the systems model they each formally espouse A model is proposed that enables each profession to work cooperatively with the other by recognizing the particular dysfunction present within the family This model is explained and clarified in terms of the interaction of biomedical and developmental crises in the course of the normal family life cycle The purpose of this model is to provide a framework through which the two professions of family medicine and family therapy can cooperate to treat the various kinds of levels of dysfunction that occur within families
S461	Platelets are used as models for vascular smooth muscle cells VSMC in evaluating intracellular calcium Ca2i metabolism in humans This study was designed to determine if agonistinduced increases in Ca2i in platelets occur via release from intracellular stores as previously demonstrated for VSMC Incubation of purified platelets loaded with fura2AM in media containing 15 mmolL Ca2 resulted in higher basal Ca2i than platelets incubated in Ca2free media In addition vasopressininduced platelet Ca2i transients were almost completely blocked by Ca2 channel blockers Thus in contrast to VSMC the transmembranous flux of extracellular Ca2 is the major mechanism in vasopressininduced increases in platelet Ca2i while mobilization of intracellular Ca2 stores is only minimally involved
S462	The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the testretest reliability of isokinetic torque measurements in the involved and uninvolved knee musculature of 20 subjects with spastic hemiparesis An isokinetic dynamometer was used to measure maximal voluntary knee extension and flexion at 60 degrees and 120 degreess Peak torque PT and average peak torque APT data were collected from five repetitions on two separate occasions Average peak torque was defined as the mean of the PT values obtained during each of the five repetitions Spasticity was measured in the involved knee musculature prior to isokinetic testing using the Ashworth Scale Pearson ProductMoment Correlation Coefficients and intraclass correlation coefficients ICCs were high greater than or equal to 90 for both knees for PT and APT at both angular velocities No clinically meaningful differences were found between the Pearson correlation coefficients and the ICCs of the involved versus the uninvolved knee for any testing conditions We concluded that isokinetic evaluation of torque as measured by PT and APT in subjects with spastic hemiparesis can yield reliable results in both extremities
S463	In a previous study the value of conventional tomography was assessed in the diagnosis of 100 potentially malignant opacities on the chest radiograph To determine which of the radiological signs were most useful the radiologists reviewed 82 of the original 100 radiographs independently searching for the presence or absence of 36 signs The five commonest signs of bronchial carcinoma were a mass coarse linear shadows contiguous to a mass unilateral hilar enlargement linear shadows from mass to periphery and an irregular margin to a mass The combination of either two or three of these signs was highly sensitive 95 and 89 respectively in detecting carcinoma The most useful specific signs were lobulation of the mass and cavitation with thick or irregular walls
S464	We surveyed 522 consecutive patients from a dementia clinic to assess duration of driving after disease onset and instances of unsafe motor vehicle operation in the preceding 6 months Among the 333 patients licensed to drive at the onset of dementia the median duration of driving after onset was 286 months Patients with a clinical diagnosis of Alzheimers disease drove significantly longer than those with other dementia syndromes Of the 93 patients still driving at the time of the survey approximately one third were reported to have had at least one form of unsafe motor vehicle operation in the past 6 months including 21 patients with motor vehicle accidents Motor vehicle accidents were associated with use of prescription medications with sedative properties and with lower subjective ratings of the patients driving ability by the informant
S465	A new reverse transcriptase RT inhibitor was extracted and purified from the red alga Schizymenia pacifica The chromatographic behavior and chemical properties of this sea algal extract SAE suggest that it is a sulfated polysaccharide having a molecular weight of approximately 2000000 SAE is composed of galactose 73 sulfonate 20 and 36anhydrogalactose 065 SAE is a member of the lambdacarrageenan family based on its infrared spectrum and products of hydrolysis SAE selectively inhibited human immunodeficiency virus HIV RT and replication in vitro When MT4 cells were treated with more than 104 inhibitory units IU of SAE per ml after HIV infection significant inhibition of viral antigen synthesis was observed Furthermore more than 90 of cells were viable in the cultures exposed to 4 X 104 to 8 X 104 IU of SAE per ml while almost all the MT4 cells in the control culture had died by 10 days after HIV infection The inhibitory effect of SAE on HIV replication was confirmed by plaque reduction assays The 50 inhibitory dose of SAE was 95 x 103 IUml Chondroitin sulfate A dermatan sulfate heparan sulfate keratan polysulfate and heparin also inhibited the RT of avian myeloblastosis virus SAE immediately inhibited RT activity when added to an assay mixture after the start of the reaction
S466	The prevalence of urological symptoms in elderly males in the community is poorly documented A series of 578 men aged 60 to 85 years and registered with one inner city health centre completed a selfadministered questionnaire which inquired about current urological symptoms Many symptoms were common including a lengthening of the time to pass urine 26 a deterioration in urinary flow 30 dribbling 26 urgency 31 increased daytime frequency 32 and nocturia 57 102 men 18 gave 5 or more positive responses to the 13 questions relating to urological symptoms In contrast during a 2year period only 17 men aged 60 to 85 years were referred to a urology department from the same health centre The implications of these findings are discussed
S467	While most foot injuries heal without treatment failure to recognize and treat some can have disastrous consequences The exact mechanism of injury must be determined for accurate diagnosis Many injuries such as plantar fasciitis pump bump sesamoiditis and stress fractures are the result of cumulative repetitive stress rather than of an acute event Others such as injuries to tendons may be chronic or acute The foot is susceptible to numerous types of acute trauma including sprains fractures dislocations crushing freezing thermal injury puncture wounds and penetration by foreign bodies Special care is required to minimize the danger of serious complications when treating foot injuries in diabetic patients
S468	Hypothyroidism in the elderly may be associated with nonspecific symptoms To determine the prevalence of undiagnosed hypothyroidism in residents of a skilled nursing facility we screened 434 male and 137 female residents aged 60 years or older for thyroid dysfunction Overt hypothyroidism was found in three men and two women Subclinical hypothyroidism was diagnosed in 42 men 97 and 20 women 146 Tests for thyroid antibodies were positive in all patients with overt hypothyroidism and in 12 34 of the 35 men and 12 67 of the 18 women with subclinical hypothyroidism who had thyroid antibody testing All residents with newly diagnosed overt hypothyroidism and 54 87 of the 62 with subclinical hypothyroidism had been under medical observation for 1 year or longer The institutionalized elderly should be screened for hypothyroidism because this abnormality may otherwise remain undiagnosed The detection of subclinical hypothyroidism is important as affected individuals are at risk for further decline in thyroid function
S469	The aims of this work were 1 to establish a technique for the sampling of human tracheobronchial mucus not contaminated by saliva or topical anesthesia and 2 to measure its viscoelastic properties After local anesthesia of the hypopharynx by topical application of 4 xylocaine a doublesleeve microbiology specimen brush was introduced into a flexible bronchoscope placed in the trachea The brush was left in direct contact with the bronchial mucosa for 20 to 30 s to allow mucus to collect on it The mucus sample was then scraped from the brush and immediately covered with paraffin oil Its viscoelastic properties were determined by the magnetic microrheometer technique Excluding the time to anesthetize the whole procedure took less than 1 min thus minimizing the effect of cough and resulted in sufficient mucus for rheologic analysis in approximately 90 of trials ie 21  15 SD mg Mucus specimens were collected from 20 fasting healthy nonsmoking subjects 17 of them returned for a second collection several days later Values for mucus mechanical impedance vector sum of elasticity and viscosity at 1 rads were Control 1 141  41 SE Control 2 155  58 dyncm2 There was a large variation in mucus viscoelasticity both between subjects CV 130 and within the same subject CV 55 on different days In 7 subjects mucus samples were collected 15 min after intravenous injection of 06 mg atropine Viscoelasticity in these samples was 708  147 dyncm2 a value significantly different from Control 1 p less than 005 and Control 2 p less than 005 valuesABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S470	The synovitis induced in previously healthy subjects by knee joint trauma was investigated at arthroscopic surgery performed after 370 days Synovitis was confined to the areas of the synovial membrane bordering the cartilage lesion and displayed a varied intensity of inflammation Biopsies were sampled under direct vision from the area of the peak inflammatory intensity within each joint and analysed by immunohistopathology Only sparse lymphocytic infiltration and a slight increase of lining cell layers were found in the biopsies after as long as 70 days The restricted extent and limited intensity of the inflammatory changes contrast with previous findings in rheumatoid arthritis However the arthroscopic and immunohistopathological signs of synovitis were no different
S471	There has been a growing interest by health care leaders in the continuous quality improvement method of quality management This method uses measurements of quality indicators to initiate and drive organizational changes in a neverending cycle of continuous improvement Many discussions of the continuous quality improvement method have emphasized the organizational and attitudinal changes necessary to fully implement the model while deemphasizing the uses of measures of quality to guide improvement In this article we emphasize the concepts behind the measurement of quality that underline the continuous quality improvement model and give examples of how these concepts can be immediately applied to guide improvement in the quality of physician care
S472	Since several studies have suggested that a slight increase in urinary albumin excretion microalbuminuria is predictive of nephropathy in patients with diabetes mellitus we studied the relation of albumin excretion to renal structure in patients with insulindependent Type I diabetes Renal biopsy specimens were evaluated with light and electronmicroscopical morphometric techniques in 48 patients who had had diabetes for 5 to 40 years and who excreted less than 200 mg of urinary albumin per 24 hours Patients in Group I n  26 had normal urinary albumin excretion creatinine clearance and blood pressure those in Group II n  10 had increased urinary albumin excretion but normal creatinine clearance and blood pressure those in Group III n  12 had increased urinary albumin excretion and hypertension decreased creatinine clearance or both Glomerular structure varied similarly ranging from normal to abnormal in Groups I and II but was consistently abnormal in Group III The thickness of the glomerular basement membrane the fractional volume of the mesangium and the mesangial volume per glomerulus in Group III exceeded the corresponding values in the other groups significantly Thus microalbuminuria when present with hypertension decreased creatinine clearance or both indicates established abnormalities of glomerular structure Normal albumin excretion or microalbuminuria without these other functional abnormalities does not accurately predict the severity of the underlying glomerular lesions in patients with Type I diabetes
S473	This report concerns the estimation of the S phase fraction SPF in situ and its value in predicting the malignant potential of transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter Eighteen patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter were given a 05 h intravenous infusion of the thymidine analogue bromodeoxyuridine BrdU 500 mg at the time of surgery to label tumour cells in the DNA synthesis phase The tumour specimens were stained by an indirect immunoperoxidase method using antiBrdU monoclonal antibody as the first antibody The BrdU labelling index S phase fraction was determined by counting the number of bromodeoxyuridine labelled cells in the tissue sections All grade 1 tumours had an S phase fraction lower than 10 The average S phase fraction for noninvasive tumour 12 cases and invasive tumour 6 cases were 97 and 209 respectively Two patients with rapid spread of ureteric tumour showed an S phase fraction of 184 and 223 The results obtained with the S phase fraction were comparable with histological tumour grade and invasive potential The higher S phase fraction may indicate greater biological malignancy We believe that determination of the S phase fraction of transitional cell carcinoma of the renal pelvis and ureter offers a new objective and quantitative assay of the biological potential of individual tumours and might have practical value in their management
S474	From 1984 through 1987 12 pediatrics residents from the Yale University School of Medicine took part in a threeyear program that emphasized four areas in primary care wellchild care developmentalbehavioral pediatrics chronic illness and adolescent medicine Program evaluation included a videotaped interview an assessment of the residents skill in the management of patients behavioral problems and multiplechoice examinations The program residents improved their interviewing skills more than did the comparison residents particularly in the process and psychosocial content areas and also did better in the management of patients behavioral problems There was no difference in factual knowledge of behavioral and developmental pediatrics and adolescent medicine While traditional residency training in primary care may provide the resident with comparable cognitive knowledge such training may not always improve the residents ability to apply the knowledge in the primary care setting
S475	Gallium67 chelated to nitrilotriacetic acid was encapsulated in liposomes composed of various phospholipids and 67Ga delivery potential to the tumor after intravenous injection of these liposomes was examined Tumor uptake of the liposomes themselves and their stability in the serum were also studied It was found that liposomes composed of distearoylphosphatidylcholine diarachidoylphosphatidylcholine or sphingomyelin with cholesterol molar ratio of phospholipidcholesterol 21 could be taken by the tumor effectively and could deliver large amounts of 67Ga to the tumor They could also give high 67Ga accumulation ratios tumor to the other tissues The study of liposomal stability in the serum suggested that the marked 67Ga accumulation in the tumor resulted from the serum stability of the liposomal bilayer ie the stable liposomes in the blood circulation could reach the tumor in large quantities after iv injection These observations indicate that liposomes with an appropriate lipid composition may be an excellent tool to accumulate 67Ga in tumors
S476	The concept of controlling cardiac arrhythmias by prolonging repolarization was first exemplified in the electrophysiologic properties of sotalol It has since been shown to be a property shared by an increasing number of compounds Sotalol has an additional propensity for blocking beta receptors therefore its net effects in controlling arrhythmias result from its betablocking actions as well as lengthening the refractory period of cardiac muscle The properties of amiodarone another class III agent are even more complex The potency of these 2 agents must therefore be distinguished from the socalled pure class III agents which may exhibit a more restricted spectrum of action Available data indicate that prolonged QT interval the correlate of prolonged cardiac repolarization merely provides the substrate for antifibrillatory and proarrhythmic actions relative to the absence or presence of associated pharmacologic properties of the compounds or to the clinical setting in which these compounds are used Thus class III agents might be expected to exhibit a variable spectrum of efficacy as antifibrillatory drugs with an equally variable incidence of torsades de pointes and so induce a proarrhythmic effect An understanding of the mechanisms underlying these differences especially at a cellular level may provide the basis for the development of newer clinically relevant antiarrhythmic and antifibrillatory compounds
S477	A review of the current status of the genetics of Tourette syndrome is presented Over the course of the 104 years since Gilles de la Tourette described the syndrome that bears his name a body of carefully collected described and analyzed data has produced a model of the genetics that implicates a single dominant gene that is variably penetrant in males and females Moreover the locus of action of this gene is most likely in the dopaminergic system of the midbrain A systematic search for this gene using recombinant DNA techniques is under way
S478	A total of 59 patients with advanced prostate cancer relapsed from or refractory to castration plus oestrogen were treated in a randomised trial comparing 1000 to 1250 mg aminoglutethimide  40 mg hydrocortisone AG  HC with 500 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate  40 mg hydrocortisone MPA  HC A significantly higher objective response rate and better symptomatic control was noted in patients treated with AG  HC 31 compared with those treated with MPA  HC 3 The median time to treatment failure was also significantly longer for patients treated with AG  HC These findings suggest a role for AG in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer While both secondline hormone treatment regimens resulted in significant suppression of adrenal androgen secretion the differences in response rate could not be explained by alterations in peripheral blood hormone levels AG in high doses may have cellular effects which require further study
S479	Six subjects with farmers lung underwent double inhalation challenge tests each lasting 60 min using natural antigen exposure Subjects underwent the tests first without and then with protection by a particlefiltering half mask Our purpose was to determine whether and to what extent the use of such masks reduced or prevented symptoms in affected patients Clinical assessment included general and pulmonary symptoms HR temperature WBC count R ITGV VC TLC PO2 DCO and chest xray film The unprotected challenge provoked late responses characteristic of extrinsic allergic alveolitis In the challenge using the mask all six patients reported to be completely free of symptoms Compared with the test without a mask a statistically significant reduction in the rise of temperature WBCs HR R TLC and PO2 was observed Compared with the initial values a statistically significant reduced increase of temperature and leukocytes was demonstrated in the test using the mask Pulmonary and systemic alterations were significantly reduced but not completely prevented by the application of the particlefiltering half mask
S480	Preeclampsia is characterized by enhanced pressor responsiveness to angiotensin II This report summarizes studies by our laboratory to investigate possible roles for calcium sodium membrane pumps and the vasoactive hormones atrial natriuretic peptide hANP and endothelin in modulating the change in vascular reactivity characteristic of preeclampsia Urinary calcium excretion 1 alpha25OH2D3 levels and serum free calcium levels were all decreased whereas parathyroid hormone levels and intraplatelet calcium concentrations were increased in women with preeclampsia Erythrocyte sodium content was elevated while red blood cell membrane NaKATPase activity was decreased in patients with severe disease Preeclamptics also had elevated levels of hANP which failed to increase further when saline was infused or when blood pressure was increased transiently with angiotensin II administration Finally endothelin levels that are reduced in normal gestation were increased in preeclampsia While the cause of increased vascular reactivity is still unclear there appear to be changes in the intracellular cation environment combined with loss of compensating mechanisms both at the membrane and humoral level as well as enhanced concentrations of a potent vasoconstrictor in blood all which lead to increases in vasoreactivity and blood pressure in preeclampsia
S481	A 14yearold boy with a posterior dislocation of the femoral head suffered an epiphyseal separation with reduction of the femoral neck into the acetabulum during an attempted closed reduction He was treated by an open reduction with care taken not to damage the retinacular blood supply to the head He did not develop avascular necrosis and is totally asymptomatic four years following his injury
S482	Posterior pupillary synechiae affect a proportion of eyes subjected to iridectomy with or without drainage operation because 1 aqueous humour bypasses the pupil 2 traumatic iridocyclitis occurs 3 there is immobility of the iris in the iridectomy sector 4 in eyes with angle closure glaucoma closer apposition of the iris to the anterior lens capsule increases the tendency 5 pilocarpine aggravates 4 both in angle closure glaucoma and open angle glaucoma and produces a small immobile pupil facilitating pupillary membrane formation occlusio pupillae Pilocarpine should be avoided if possible as medical treatment at any time after a drainage operation A beta blocker is the drug of choice To eliminate posterior synechiae over a fair number of degrees of pupil say 30 degrees sector iridectomy can be done
S483	Inactive subretinal new vessels SRNVs showing minimal leakage by fluorescein angiography and little progression were observed in 15 eyes of 12 patients with agerelated macular degeneration In 8 57 of 14 eyes followed for longer than 6 months the new vessels involuted and produced circumscribed areas of retinal pigment epithelium and choriocapillaris atrophy 6 43 showed a further decrease in the fluorescein leakage during the followup period average 301 months None of the new vessels organized into an exudative fibrovascular scar Visual acuity was improved or unchanged during the entire followup period in 12 86 eyes and deteriorated in 2 14 Nine patients 75 were 80 years of age or older three 25 were between 65 and 70 years of age These observations suggested that SRNV showing minimal fluorescein leakage particularly when it occurs in patients older than 80 years do not require photocoagulation because they are usually selflimited
S484	The effectiveness of pulse wave monitoring of the big toes was compared with loss of cold discrimination to determine the onset of nerve blockade during lumbar epidural and spinal anesthesia Fortyseven patients scheduled for elective urologic or lower extremity operations were assigned to one of three groups Group 1 15 patients received epidural mepivacaine 15 with epinephrine group 2 12 patients epidural bupivacaine 05 and group 3 20 patients spinal bupivacaine 05 In the epidural groups the mean time to onset of increases in pulse wave amplitude was less than half the mean time to onset of decrease in cold discrimination P less than 005 In patients given spinal anesthesia there was no significant difference The pulse wave monitor seems to be a sensitive and objective detector of early anesthetic effect during spinal and epidural anesthesia
S485	Lymphadenopathyassociated virus type 2 HIV 2 was isolated from 3 patients with AIDS and 1 with AIDSrelated complex Clinical features were similar to those in patients infected with HIV 1 Viral isolates were characterised by hybridisation with HIV 1 and HIV 2 DNA probes HIV 1 and HIV 2 serological studies were performed by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISA western blot and radioimmunoprecipitation assay HIV 2 IgG antibodies were detected in all sera The molecular weights of the most representative HIV 2 proteins were determined by immunoblot Crossreactivity was restricted to HIV 1 and HIV 2 core proteins In all 4 patients the neurotropism of HIV 2 was demonstrated by virus isolation from the cerebrospinal fluid andor by evidence of intrathecal HIV 2 IgG synthesis All sera were antibody negative by HIV 1 ELISA An assay specific for HIV 2 is needed for screening of blood donations and for diagnosis and seroepidemiological study of HIV 2 infection
S486	Positive vitreous pressure during penetrating keratoplasty can be difficult to manage Despite preventive measures positive vitreous pressure may occur and appropriate intervention is necessary to prevent serious complications We describe a technique that may be used intraoperatively to restore a formed anterior segment and to prevent vitreous loss when persistent positive vitreous pressure occurs while attempting to implant a pseudophakos A 27gauge needle passed across the anterior chamber from limbus to limbus just anterior to the iris will stabilize the pseudophakos restore the anterior chamber depth and allow donortissue suturing
S487	A Fourier analysis including the first 20 harmonics was performed on sonomicrometric measurements of regional myocardial wall thickness in eight conscious dogs under control conditions and at four levels of ischemia produced by a hydraulic occluder on the left circumflex coronary artery Systolic wall thickening was reduced from 2647  620 SD control to 2205  573 mild stenosis 1700  586 moderate stenosis 1146  356 severe stenosis and 369  257 30second occlusion values significantly different from each other p less than 001 The amplitude of the first harmonic decreased stepwise from 135  031 to 108  029 mm 090  027 mm 069  024 mm and 043  012 mm all significantly different from each other p less than 005 These amplitude values correlated to percent systolic wall thickening r  0894 p  0001 A phase shift of the first harmonic from 137  11 to 139  14 degrees 150  15 degrees p less than 005 vs control 161  21 degrees p less than 001 vs control and 191  21 degrees p less than 001 vs control and severe stenosis correlated with the increase in time from end diastole to the point of maximum wall excursion r  0662 p less than 0001 These data indicate that the extent of ischemic regional myocardial hypokinesis can be adequately described by the amplitude of the first harmonic and that the asynchrony of ventricular contraction and relaxation can be detected from the phase of the first harmonic
S488	We hypothesize that oxygen free radicals are involved in the genesis and maintenance of volume and pressure overload heart failure Pressure and volume overload would produce myocardial ischemia During ischemia there will be an increase in xanthine and xanthine oxidase and a decrease in the superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity leading to an increase in the oxygen free radicals A decrease in the cellular pH during ischemia would release phospholipase which would in turn release arachidonic acid from phospholipids Leukotrienes and prostaglandins will be synthesized through arachidonic acid metabolism During this synthesis not only oxygen free radicals will be produced but also there will be formation of leukotriene LTB4 which is known to activate neutrophil and hence increased secretion of oxygen free radicals Increased circulatory catecholamines due to compensatory mechanism would also lead to an increase in the oxygen free radicals Oxygen free radicals are known to depress Ca binding and uptake of sarcoplasmic reticulum which would lead to a decrease in the myocardial contractility We have shown that oxygen free radicals depress cardiac function and cardiac contractility It is therefore suggested that oxygen free radicals might be involved in the development of heart failure The use of agents that reduce the amount of oxygen free radicals would be of value in the prevention and treatment of heart failure
S489	Neopterin concentrations reflecting Tcell macrophage activation were analyzed in serum and cerebrospinal fluid CSF obtained from 14 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage SAH Neopterin concentrations were elevated in both the serum and CSF The increase in neopterin concentrations was most marked in the CSF rising from Days 1 to 3 through Days 6 to 9 levels were highest in patient suffering from delayed cerebral ischemia The present data were interpreted as signs of an ongoing T cell activation both systemically and in the CSF compartment following SAH
S490	Patients treated for Hodgkins disease and nonHodgkins lymphoma have a better prognosis than other patients with cancer so may have a lower prevalence of psychological and social morbidity Trained interviewers used standardised methods to assess 90 patients at a mean of 32 months after the diagnosis of Hodgkins disease or nonHodgkins lymphoma Chemotherapy and radiotherapy had commonly caused adverse effects including hair loss vomiting nausea and loss of appetite Although most patients were free of disease and not receiving treatment at follow up some still suffered from a lack of energy 31 patients loss of libido 19 irritability 22 and tiredness 19 30 patients complained of continued impairment of thinking or disturbance of short term memory After diagnosis 21 patients had suffered from an anxiety state or depressive illness or both while 27 had experienced borderline anxiety or depression or both Mood disturbance was positively correlated with adverse effects of treatment particularly those affecting the gastrointestinal tract Social adjustment was less affected but failure to return to work or a long delay in returning to work and a persistent lack of interest in leisure activities gave cause for concern These findings of substantial psychiatric and social morbidity in patients with Hodgkins disease and nonHodgkins lymphoma prompted a prospective study of these patients to determine their nature and duration
S491	Although herpes simplex virus is a recognized cause of esophagitis in immunocompromised patients it may also be the etiologic agent in otherwise healthy individuals Odynophagia and dysphagia are the major symptoms The esophagogram may reveal ulcers in the distal esophagus and there may be motor disturbances as well Esophageal endoscopy may show vesicles ulceration or plaques In the immunocompetent patient herpes esophagitis is a selflimited disease
S492	This article reviews the different forms of ionic channels voltagegated agonistgated and agonist and second messengermodified channels The recent advances in our knowledge of the amino acid sequence of the sodium channel and the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the relationship of the primary structure to the channels quarternary structure and function are discussed
S493	To determine the incidence of transfusionassociated human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection after routine screening of donated blood a pilot study estimated the pretransfusion prevalence of HIV infection among blood product recipients in San Francisco Among the 911 nonduplicate pretransfusion specimens from recipients without a clinical history of acquired immune deficiency syndrome AIDS or AIDSrelated complex ARC the overall prevalence of antibody to HIV was 29 percent 52 among males and 06 among females p  000002 If recipients in specifically defined or possible highrisk groups n  348 were excluded a seropositivity rate of 18 percent 10563 was detected with all the positives occurring in men 10242 41 and none in women 0321 0 This demonstrated prevalence of HIV infection among blood product recipients in San Francisco before transfusion was substantially higher than the known 002 to 004 percent prevalence in the donor population Therefore the population of women without known risk for AIDS is the best in which to assess the risk of HIV infection in patients who are currently receiving seronegative blood transfusions
S494	The aim of this study was to investigate glucose utilization by individual tissues during epinephrine infusion First the applicability of the 2deoxyglucose 2DG tracer technique during in vivo hyperglycemia was investigated in model systems in vitro Epitrochlearis muscle and spleen cells were incubated with 12520 mM glucose The discrimination against 214CDG in glucose metabolic pathways expressed by the lumped constant remained unchanged over this wide range of glucose concentrations It was concluded that in vivo hyperglycemia does not preclude the application of the 2DG method In a series of in vivo experiments chronically catheterized conscious rats fasted for 24 h and were infused with epinephrine 02 microgramkg1min1 which produced a twofold increase in plasma glucose concentration 214CDG was injected 30 min after starting the epinephrine infusion and glucose utilization rates of individual tissues were calculated based on the concentration of phosphorylated 2DG in samples excised at 70 min The epinephrine infusion increased glucose utilization rates by 40160 in hindlimb muscles skin ileum liver spleen lung epididymal fat and kidney although no change was found in the brain Mass action of the increased plasma glucose is likely to play an important role in the enhanced rate of glucose utilization
S495	In a retrospective analysis the authors studied the relation between the immunologic phenotype of Bcell nonHodgkins lymphoma NHL and diseasefree survival The phenotype included immunoglobulin isotypes Bcell maturationdifferentiation antigens of clusters of differentiation CD9 CD10 CD1924 CD37 CD38 Tlymphocyte antigens in CD57 HLADR peanut agglutinin binding capacity terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase the activation marker CD25 interleukin2 receptor and the proliferation marker transferrin receptor The phenotype and clinical data were available for 109 patients Two patients underwent bone marrow transplantation and 15 patients with low or intermediate grade NHL did not receive treatment intended to achieve complete remission These 17 cases were excluded from the analysis For individual markers CD23 expression was associated with a longer actuarial diseasefree survival 50 survival in CD23positive cases was 40 months and in CD23negative cases 16 months P  001 Among the total study population of 92 patients this finding applied in particular to those with a lowgrade malignancy according to the Kiel classification P  003 In highgrade NHL Kiel classification the absence of CD38 or presence of CD24 on tumor cells correlated with a higher degree of diseasefree survival P values 0009 and 004 respectively For a combination of five CD markers associated with stages in physiologic Blymphocyte maturationdifferentiation CD9 CD10 CD2123 the lowest measure of diseasefree survival was observed where NHLs were at an immature stage and the greatest extent of survival where NHLs were associated with a resting Bcell stage P  0006 These statistical significances aside the detailed immunologic phenotyping has relatively little prognostic value when compared with that of the malignancy grade assessed by conventional histopathology
S496	Thymusderived T lymphocytes recognize antigen in conjunction with surface glycoproteins encoded by major histocompatibility complex MHC genes Whereas fragments of soluble antigens are presented to T helper lymphocytes TH which carry the CD4 antigen in association with class II MHC molecules CD8bearing cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTL usually see cellular antigens for instance virallyencoded proteins in conjunction with MHC class I molecules The different modes of antigen presentation may result from separate intracellular transport vesicles containing class II molecules are thought to fuse with those carrying endocytosed soluble proteins Class I molecules in contrast can only pick up degradation products of intracellular proteins see refs 7 and 8 This makes biological sense during an attack of a virus class Irestricted CTL destroy infected cells and class IIrestricted TH guide the humoural response to neutralize virus particles and toxins But here we provide evidence that CTL specific for ovalbumin fragments can be induced with soluble protein and that intracellular protein degradation provides epitopes recognized by these CTL These findings suggest the existence of an antigen presenting cell that takes up soluble material and induces CTL
S497	In our study we investigated 36 outpatients with renal disease 22 of whom were hypertensive In all patients proteinuria was present 430  505 g proteinday and kidney diseases were verified by renal biopsy Blood cadmium in nonsmokers was significantly p less than 005 lower than in smokers We found a positive correlation between cadmiumconcentration of blood and urine p less than 001 R  044 and between cadmiumconcentration of blood and blood uric acid p less than 001 R  044 Proteinuria was weakly correlated with cadmium concentration of urine p less than 005 R  035 Patients with renal hypertension showed a significantly higher p less than 005 urine cadmium excretion per day 160  112 microgramsday compared to normotensives with a disease of the kidney 114  147 microgramsday Our results indicate that cadmium may be involved in the development of hypertension in patients with renal disease
S498	A prospective study was performed to assess the capabilities of magnetic resonance MR imaging in evaluation of endstage periventricular leukomalacia PVL in six children aged 3154 months in whom PVL had been documented by neurologic ultrasonography during the neonatal period Eight children of similar age four premature infants and four fullterm infants with normal neurologic development served as controls A characteristic triad of PVL abnormalities was seen on MR images a abnormally increased periventricular whitematter signal intensity on the first and second echo images of a T2weighted sequence repetition time  20002400 msec echo times  20 or 30 and 80 msec most commonly observed in the trigone regions of the lateral ventricles bilaterally b marked loss of periventricular white matter in these regions of abnormal signal intensity predominantly in the periatrial regions and c compensatory focal ventricular enlargement adjacent to regions of abnormal signal intensity In patients with the classic periatrial distribution of PVL lesions general correlation between the degree of neurologic impairment and the severity of MR abnormalities was demonstrated MR imaging was useful in detecting subtle forms of PVL in cases in which neurologic damage was subclinical
S499	Over the past 200 years a bewildering array of chemical physical and viral agents has been identified that can cause cancer but the mechanisms involved are only now becoming clear In the leukemias and lymphomas it appears that the activation of cellular oncogenes is important The genes involved are present in all normal cells and are often associated with cell growth and regulation When activated they act in a dominant fashion to cause a cell to express the malignant phenotype There is increasing evidence that in solid tumors a more important mechanism may be the loss of a suppressor gene The classic example is retinoblastoma in which the retinoblastoma gene has been cloned and is also found to be associated with several other common cancers including sarcomas and small cell lung cancer It is likely to be one of a family of such genes It may well be that the activation of one or more oncogenes or the loss of one or more suppressor genes or both is required for a tumor to progress from initiation through promotion to a metastasizing malignancy
S500	The goal of this study was to use a functional bioassay to compare muscarinic receptors in two vascular preparations the rabbit ear artery which manifests an endothelialdependent relaxation to cholinergic stimulation and the bovine coronary artery in which contraction is elicited independently of the endothelium Four antagonists were selected 4diphenylacetoxyNmethylpiperidine methobromide dicyclomine methoctramine and hexahydrosiladifenidol to complement previous studies using pirenzepine and 112 2diethylaminomethyl1piperidinylacetyl511dihydro6H pyrido23b14benzodiazepine6one in order to distinguish M1 M2 and M3 receptors All the antagonists produced competitive inhibition of responses to methacholine with Schild plot slopes not different from one with one exception for 4diphenylacetoxyNmethylpiperidine methobromide Schild plot slopes were greater than one in both tissues Comparison of antagonist affinities suggests that the muscarinic receptor subtype is not different between the two tissues despite the different cell types that mediate these responses Furthermore the pattern of antagonist affinity agrees most closely with that found previously for the M3 receptor with high affinity for 4diphenylacetoxyNmethylpiperidine methobromide hexahydrosiladifenidol and dicyclomine intermediate affinity for pirenzepine and low affinity for 112 2diethylaminomethyl1piperidinylacetyl511dihydro6H pyrido23b14benzodiazepine6one and methoctramine These findings demonstrate that currently available muscarinic antagonists do not discriminate between receptors found on endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells even though the ultimate responses produced are opposed
S501	Dextran covalently linked to moieties of gadolinium diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid DTPA for use as a macromolecular intravascular blood pool marker for contrast materialenhanced magnetic resonance MR imaging was characterized by means of physicochemical and relaxivity measurements and MR imaging in healthy rats Dextran labeled with 15 GdDTPA moities molecular weight of approximately 75000 d had a T1 relaxivity at 025 T and 37 degrees C of 1571 mmol1sec1 per molecule and 105 mmol1sec1 per gadolinium atom more than twice that of unbound GdDTPA Osmolality was 300350 mOsmkg at a gadolinium concentration of 001 mmolL Tissue enhancement was essentially linearly related to injected dose in the gadolinium dose range of 001005 mmolkg of body weight Approximate typical enhancement values over baseline for normal tissues at 10 minutes after a gadolinium dose of 005 mmolkg were as follows cardiac muscle adrenal gland and liver 4050 lungs 160200 renal cortex 130 renal medulla 240 spleen 75 muscle 15 and brain 510 Projectionsubtraction images showed that dextranGdDTPA15 remained intravascular for at least 1 hour after injection The prolonged and easily appreciated levels of tissue enhancement with dextranGdDTPA15 at a gadolinium dose less than that routinely used in GdDTPA indicate further evaluation of this macromolecular marker
S502	Prevention of prematurity is the principal goal of all obstetric care Although conquest of preterm births may yet be a distant goal that will require substantial improvements in understanding the pathophysiology of PTD interim progress is possible Increased attention to prematurity prevention as the focus of prenatal care can have an impact now without introducing unproven or hazardous techniques or medication Reproductive health care aimed at the prevention and elimination of social demographic and medical correlates of prematurity can yield results if obstetricians take the lead in educating both patients and society at large about the hazards of prematurity Progress is more likely if a global strategy is used in all pregnancies as reported by Papiernik et al Meis et al and Herron et al These studies have similar messages of hope and caution All reported benefit in decreasing the frequency of preterm births all required substantial and widespread patient and provider education and all required a sustained effort before any effect was noted Main et al showed that these programs are not likely to produce a quick turnaround in PTD rates in all populations progress will be slow Reports of limited success or even failure should not result in abandonment of the goal but rather in renewed and imaginative efforts toward it
S503	To determine the nature of unexplained chronic serum aspartate aminotransferase elevations of a mild to moderate degree in asymptomatic patients we performed systematic clinical biochemical and histologic examinations in 47 individuals who had been screened for virus alcohol or drugrelated disease Serum aspartate aminotransferase levels ranged from 3 to 8fold normal mean 156  7 units per liter for at least 6 months mean 30  6 months Serum alanine aminotransferase levels were also increased but to a lesser degree in most patients Thirtyfour patients 72 had histologic features of chronic active hepatitis including 16 with cirrhosis Ten patients 21 had steatohepatitis and three 6 had miscellaneous disorders Patients with chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis could not be distinguished from counterparts without cirrhosis by individual clinical or laboratory findings Antinuclear or smooth muscle antibodies were detected in 18 of the patients with chronic active hepatitis 53 All patients with steatohepatitis were women and they had laboratory changes at presentation including seropositivity for antinuclear antibodies that overlapped with those of patients with chronic active hepatitis We conclude that asymptomatic patients with unexplained chronic aspartate aminotransferase elevations of a mild to moderate degree frequently have chronic active hepatitis and that many have cirrhosis Immunoserologic findings compatible with autoimmune hepatitis are commonly present Steatohepatitis is the most frequent alternative diagnosis especially in women and it is not excluded by the presence of antinuclear antibodies Differentiation of the disorders is possible only by histologic examination
S504	The relationship between HIV seroprevalence and the proportion of uncircumcised males in African countries is examined to determine whether circumcision practices play a role in explaining the large existing variation in the sizes of African HIV epidemics A review of the anthropological literature yielded estimates of circumcision practices for 409 African ethnic groups from which corresponding national estimates were derived HIV seroprevalence rates in the capital cities were used as indicators of the relative level of HIV infection of countries The correlation between these two variables in 37 African countries was high R  09 P less than 0001 This finding is consistent with existing clinicbased studies that indicate a lower risk of HIV infection among circumcised males
S505	Little information is available regarding the role of soluble growth factors in neoplastic B cell proliferation The authors have measured B cell growth factor BCGFinduced proliferation in B lymphocytes isolated from 28 patients with malignancies representing different stages of B cell differentiation The phorbol ester TPA 12Otetradecanoyl phorbol13acetate a potent mitogen and inducer of BCGF receptor expression in normal B cells was added in combination with BCGF to enhance the proliferative response These results show that many neoplastic B cells are able to respond to BCGF 32 particularly when combined with TPA 63 The response was variable in frequency and magnitude within clinicopathologic groups cells from patients with nonHodgkins lymphoma NHL were more refractory to stimulation than those from acute lymphocytic leukemia ALL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL An attenuated response to BCGF plus TPA was observed in neoplastic cells with high rates of spontaneous DNA synthesis from all histologic categories These observations suggest that some maximally stimulated cells appear incapable of responding to additional exogenous growth stimuli Within apparently homogeneous clinicopathologic groups distinct subgroups of B cell neoplasms can be defined by cellular responses to BCGF The correlation of this biologic feature with the clinical behavior of the neoplasm requires additional study
S506	Photostress recovery time was measured in 30 eyes from 15 patients with chronic open angle glaucoma and 30 eyes from 15 individuals of a similar age group with no ophthalmological disorder The average recovery time in patients with glaucoma was 7047 SD 3539 seconds The average recovery time in the control population was 4197 SD 1734 seconds This difference was statistically significant p less than 0001 There was a small positive correlation between age and recovery time in the control population whereas there was no correlation between age and recovery time in the glaucoma group There was no correlation between visual acuity and recovery time for either group There was also no correlation between intraocular pressure and recovery time for the glaucoma group It was not possible to control for pupillary dilatation in this study However it has been previously demonstrated that pharmacological meiosis will not delay photostress recovery time in normal subjects This is the first report of photostress recovery testing in patients with chronic open angle glaucoma The results are discussed in terms of the pathophysiology of glaucoma and previous photostress studies in patients with macular disease
S507	We have compared the 14Ctriolein breath test for fat malabsorption with fecal fat excretion corrected for marker pellet recovery in 23 subjects with chronic liver disease The breath test identified 15 of the 17 subjects with abnormal fecal fat excretion sensitivity 88 However four of the six subjects with normal fecal fat excretion gave abnormal breath test results specificity 33 While three of the four subjects with falsely abnormal breath tests had alcoholic liver disease the explanation for the low specificity is unclear and may not be confined to patients with alcoholrelated disease We are therefore unable to recommend the breath test as a screen for steatorrhea in patients with chronic liver disease
S508	Auricular pseudocyst is an asymptomatic cystic swelling of the upper portion of the auricle Various therapeutic approaches have been employed with variable success We report our results with nine patients treated by needle aspiration and bolstered pressure sutures applied over both aspects of the cyst for 1 week Treatment resulted in complete resolution with no recurrence of the lesion in any of the patients This procedure is simple does not require an operating room setting and is more comfortable and more acceptable aesthetically by the patient
S509	To determine whether proximal tubule function returned to normal after cessation of active immunological injury in Heymann nephritis we compared kidney function in an acute stage of the disease when antibodies were being deposited on the brush border to a later chronic stage Renal blood flow measurements via a flow probe along with clearance and micropuncture techniques were used to measure renal plasma flow glomerular filtration rate protein and albumin excretion organic ion PAH and TEA extraction and tubule fluid inulin concentration Proximal tubule fluid reabsorption which was depressed in the acute stage of injury returned to normal in chronic Heymann nephritis but both PAH and TEA extraction continued to be depressed PAH extraction was also decreased in isolated perfused kidneys from rats with Heymann nephritis A three fold increase in PAH content of these perfused kidneys indicated that there was a defect in luminal PAH transport Reconstitution of the proximal tubule brush border in chronic Heymann nephritis was not accompanied by functional recovery of secretory processes
S510	In the brains of 21 patients with Alzheimers disease AD and 10 nondemented controls senile plaques SPs neurofibrillary tangles NFTs and three indexes of cholinergic function were quantified in the middle frontal MF and superior temporal ST cortex the entorhinal cortex HEN and the prosubiculum HPR of the hippocampus Control brains contained few SPs without preferential distribution in any of the brain regions examined while NFTs were found almost exclusively in the HPR In brains from patients with AD an inverse relationship of SPs and NFTs was found in the brain regions examined SPs were preferentially in the neocortex and NFTs preferentially in the hippocampus The specific activities of choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase were reduced in all regions examined while no significant change in the density of muscarinic binding sites was observed in any region Numerous NFTs were associated with an earlier age at onset while the presence of SPs was related to the cholinergic deficit in AD Earlieronset less than 67 years AD was also associated with a qualitative difference in the regional distribution of NFTs compared with cases with a later onset In the latter group most NFTs were observed in the hippocampus a distribution pattern similar to that observed with normal aging In AD cases with an earlier onset NFTs were more globally distributed in the neocortex and allocortex
S511	To determine the effect of normoglycemia on renal prostaglandin synthesis and reninangiotensin system activity prostaglandin E2 PGE2 urinary excretion plasma renin activity PRA and glomerular filtration rate GFR were studied in seven patients with insulindependent diabetes mellitus IDDM without complications both in basal conditions and after a 20h treatment with an artificial pancreas Normoglycemia induced a significant reduction in PGE2 excretion 88  23 vs 55  25 ng12 h P less than 05 and GFR 138  34 vs 105  20 ml X min1 X 173 m2 P less than 05 and a nonsignificant increment of PRA 052  048 vs 083  092 ng X ml1 X h1 The results enhance the hypothesis that renal prostaglandins play a role in the renal functional alterations observed in IDDM during hyperglycemia
S512	Outbreaks of abortion and stillbirth caused by Japanese encephalitis virus were observed in swine populations in Hokkaido in 1984 and 1985 Two strains of Japanese encephalitis virus were isolated from aborted fetuses in different outbreaks and the antigenic types of the strains found to be different from Nakayama and JaGAr01 The outbreak of 1985 was in early June the interepidemic period of Japanese encephalitis in northern temperate zones A seroepidemiological survey carried out from 1984 to 1986 in 14 districts showed high rates of Japanese encephalitis antibody in swine sera in two districts A more detailed 3year survey showed that pig farms positive for Japanese encephalitis antibody were detected at the same sites in Hiroshima near Sapporo as negative farms These data suggest that Japanese encephalitis virus is maintained in a distinct endemic focus and has the capacity to overwinter locally in Hokkaido
S513	We studied the central hemodynamic leg blood flow and metabolic responses to maximal upright bicycle exercise in 30 patients with chronic heart failure attributable to severe left ventricular dysfunction ejection fraction 24  8 and in 12 normal subjects At peak exercise patients demonstrated reduced oxygen consumption 151  48 vs 321  99 mlkgmin p less than 0001 cardiac output 87  32 vs 186  44 lmin p less than 0001 and mean systemic arterial blood pressure 116  15 vs 135  13 mm Hg p less than 001 compared with normal subjects Leg blood flow was decreased in patients versus normal subjects at rest and matched submaximal work rates and maximal exercise 21  19 vs 64  14 lmin all p less than 001 Mean systemic arterial blood pressure was no different in the two groups at rest or at matched submaximal work rates whereas leg vascular resistance was higher in patients compared with normal subjects at rest submaximal and maximal exercise all p less than 001 Although nonleg blood flow was decreased at rest in patients it did not decrease significantly during exercise in either group Peak exercise leg blood flow was related to peak exercise cardiac output in patients r  066 p less than 001 and normal subjects r  067 p less than 001 In patients leg vascular resistance was not related to mean arterial blood pressure pulmonary capillary wedge pressure arterial catecholamines arterial lactate or femoral venous pH at rest or during exercise Compared with normal subjects during submaximal exercise patients demonstrated increased leg oxygen extraction and lactate production accompanied by decreased leg oxygen consumption Thus in patients with chronic heart failure compared with normal subjects skeletal muscle perfusion is decreased at rest and during submaximal and maximal exercise and local vascular resistance is increased Our data indicate that nonleg blood flow and arterial blood pressure were preferentially maintained during exercise at the expense of leg hypoperfusion in our patients This was associated with decreased leg oxygen utilization and increased leg oxygen extraction when compared to normal subjects providing further evidence that reduced perfusion of skeletal muscle is important in causing early anaerobic skeletal muscle metabolism during exercise in subjects with this disorderABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS
S514	An Sshaped ileoanal reservoir has the advantage of greater ease in obtaining adequate length for safe anastomosis vs the Jpouch The handsewn Sshaped pouch however takes considerably longer 70 vs 20 minutes to construct than either a handsewn or stapled Jpouch Because of potential necrosis of the central bridge of tissue created between two longitudinal stapled lines in an Spouch the same techniques of stapling a Jpouch cannot be used in an Spouch The authors have developed a safe rapid stapling technique for construction of an Spouch in the dog and have used it with success in four patients
S515	The metalceramic and allceramic esthetic restorations available today bear little resemblance to their predecessors of 2 and 3 decades ago Metalceramic crowns and fixed partial dentures are successful when the dentist understands what biologic and mechanical demands will be placed on the restoration Tissue management and tooth preparation affect longterm function and esthetic success
S516	Extensive crosssectional studies demonstrate a diminution of total body water in elderly and very old subjects These findings are supported by less extensive longitudinal studies Crosssectional studies indicate that the decrease in total body water is mainly due to decreased intracellular water but this is not supported by the findings of longitudinal studies Despite the observed changes in total body water both animal and human studies indicate little or no change in the relationship between total body water and fatfree mass with aging
S517	We randomized 327 blunt trauma patients to compare the open peritoneal lavage technique with the percutaneous Seldinger wire technique The open and closed lavage groups were similar with respect to accuracy and safety There were one complication in the percutaneous group and two in patients treated by the open method The incidence of positive lavage was similar in each group There was one false positive in the percutaneous group and none in the open method group False negative results did not occur by either method The percutaneous lavage method required less time for performance had better patient tolerance and only required one surgeon to perform the procedure Percutaneous diagnostic peritoneal lavage DPL in the hands of trauma surgeons is a safe and acceptable alternative to the open DPL method and actually had several advantages as mentioned above
S518	In the majority of centers orthotopic liver transplantation at any given time involves a team of four the surgeon and the first second and third assistants As a result considerable skilled manpower must be available around the clock Furthermore the presence of four surgeons and an instrument nurse creates considerable crowding around the operating table Although various mechanical devices have been occasionally employed by various teams for the purpose of solving these problems no single instrument has been reported as truly helpful During the past year the Iron Intern a tablemounted surgical robot that replaces up to two of the human assistants during the liver transplantation recipient operation has been successfully employed at the University of Pittsburgh The instrument is easy to use and versatile enough to be satisfactory under any circumstances We believe this device is a real breakthrough in streamlining orthotopic liver transplantation
S519	When Plasmodium falciparum parasites are cultured with some immune sera merozoites are agglutinated by antibodies to form immune clusters of merozoites and prevent their invasion into erythrocytes Within these immune clusters of merozoites several antigens that are normally found in the soluble fraction after detergent extraction accumulate in relatively insoluble immune complexes From mice immunized with these immune complexes we obtained hybridomas secreting monoclonal antibodies mAb that react with various immune clusters of merozoites antigens including mAb 3D5 which recognizes a 101kDa antigen p101 and mAb 5E3 which recognizes a 113kDa antigen p113 Both mAb reacted with antigens at the surface of schizonts in the vacuolar space and at the surface of merozoites before their release from schizontinfected cells Both p101 and p113 were synthesized by mature trophozoites and young schizonts In pulsechase experiments p113 was processed to 100 70 55 and 50kDa products Both p101 and p113 appeared in the culture medium when schizont rupture occurred in normal culture medium but were found in immune complexes when schizont rupture occurred in the presence of immune serum Antibodies in immune complexes when dissociated with acid and used to probe immunoblots reacted with affinitypurified p101 and p113 Antigens such as these which are accessible at the parasite surface and react with antibodies present in immune serum that inhibits parasite invasion are logical candidates to study in the search for a vaccine against the erythrocytic stages of malaria
S520	The effectiveness of elemental nontoxic carbonyl iron in replacing iron lost at blood donation was examined In a randomized doubleblind design 99 women aged 18 to 40 were given placebo or lowdose carbonyl iron 100 mg orally at bedtime for 56 days after phlebotomy Compliance was equivalent for the two regimens Mild side effects were slightly greater with carbonyl iron At Day 56 estimated net iron absorption from therapy or diet or both was sufficient to replace iron in 85 percent of those receiving carbonyl iron but in only 29 percent of those taking placebo p less than 0001 The rates of deferral from repeat donation were 8 percent in the carbonyl iron group and 36 percent in the placebo group p less than 001 and the positive predictive value of routine screening in identifying participants without iron deficiency was 83 versus 13 percent p less than 001 It can be concluded that shortterm carbonyl iron supplementation in female blood donors can replace the iron lost at phlebotomy protect the women against iron deficiency and enhance their ability to give blood
S521	Photocycle and flashinduced proton release and uptake were investigated for bacteriorhodopsin mutants in which Asp85 was replaced by Ala Asn or Glu Asp212 was replaced by Asn or Glu Asp115 was replaced by Ala Asn or Glu Asp96 was replaced by Ala Asn or Glu and Arg82 was replaced by Ala or Gln in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine33cholamidopropyldimethylammonio1 propanesulfonate micelles at pH 73 In the Asp85Ala and Asp85Asn mutants the absence of the charged carboxyl group leads to a blue chromophore at 600 and 595 nm respectively and lowers the pK of the Schiff base deprotonation to 82 and 7 respectively suggesting a role for Asp85 as counterion to the Schiff base The early part of the photocycles of the Asp85Ala and Asp85Asn mutants is strongly perturbed the formation of a weak Mlike intermediate is slowed down about 100fold over wild type In both mutants proton release is also slower but clearly precedes the rise of M The amplitude of the early less than 02 microseconds reversed photovoltage component in the Asp85Asn mutant is very large and the net charge displacement is close to zero indicating proton release and uptake on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane The data suggest an obligatory role for Asp85 in the efficient deprotonation of the Schiff base and in the proton release phase probably as proton acceptor In the Asp212Asn mutant the rise of the absorbance change at 410 nm is slowed down to 220 microsecond its amplitude is small and the release of protons is delayed to 19 ms The absorbance changes at 650 nm indicate perturbations in the early time range with a slow K intermediate Thus Asp212 also participates in the early events of charge translocation and deprotonation of the Schiff base In the Arg82Gln mutant no net transient proton release was observed whereas in the Arg82Ala mutant uptake and release were reversed The pK shift of the purpletoblue transition in the Asp85Glu Arg82Ala and Arg82Gln mutants and the similarity in the photocycle and photoelectrical signals of the Asp85Ala Asp85Asn and Asp212Asn mutants suggest the interaction between Asp85 Arg82 Asp212 and the Schiff base as essential for proton release
S522	Two patients with chronic abdominal pain and fasting hypergastrinemia had increases in serum gastrin of 440 and 300 pgml after injection of 2 Ukg SecretinKABI Both subsequently proved to have pentagastrinfast achlorhydria Intragastric instillation of 01 N HCl suppressed serum gastrin concentration by greater than 60 In both the pancreas was normal by sonography or computed tomography CT scan and at laparotomy in one Both are currently asymptomatic 12 and 18 months later We conclude that achlorhydria may be associated after injection of SecretinKABI with a falsepositive rise in fasting serum gastrin concentration of greater than 200 pgml and that gastric analysis for hypochlorhydria should be performed before secretin provocation testing
S523	The isolation and sequence of a cDNA clone encoding the complete glyoxysomal malate dehydrogenase gMDH SmalateNAD oxidoreductase EC 11137 of watermelon cotyledons are presented Partial cDNA clones were synthesized in a three part strategy taking advantage of the polymerase chain reaction technology with oligonucleotides based on directly determined amino acid sequences Subsequently the complete clone for gMDH was synthesized with a sense primer corresponding to the nucleotide sequence of the Nterminal end of pregMDH and an antisense primer corresponding to the adenylylation site found in the mRNA The amino acids for substrate and cofactor binding identified by xray crystallography for pig heart cytoplasmic malate dehydrogenase are conserved in the 319aminoacidlong mature plant enzyme The pregMDH contains an Nterminal transit peptide of 37 residues It has a net positive charge lacks a long stretch of hydrophobic residues and contains besides acidic amino acids a cluster of serine residues This Nterminal extension is cleaved off upon association with or import into glyoxysomes It contains a putative AHL topogenic signal for microbody import and has no sequence similarity to the 27residuelong presequence of the watermelon mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase precursor
S524	This paper presents an overview of recent estimations of safety belt effectiveness obtained using a new techniquethe doublepair comparison method By effectiveness is meant the reduction expressed as per cent in fatalities to a presently unbelted population that would result if all of its members were to use belts but not otherwise change their driving behavior The doublepair comparison method is presented more simply with less mathematical detail and rigor than in earlier descriptions of it The method is applied to determine the effectiveness of threepoint lapshoulder belts in preventing fatalities to drivers and right front passengers in passenger cars of model year 1974 or later averaged over the distribution of crashes which occur in US traffic The method is then applied to investigate the dependence of effectiveness on a variety of vehicular accident roadway and environmental factors It is reported that if all presently unbelted drivers and right front passengers were to use the provided lapshoulder belts but not otherwise change their behavior fatalities to this group would decline by 43  3 Safety belt effectiveness for drivers is higher in singlecar crashes than in multiplevehicle crashes but does not depend much on a variety of other vehicle factors for example car size accident factors travel speed roadway factors posted speed limit and environmental factors light versus dark
S525	To determine whether there is a prognostic value in the percentage normal sperm morphologic features in a human in vitro fertilization IVF program the authors conducted a prospective study in women with bilateral tubal damage Based on the percentage of morphologically normal spermatozoa the patients were divided into four groups group I normal morphologic features between 0 and 14 group II 15 to 30 group III 31 to 45 and group IV 46 to 60 One hundred ninety successful laparoscopic cycles were evaluated In group I 104 oocytes were obtained of which 37 fertilized but no pregnancy resulted in group II 81 of 324 oocytes were fertilized with a pregnancy rate per embryo transfer ET of 22 in group III 82 of 309 oocytes were fertilized with a 31 pregnancy rate and in group IV 91 of 69 oocytes were fertilized with a pregnancy rate of 12 Probability models indicated that there was a clear threshold in normal sperm morphologic features at 14 with high fertilization and pregnancy rate in the groups with normal sperm morphologic features greater than 14
S526	In 1989 an expert panel appointed by the Association of Teachers of Preventive Medicine proposed minimum curricular content requirements for health promotiondisease prevention including recommendations for timing duration and course sequencing during medical school Making clinical preventive medicine an integral part of a primary care rotation is a central feature of the proposal The panel presents recommendations for using the Guide to Clinical Preventive Services which assesses the effectiveness of 169 types of prevention interventions in both undergraduate and postgraduate medical education Recommendations for incorporating the guide into the undergraduate medical school curriculum are outlined The recommendations include options for using the guide as part of a curriculum in quantitative skills in clinical preventive medicine in a primary care rotation as a health services and community dimension curriculum and as part of continuing selfeducation Recognizing that teaching methods and curriculum structures are varied in preventive medicine the panel designed the recommendations to be adaptable to all medical schools programs The recommendations are aimed at achieving the goal of making preventive medicine an integral part of the education training and practice of physicians

S528	The electromagnetic spectrum consists of radiant energy that is classified according to specific wavelengths Man is constantly exposed to a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum particularly to radiation in the ultraviolet visible and infrared regions The tissues of the eye and skin are particularly sensitive to the nonionizing wavelengths of radiant energy Although both tissues possess endogenous protective mechanisms to minimize the effects of such exposure problems still occur due to the absorption of radiation The cornea lens and retina have been shown to be susceptible to damage from light in the ultraviolet visible and infrared range Part I of this twopart article examines the structures of the eye that are most susceptible to light damage part II which will be published in the next issue of the Journal focuses on eye protection
S529	Coughing induces cardioacceleratory responses under cholinergic control The Cough Test CT a standardized test that uses a series of coughs with electrocardiographic monitoring was used to assess the functional integrity of cardiovascular autonomic nerves In 224 control subjects and 235 diabetic patients heartrate HR responses were compared with four established tests lying to standing LS standing to lying SL deep breathing DB and Valsalva maneuver VM In control subjects HR responses declined significantly with age in a curvilinear pattern Logtransformed indices were used to estimate percentiles The CTHR responses were reproducible and significantly associated with other HRresponse tests Sixtynine 29 diabetic patients had an abnormal value less than or equal to 1st percentile whereas only 2 control subjects had such an abnormality Among diabetic patients age and duration of diabetes exerted a significant negative influence With the use of the criteria of two abnormal or one abnormal and two borderline tests among CT LS SL DB or VM as a minimal criteria for cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy CT and LS had the least overlap between the control and diabetic populations and were significantly better than SL or VM P less than 0005 for CT P less than 001 for LS They were not different from DB We found the CT to be simple to perform reproducible and useful for the assessment of cardiovascular autonomic reflexes
S530	Piggyback orthotopic liver transplantation was performed in 24 patients during a period of 4 months This represented 19 of the liver transplantation at our institution during that time The piggyback method of liver insertion compared favorably with the standard operation in terms of patient survival blood loss incidence of vascular and biliary complications and rate of retransplantation The piggyback operation cannot be used in all cases but when indicated and feasible its advantages are important enough to warrant its inclusion in the armamentarium of the liver transplant surgeon
S531	The present work tested the hypothesis that portal venous bile acids regulate the activity of the cholesterol 7 alphahydroxylase and studied the influence of hepatic microsomal free cholesterol concentration on the enzyme activity Operative liver biopsies and samples of portal venous blood were obtained from a total of 61 patients with gallstones who were undergoing cholecystectomy Fifteen of the patients were treated with cholestyramine 16 gday for 23 wk before operation and 23 patients with chenodeoxycholic acid 15 mgkgday or ursodeoxycholic acid 15 mgkgday for 34 wk before operation Highly accurate methods based on isotope dilutionmass spectrometry were used for assay of the cholesterol 7 alphahydroxylase activity the concentration of free cholesterol in the microsomes and the levels of individual bile acids in portal venous blood Cholestyramine treatment increased the cholesterol 7 alphahydroxylase activity about sixfold from 76  11 mean  SEM to 457  67 pmolminmg protein Administration of chenodeoxycholic acid reduced the enzyme activity considerably to 10  03 pmolminmg protein whereas ursodeoxycholic acid did not significantly affect the enzyme activity 79  22 pmolminmg protein The concentration of microsomal free cholesterol remained essentially unchanged in spite of a 45fold variation in enzyme activity There was a negative correlation between the absolute as well as the relative concentration of chenodeoxycholic acid in portal blood and the activity of the cholesterol 7 alphahydroxylase whereas there was no correlation between the total concentration of bile acids and the enzyme activity It is concluded that the composition of individual bile acids may be more important than the total concentration of bile acids in the portal vein for the regulation of the cholesterol 7 alphahydroxylase activity in humans It is further concluded that chenodeoxycholic acid is a considerably stronger suppressor of bile acid synthesis than ursodeoxycholic acid
S532	Primary encounter with antigen stimulates specific B cells not only to differentiate into cells that produce antibody at a high rate plasma cells but also to give rise to populations of memory cells These cells have many characteristics that differ from virgin B cells including their lifespan When reexposed to antigen memory cells generate secondary IgG responses that are enhanced in rate titre and affinity At present they are considered as small resting lymphocytes which survive for long periods in a quiescent state between each antigen encounter However the fact that an individual may continue to make an antibody response for many months following a single injection of antigen is often overlooked This continued antibody production is probably due to repeated stimulation of antigenspecific B cells and raises the question of whether memory Bcell clones require antigen for their maintenance Here we show that they do and that following transfer in the absence of antigen memory Bcell populations are lost from the adoptive host after 1012 weeks
S533	A 12 aminoacid synthetic peptide NANP3 comprising the immunodominant epitope of Plasmodium falciparum circumsporozoite protein was conjugated to tetanus toxoid TT adjuvanted with aluminium hydroxide and administered intramuscularly in three doses at monthly intervals to 35 healthy males as a malaria vaccine No significant adverse reactions were noted with mild soreness at the injection site the only common symptom Seroconversions against NANP occurred in 53 and 71 of recipients of 100 or 160 micrograms respectively measured by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay ELISA Most ELISApositive sera reacted with sporozoites by indirect immunofluorescence IFA Three vaccinees with the highest ELISA and IFA titres and four unimmunized controls were challenged with P falciparum sporozoites introduced via the bites of infective Anopheles mosquitoes Blood stage parasites were detected in all controls by 10 days mean 85 days range 710 In contrast the two vaccinees who became infected did not manifest parasitaemia until day 11 and the third vacinee showed neither parasites nor symptoms during the 29 day observation period This first synthetic peptide parenteral vaccine against a communicable disease tested in man is safe and stimulates biologically active antibodies These observations encourage the development of improved vaccine formulations which by enhancing immunogenicity may lead to practical vaccines to assist in the control of falciparum malaria

S535	From January 1972 to December 1984 347 consecutive patients underwent open mitral commissurotomy for mitral stenosis Commissurotomy was performed in 86 of 404 patients undergoing mitral valve operations for stenosis during the same period These 347 patients had three different types of mitral stenosis type I mobile cusps without subvalvular changes 43 patients type II thickened cusps with subvalvular changes 210 patients type III rigid cusps with severe subvalvular changes 94 patients Concomitant mild mitral regurgitation was seen in 87 patients 251 and mild to moderate valve calcification in 61 patients 176 There were eight early deaths 23 and 12 late deaths 35 yielding an actuarial survival rate of 946 excluding early deaths 14 years after operation There were 17 reoperations 50 The actuarial rates of freedom from reoperation were as follows 838 at 14 years for the entire series 735 for type I stenosis 889 for type II 840 for type III 917 for mitral stenosis with calcification 826 for stenosis without calcification 906 for pure mitral stenosis and 525 for stenosis combined with regurgitation p less than 005 Postoperative effective mitral valve areas calculated according to the hydraulic formula were 252 cm2 mean at rest and 306 cm2 during exercise in six patients with type I stenosis 221 and 248 cm2 respectively in 10 with type II and 185 and 187 cm2 respectively in 14 with type III Our data clearly demonstrated that open mitral commissurotomy provided excellent longterm results with acceptable valve function and a low incidence of reoperation in patients with pure mitral stenosis not combined with regurgitation even when associated with severe subvalvular changes with or without mild to moderate valve calcification
S536	In a prospective study pleural biopsy specimens obtained with a Trucut needle were compared with those obtained with an Abrams pleural biopsy punch from 36 patients in Zimbabwe judged to have an effusion of at least 15 litres one patient had two biopsies Both instruments were used on each patient the Abrams punch being followed by the Trucut needle There were no serious complications The diagnoses determined by biopsy were tuberculosis 11 carcinoma 12 chronic inflammation 9 and pleural fibrosis 4 one biopsy showed nothing abnormal In 23 62 patients both biopsy needles produced adequate diagnostic material in eight the Trucut needle alone produced diagnostic material and in six the Abrams punch alone Thus diagnostic material was obtained in 31 patients from the Trucut needle and in 29 from the Abrams punch The Trucut needle was useful and safe for pleural biopsy in this series and appeared to be particularly useful when the pleura was thickened
S537	Sepsis due to injuryrelated immunosuppression is generally accepted to be the leading cause of morbidity and mortality following trauma A clear relationship between the amount of burn injury and immunosuppression can be demonstrated but quantitative relationships between the actual amount of blunt or penetrating injury a state of immunosuppression and the subsequent development of sepsis has not been clearly established We have studied and attempted to characterize multiply traumatized patients to identify which components or immune parameters suggest the opportunity to predict sepsis This report briefly reviews the literature in this area and summarizes current work from our laboratory attempting to identify potential markers
S538	Since its commercial release Zyderm collagen implant has been used to treat more than 200000 subjects in the United States for softtissue contour defects and more than 250000 patients internationally including the United States Approximately 3 percent of subjects skin tested with Zyderm collagen experience localized hypersensitivity reactions to collagen whereas approximately 1 percent of treated patients demonstrate symptoms of hypersensitivity at treatment sites Of the latter treatment responses reported since the conclusion of clinical trials with Zyderm 56 percent occurred following the first treatment 28 percent following the second 10 percent following the third and 6 percent following subsequent exposures The data indicate that most patients receive a median of three treatments mean  44 with Zyderm collagen but most patients who are likely to develop sensitivity to Zyderm collagen appear to respond immunologically to the test implant or first treatment exposure Examining these treatment responses 45 percent of the patients reported an onset of symptoms within 10 days and 22 percent at more than 30 days following the last treatment with Zyderm collagen Erythema was the sole symptom in 24 percent of cases whereas erythema plus induration comprised an additional 42 percent Antibodies against Zyderm collagen were detected in the sera of 88 percent of these subjects using an ELISA but no reactivity was observed against human collagen Sera from patients reporting only systemic symptoms were not found to have anticollagen antibodies These data suggest that the relative risk of a hypersensitivity reaction to Zyderm collagen does not increase with multiple exposures since patients who are going to develop an immune response to bovine collagen react with greatest frequency to initial injections of collagen In animal models Zyderm collagen was shown to be less immunogenic than other medical devices which are composed of bovine collagen Specifically comparative studies were conducted in which Zyderm collagen and hemostatic agents were implanted in the guinea pig subcutaneum sera from animals treated with collagenderived hemostatic devices possessed significant levels of antiimplant antibodies titers greater than 640 whereas animals treated with Zyderm collagen mounted minimal responses titers less than 40 Additional studies were conducted in which implant materials were compared in a guinea pig parietal bony defect model and in a rabbit hemostasis model in both Zyderm collagen demonstrated lower immunogenicity than commercial bovine collagen hemostatic agents Histologic results from these studies showed Zyderm

S552	The study population comprises 28 patients with sarcoidosis who all had repolarization disturbances in their exercise ECGs None of the patients had hypertension or known cardiovascular disease and all but two were nonsmokers The mean age was 45 years Exercise test with betaadrenergic blockade was performed within one month of the first examination Persisting abnormal STT changes in exercise ECGs after betablockade were seen in 12 43 patients No significant relationship was found between persisting STT changes and age sex chest Xray stage lung function or working capacity In an earlier study we found STT abnormalities in exercise ECG in 56 of 127 individuals 44 in a consecutive 5year study of patients with newly detected sarcoidosis From this and the present report we postulate that in our region as much as 20 of the patients with newly detected sarcoidosis might have organic myocardial disease possibly of sarcoid origin as shown by repolarization disturbances in exercise ECG If ECG abnormalities in the STT region are present in patients with sarcoidosis exercise ECG with betablockade is a simple way of establishing suspicion of organic myocardial lesions If exercise ECG abnormalities in the STT region persist after betablockade careful clinical followup is recommended and in some patients early steroid therapy should be considered
S553	The acute effects of TNF on the microcirculation were studied by in vivo microscopy in rat cremaster muscle The changes in arteriolar diameter after topical administration of recombinant TNF rTNF 104104 ngml were studied in second third and fourthorder arterioles A2A4 whose mean diameters under control conditions were 643 307 and 148 microns respectively rTNF induced a concentrationdependent vasodilation whose amplitude was largest for the smallest arterioles At the highest concentration tested arteriolar diameter increased by 21 29 and 41 of control diameter for the A2 A3 and A4 arterioles respectively Indomethacin or mefenamic acid two structurally different prostaglandin synthesis inhibitors markedly inhibited the degree of vasodilation induced by rTNF in the three arteriolar orders As regards the effect of rTNF on vasoconstriction in response to norepinephrine vasoconstriction was greatest for the smallest arterioles and did not change 10 min after rTNF administration for any of the three arteriolar orders We conclude that a rTNF has a direct vasodilatory effect which is greatest in the smallest arterioles b this vasodilation is at least partly mediated by prostaglandins and c administration of rTNF in itself does not acutely alter the response of the arterioles to vasopressive drugs
S554	During a hemodynamic study plasma catecholamine concentrations were measured in the pulmonary artery and in the hepatic vein in 18 presinusoidal portal hypertensive patients Results were compared with those in 15 nonportal hypertensive subjects and in 24 cirrhotic patients in good condition grade A according to Pughs classification Plasma norepinephrine concentrations in the pulmonary artery or in the hepatic vein were not significantly different between nonportal hypertensive subjects mean  SEM 271  36 and 83  11 pgml respectively and presinusoidal portal hypertensive patients 273  33 and 84  11 pgml respectively These concentrations were however elevated in cirrhotic patients 408  47 and 256  45 pgml p less than 005 in comparison with the two other groups These differences suggest that increased sympathetic nervous activity in cirrhosis is associated with the presence of liver disease or increase in sinusoidal pressure Differences in plasma epinephrine concentrations were not significant among the three groups of patients However the existence of a significant correlation between pulmonary artery plasma epinephrine concentration and cardiac index r2  046 p less than 001 in patients with presinusoidal portal hypertension suggests that the adrenal medulla could play a role in the pathophysiology of the hyperkinetic syndrome of these patients
S555	Infectious processes in the retroperitoneal space often involve the psoas muscle These infections usually are secondary to other intraabdominal or intrapelvic inflammatory processes but rarely they will arise primarily within the retroperitoneum These primary infections occur most often in younger patients and usually will demonstrate a chronic illness in which the diagnosis often is missed We describe a 22yearold man with a 2year history of symptoms before the diagnosis was confirmed The clinical presentation of the process and pathophysiology are discussed briefly
S556	Chronic exposure of the skin to sunlight results in severe dermal connective tissue damage that is characterized by the basophilic degeneration of collagen and the accumulation of an elastotic material The aim of this study was to identify changes in collagen the major structural protein of the skin in ultraviolet irradiated mouse skin using immunochemical and biochemical techniques Specific antibodies directed against the aminopropeptide of type III procollagen were used in immunofluorescence and immunoblotting studies Immunofluorescent staining of irradiated and nonirradiated mice skin showed that the aminopropeptide of type III procollagen was distributed throughout the dermis in a pattern similar to that observed for type I collagen Extracts of irradiated 5 and 10 weeks and nonirradiated skins were then subjected to immunoblotting techniques Levels of pN alpha 1 type III procollagen measured by radioimmunoassay were reduced in the extracts prepared from skins of mice that were irradiated for 5 and 10 weeks Immunoelectron microscopy verified the loss of pN alpha 1 type III procollagen in irradiated skin Collagen fibers of nonirradiated skin demonstrated normal labeling with antibody directed against the aminopropeptide of type III procollagen In contrast collagen fibers of 10 week irradiated skin failed to label with this antibody The pN alpha 1 type III collagen is known to coat type I collagen fibers of normal skin Therefore its absence from the surface of type I collagen fibers of irradiated skin may play a role in the development of the elastotic material
S557	It has been suggested that a number of peptides may be involved in the transmission of pain In order to evaluate the possible role of peptides in the development of headache we have in the present study examined the presence of nerve fibres containing neuropeptide Y NPY vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP substance P SP and calcitonin generelated peptide CGRP in human temporal and occipital tissues In the skin delicate VIP SP and CGRP fibres occur beneath the epidermis sometimes running into the folds of the dermal ridges In deeper layers of the dermis small blood vessels are occasionally surrounded by single nerve fibres containing NPY VIP SP and CGRP Large temporal and occipital arteries are surrounded by a meshwork of such fibres In addition NPY and VIP fibres are seen around sweat glands and hair follicles Smooth muscle bundles in the dermis are surrounded by VIP fibres whereas the temporal muscle per se is devoid of such fibres
S558	A review of 1415 patients without distant metastasis from the Intergroup Rhabdomyosarcoma Study IRS I and II revealed an overall 10 incidence of identified lymphatic spread at diagnosis whereas 81 of 592 children with localized rhabdomyosarcoma who had grossly complete resection and therefore with more complete pathologic data had histologically proven lymphatic spread 14 The percentage of patients in this latter group with nodal metastases was highest for the prostate 41 paratesticular sites 26 and genitourinary sites overall 24 Sites with a small percentage of proven lymphatic involvement were the orbit 0 nonorbital head and neck sites 7 and truncal sites 3 whereas the percentage of patients with nodal metastases from extremity lesions was 12 The primary tumor mean diameter was significantly larger in the group with nodal metastases but there was no evidence of a relationship between lymphatic spread and age sex or histologic subtype Patients with lymph node metastases who had resection had a poorer survival rate logrank P value  0001 with a 3year survival estimate of 54 compared with 78 for patients without lymphatic metastases Patients with extremity lesions and positive lymph nodes also did poorly when compared with patients with normal nodes P  0006 and a similar observation was made for patients with paratesticular sarcoma P  006
S559	Urinary tract infections in association with ureteral reflux or dysperistalsis may lead to invasive renal parenchymal infection and residual scarring reflux nephropathy Such infections in infants are often not diagnosed during the acute phase Late sequelae of reflux nephropathy include hypertension proteinuria or chronic renal failure The latter may eventuate in the subset of patients with urinary tract infection and unilateral reflux extending to a solitary kidney or bilateral reflux Proteinuria may herald the inexorable progression of glomerular sclerosis in patients destined to progress to endstage renal disease despite the absence of further recurrences of urinary tract infections The mechanism of progression is probably similar to that occurring in other forms of chronic diffuse parenchymal renal disease which all have similar alterations in glomerular hemodynamics an increase in glomerular capillary flow pressure and filtration The consequent hyperfiltration per nephron may be related to the level of dietary protein intake or to some derivative of the protein load Hyperfiltration appears to recapitulate the presumed renal hemodynamic response to the relatively high level of episodic meat consumption by paleolithic huntergatherers A prudent therapeutic intervention in children with progressive reflux nephropathy may be a proportional reduction in protein intake
S560	Slime isolated after growth of four strains of coagulasenegative staphylococci on chemically defined medium plus agar was rich in galactose However when sterile agar plates were extracted with saline highmolecularweight material with similar properties was obtained that also was galactoserich Most of the dry weight attributed to slime and probably all the galactose originated from agar Slime isolated by gel and ionexchange chromatography from liquid culture in the same medium contained glycerol phosphate glucose no galactose glucosamine alanine uronate an unidentified component and protein Separation of protein from carbohydrate was achieved by affinity chromatography 14Cglucose in the medium labeled the carbohydrate polymer 14Camino acids chiefly labeled extracellular proteins Slime from bacteria grown on medium solidified with silica gel or on dialysis membrane above an agar surface showed essentially the same composition and behavior after purification as the material isolated from liquid culture
S561	The von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis NF1 gene has been localized to the pericentromeric region of chromosome 17 We have screened six multigenerational families with multiple tightly linked markers to aid in mapping this region of the chromosome More than 150 members in six families were typed with probes including HHH202 D17Z1 EW203 EW206 EW207 EW301 pA1041 D17S37 and D17S36 Twopoint lod scores for NF1 versus all markers were calculated HHH202 demonstrated the tightest linkage to NF1 with theta  0 z  386 95 confidence limits CL of theta  013 suggesting that HHH202 be considered as a potential candidate marker for use in carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis Pairwise markertomarker lod scores were used in examining the most likely order of subsets of the markers Of those tested the most likely order was pterpA1041EW301D17Z1HHH202NF1E W206EW207EW203qter In addition we have ascertained an NF1 x NF1 halfcousin mating in which there are four affected family members who are potentially homozygous for the disease gene Two of these four individuals have been sampled and typed for marker loci When their D17Z1 genotypes are considered the probability that both these individuals are heterozygous is 85
S562	Twohundred eighty angiographic studies performed for suspected acute arterial trauma were reviewed to evaluate the relationship between the clinical findings and arterial injury Extremity injury occurred in 237 cases The proximity of a penetrating injury or a fracture to a major vascular structure was the sole indication for angiographic study in 136 No major arterial injury was discovered in either group Exclusion of these patients would have improved the extremity angiographic yield from 25 to 58 while missing no patients with major arterial injury We conclude based on the negligible yield that clinical observation of these patients is a safe alternative if adequate followup is assured elective angiography may be performed if followup is questionable Nineteen of 20 95 patients with an absent distal pulse and clinical signs of extremity ischemia had a major arterial injury All extremity arterial injuries occurred within 5 cm of bullet fragments bone fragments entrance wound or exit wound Given the virtual assurance of finding major arterial injury patients with unifocal injury and a threatened limb may proceed directly to the operating room to minimize ischemic time
S563	Nitrofurantoin is an antimicrobial agent that causes nonimmune hemolytic anemia in susceptible populations and produces oxidant stress and cellular damage by mechanisms that differ from those associated with oxidants such as phenylhydrazine which has been shown to stimulate proteolysis in red cells Goldberg and Boches 1982 Thus a study of the effects of nitrofurantoin on proteolysis in normal human red cells and red cell hemolysate has been conducted Nitrofurantoin produced greater than a 3 and an approximately 5fold increase in the rate of tyrosine release from red cells at 100 and 800 microM respectively compared with untreated red cells In hemolysates nitrofurantoin also effectively increased proteolysis with a 24 and 40fold increase in the rate of tyrosine release monitored at 100 and 800 microM respectively relative to controls Stimulation of proteolysis by nitrofurantoin occurred linearly with time and with hematocrit over the range 525 The rate of nitrofurantoinstimulated proteolysis varied with glucose concentration in the incubation medium with a 2fold increase in activity monitored between 2 and 10 mM glucose Inhibitors of flavoprotein activity electron transport such as 2AMP and NADP decreased nitrofurantoinenhanced proteolysis in red cells to control levels whereas methylene blue provided only a slight increase in proteolysis and an anaerobic environment N2 stimulated significantly the rate of tyrosine production Although Nacetylcysteine protected against the stimulation of proteolysis produced by 10 microM nitrofurantoin this protective effect was diminished at higher concentrations of drugABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S564	There are some children whose parents believe them to be unusually susceptible to medical or developmental problemsvulnerabledespite a lack of objective evidence of any difficulty The vulnerable child syndrome refers to a constellation of behaviors that are thought to develop as a result of this excessive parental anxiety and subsequent difficulties in limit setting In this study the sense of vulnerability expressed by mothers concerning their healthy 3yearold children is explored children born prematurely and with considerable neonatal morbidity are compared with children born at fullterm Sense of vulnerability is assessed through the use of a simple instrument the use and validity of which are described Mothers of premature infants described a significantly greater sense of vulnerability concerning their children than did mothers of fullterm infants Mothers with more education described a greater sense of vulnerability than did less welleducated mothers although mothers who claimed greater wellbeing and marital satisfaction described a lesser sense of vulnerability Mothers with a greater sense of vulnerability concerning their children also reported more behavior problems especially in the sphere of discipline peer relationships and selfcontrol and in internalizing and somatic symptoms Pediatricians can intervene in the development of the vulnerable child syndrome by recognizing those children at special risk and helping their parents to nurture their health and independence
S565	Immunoglobulin Ig variable V region genes are assembled in precursor B preB lymphocytes from multiple germline segments The heavychain Vregion gene is composed of variable VH diversity D and joining JH segments kappa K and lambda lambda lightchain Vregion genes have analogous VL and JL segments Assembly of Ig Vgene segments as well as those of the highly related Tcell receptor is regulated at several levels and shows both stage and tissue specificity for example Ig heavychain Vgene assembly precedes that of Ig light chains during Bcell differentiation Joining of all classes of Vgene segments involves conserved recognition sequences that are probably targets for a common recombinase Evidence has been presented suggesting that rearrangement of specific classes of segments is regulated by modulation of their accessibility to the recombinase To elucidate mechanisms which control Vregion gene assembly we have investigated the effect of flanking gene expression on the frequency at which introduced Vgene segments are assembled in preB cell lines Our findings suggest that transcription may play a direct role in the regulation of immunoglobulin Vgene assembly
S566	Low income families were interviewed to determine factors related to the number of family food servings per week A multiple regression model indicated that participation in WIC supplemental food program for women infants and children household size and number of different income sources were associated with more family food servings per week Number of food servings per week decreased the last week of the month most often in families with younger members
S567	We investigated the proposition that adaptive cytoprotection enhanced gastric mucosal integrity caused by exposure to 20 ethanol in rats is mediated by endogenous prostaglandin synthesis Experiments were performed both without and with indomethacin sufficient to inhibit ex vivo release of prostaglandin E2 by 56  9 25 mgkg or 86  4 10 mgkg Twenty percent ethanol significantly reduced both macroscopic and histologic signs of injury caused by subsequent exposure to 100 ethanol whether or not the rats were pretreated with indomethacin Twenty percent ethanol itself caused extensive superficial disruption of the surface epithelium so that about half of the mucosa was covered by desquamated debris but did not stimulate prostaglandin release We conclude that adaptive cytoprotection still occurs after doses of indomethacin sufficient to cause a profound depression of prostaglandin E2 release The possibility that it could be due to formation of a protective covering of surface debris is worth further investigation
S568	The effects of oxalate on kidney mitochondria were evaluated in vitro to test whether oxalate exposure leads to derangements in mitochondrial function that could in turn promote the formation of kidney stones Our previous studies demonstrated that oxalate is transported across the mitochondrial membrane via the dicarboxylate carrier The present studies indicated that oxalate competitively inhibits the uptake and oxidation of exogenous malate and succinate in isolated mitochondria but has no effect on mitochondrial respiration in the presence of a mixture of glutamate plus malate or glutamate plus pyruvate Oxalate attenuates the increase in mitochondrial respiration produced by the uncoupler CCCP or by the Ca2 ionophore A23187 and the latter effect is more pronounced in kidney than in liver mitochondria The apparent Ki of oxalate for the response to Ca2 ionophore is 19  03 mM in kidney and 61  02 mM in liver mitochondria Similarly the ability of oxalate to attenuate calciuminduced swelling of mitochondria is more dramatic in kidney than in liver mitochondria apparent KiS of 17  01 and 182  07 mM respectively Oxalate has no effect on the rate of calcium uptake by energized mitochondria or on the rate of ruthenium redinsensitive calcium efflux from mitochondria in either tissue The above findings indicate that oxalate interacts with the inner mitochondrial membrane or with processes controlling membrane integrity to a greater extent in kidney than liver mitochondria The effects of oxalate on membrane permeability or integrity may be more important than its effects on mitochondrial energy production or calcium sequestration in the pathogenesis of calcium oxalate microlith formation in the kidney
S569	A myriad of materials have been used for reestablishing continuity of the orbital floor following blunt facial trauma Traditionally autogenous grafts have been the material of choice for orbital floor reconstruction however alloplastic materials have gained popularity because of their availability and ease of use A large clinical experience with longterm treatment results has never been reported for any substance used in orbital floor reconstruction The purpose of this study was to review our longterm treatment results using Teflon for orbital floor reconstruction following blunt trauma with emphasis on the incidence of infection extrusion and implant displacement This report presents a 20year review of 230 Teflon implants for reconstruction of traumatic orbital floor defects With a mean followup period of 30 months there was only one implant infection and no complications of extrusion or implant displacement These findings support the use of Teflon as a safe and effective material for the reconstruction of orbital floor defects following blunt facial trauma
S570	Experiments were conducted in normal healthy volunteers to investigate whether factors other than the intragastric pressure induced by tonic contraction of the gastric fundus could regulate the gastric emptying of liquids The emptying of solutions of different osmolality and composition from the stomach was measured while maintaining the intragastric pressure constant with a barostat system that employed an external reservoir Preliminary experiments showed a linear relationship between intragastric pressure and emptying rate but indicated that a normal intragastric pressure of 7 cm water would be insufficient by itself to maintain normal emptying When intragastric pressure was maintained at 20 cm water an isotonic solution of 30 mM glucose in saline 278 mosmkg emptied at a rate of 499  05 mlmin mean  SEM N  11 Milk 284 mosmkg and a hyperosmolar solution of 30 mM glucose in saline 586 mosmkg significantly reduced the emptying rate These results suggest that factors other than the intragastric pressure induced by fundic contraction regulate the rate at which liquids empty from the stomach and that the slower emptying of hyperosmotic solutions or solutions containing fat could be brought about in part either by an increased resistance of the pylorus and possibly the duodenum or a reduction in the effectiveness of an antroduodenal pump
S571	One hundred sixtytwo gestational trophoblastic tumors GTT were treated at the Institute GustaveRoussy Villejuif France from 1975 to 1985 Sustained complete remission CR was obtained in 146 patients 90 All 97 patients with no histologic diagnosis of choriocarcinoma were cured including 19 patients considered at high risk initially Among 65 histologic chariocarcinoma patients 16 died CR 755 including seven initially nonmetastatic patients Using a univariate analysis all factors tested in the whole group of patients were more or less significant except for age and parity However when the same variables were tested in patients considered at high risk initially only three factors were statistically significant Those three factors were the only ones associated with a statistically significant higher relative death risk RR on multivariate analysis and are as follows an antecedent nonmolar pregnancy RR  43 P less than 001 initial presentation with more than one metastatic organ RR  74 P less than 001 and primary resistance to single agent RR  188 P less than 00001 or multiagent chemotherapy RR  261 P less than 00001 It seems that those three factors together with a histologic diagnosis of choriocarcinoma are the prognostic factors that discriminate patients with unfavorable outcomes among the highrisk group
S572	Behavioural studies have revealed that animals can resolve temporal disparities in the microsecond range This resolution is far superior to that of individual receptors and it must therefore be achieved through central neuronal mechanisms It is unclear however whether such sensitivity ever emerges at the level of single neurons or whether it is apparent only at the behavioural level through the collective action of many lesssensitive neurons We have found that single neurons in the prepacemaker nucleus of a weakly electric fish are sensitive to temporal disparities as small as 1 microsecond the highest temporal sensitivity ever observed at the singleneuron level The remarkable temporal resolution of these prepacemaker neurons results from a high degree of spatial convergence of afferent inputs These neurons represent the final elements of a sensory hierarchy and directly control the jamming avoidance response by which these fish regulate the frequency of their electric organ discharges
S573	Although the majority of human infants are breastfed for the first few months of life there is a paucity of information regarding the sensory qualities of human milk and how these qualities are affected by maternal diet The present study investigated the effects of garlic ingestion by the mother on the odor of her breast milk and the suckling behavior of her infant Evaluation of the milk samples by a sensory panel revealed garlic ingestion significantly and consistently increased the perceived intensity of the milk odor this increase in odor intensity was not apparent 1 hour after ingestion peaked in strength 2 hours after ingestion and decreased thereafter That the nursling detected these changes in mothers milk is suggested by the finding that infants were attached to the breast for longer periods of time and sucked more when the milk smelled like garlic There was a tendency for infants to ingest more milk as well the lack of a significant effect may be due to the inherent limitations on the total amount of milk available to the infant
S574	The strategy of assigning a surrogate phenotype defined as the presence of antinuclear andor antismooth muscle antibodies to diseasefree first degree relatives of index cases was used to search for a postulated disease susceptibility gene in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis In addition to determining circulating autoantibody status 10 patients 51 firstdegree relatives and 6 spouses of index chronic active hepatitis patients each ascertained by the single patient were genotyped for HLA A B and DR loci and immunoglobulin allotype G1m G2m G3m and A2m loci haplotypes Among the 10 chronic active hepatitis patients 6 had HLA haplotypes B8 and DR3 and 3 of these patients had in addition the immunoglobulin allotype haplotype Gm axg Circulating autoantibodies defining the surrogate phenotype was found in 39 of the firstdegree relatives However segregation analysis offered no support for either single autosomal dominant or recessive inheritance for the autoantibodypositive phenotype Linkage between the postulated disease susceptibility locus and either the HLA Chromosome 6 or immunoglobulin Chromosome 14 locus was excluded by several analyses Furthermore logistic regression indicated that neither immunogenetic marker was statistically associated with autoantibody positively in these families Therefore despite the occurrence of autoantibody positivity in firstdegree relatives of autoimmune chronic active hepatitis patients we found no evidence that this trait has a simple genetic basis or that it is an alternative manifestation of a postulated disease susceptibility gene for chronic active hepatitis
S575	Aspartate aminotransferase AST can exist as a macroenzyme by forming a complex with an immunoglobulin This immunoglobulincomplexed macromolecule can cause an elevation in serum AST activity which may be detected on routine blood chemistry analysis and erroneously considered to indicate the presence of liver disease Clinicians should be aware of this phenomenon so patients are not subjected to unnecessary procedures In patients with unexplained AST elevation liver and muscle disease can be biochemically excluded by the finding of normal serum levels of alanine aminotransferase and creatine kinase The presence of macroAST can be determined by exclusion chromatography electrophoresis and activation assays with pyridoxal 5phosphate The elevated AST values can persist for many years
S576	We evaluated the use of a needle catheter jejunostomy in 83 consecutive patients who underwent complicated abdominal operations We used the needle catheter jejunostomy to deliver immediate postoperative nutrition mean 1700 kcalday in 66 patients for a range of 4 to 80 days In addition the needle catheter jejunostomy was used to provide all maintenance fluid and electrolyte needs and to administer almost all required medications No serious complications were related to use of the needle catheter jejunostomy although easily controlled diarrhea occurred in 16 patients 19 We concluded that the needle catheter jejunostomy is a safe and costeffective means of delivering postoperative nutrition fluid and electrolytes and most medications in selected patients undergoing highrisk abdominal operations
S577	From a cohort of patients referred for elective transluminal coronary angioplasty a subset of patients was evaluated to determine whether revascularization using coronary angioplasty could salvage chronically ischemic myocardium Reversible chronic ischemic left ventricular dysfunction was identified by a severe wall motion abnormality at rest and at least one of the following 1 persistent angina pectoris 2 postextrasystolic ventricular contraction potentiation of motion in the asynergic zone on baseline ventriculogram and 3 thallium201 uptake in the asynergic zone Twelve patients were identified as having reversible chronic ischemia and underwent coronary angioplasty Their mean age was 63  11 years and duration of symptoms 83  97 weeks Immediate pre and postangioplasty left ventriculograms were obtained Regional wall motion was analyzed using a radial axis model and global ejection fraction was calculated After angioplasty tension development heart ratesystolic pressure product increased in the absence of an increase in left ventricular enddiastolic pressure Global ejection fraction increased from 46  20 to 62  19 p less than 0005 The percent of left ventricular diastolic perimeter showing asynergy decreased from 29  11 to 10  13 p less than 0005 During followup ranging from 6 to 51 months sudden death occurred in one patient who had had no improvement in wall motion after angioplasty repeat angioplasty was performed in three patients and eight patients remained asymptomatic Application of easily obtainable clinical data identifies a subset of patients with chronically ischemic myocardium Coronary angioplasty in such patients is useful in salvaging hibernating myocardium
S578	It has been known for some years that a partial deglycosylation of transferrin occurs in the sera of alcohol abusers Different methods have been proposed in order to evaluate this carbohydratedeficient fraction of serum transferrin Chromatofocusing or isoelectric focusing followed by direct immunofixation have been used until now Recently a new method called the carbohydratedeficient transferrin CDT test based on ionexchange chromatography has been developed by Stibler et al Alcohol Clin Exp Res 10535544 1986 Here we compare this new method with results obtained using our Tf index determination method The upper limit of normal values was set to the 90th percentile of the values observed in a reference population The population under investigation consisted of 50 healthy volunteers and 160 alcohol abusers whose ethanol consumption was evaluated through a questionnaire Sensitivity and specificity of the CDT test have been found higher than 076 and 090 respectively The correlation between both methods was 0794 a satisfactory result considering that the CDT test and the Tf index do not exactly measure the same part of the carbohydratedeficient transferrin In a population of 23 patients with liver diseases not related to alcohol abuse no abnormal CDT value was observed We can conclude from these results that the CDT test now seems to be the best test to detect alcohol abusers
S579	A 42kDa glycoprotein isolated from chicken brain referred to as acetylcholine receptorinducing activity ARIA that stimulates the rate of incorporation of acetylcholine receptors into the surface of chicken myotubes may play a role in the nerveinduced accumulation of receptors at developing neuromuscular synapses Using nucleaseprotection assays we have found that ARIA causes a 2 to 16fold increase in the level of mRNA encoding the alpha subunit of the receptor with little or no change in the levels of gamma and deltasubunit messengers ARIA also increases the amount of a putative nuclear precursor of alphasubunit mRNA consistent with an activation of gene transcription These results suggest that the concentration of alpha subunit may limit the rate of biosynthesis of the acetylcholine receptors in chicken myotubes They also indicate that neuronal factors can regulate the expression of receptor subunit genes in a selective manner Tetrodotoxin 8bromocAMP and forskolin also increase the amount of alphasubunit mRNA with little change in the amount of gamma and deltasubunit mRNAs Unlike ARIA however these agents have little effect on the concentration of the alphasubunit nuclear precursor
S580	The mAb R189 recognizes a crossreacting idiotope outside the Agcombining site of the syngeneic anti HLADQw3 mAb KS13 whereas the mAb R138 KO334 KO3256 and KO3335 recognize spatially close private idiotopes within the Agcombining site of mAb KS13 All the analyzed Id require the association of the H and L chain of mAb KS13 for their expression The mAb R138 and R189 were shown to markedly differ in their ability to modulate immune lysis of target cells mediated by mAb KS13 mAb R189 did not affect Cdependent lysis of cultured B lymphoid cells WALK mediated by mAb KS13 but enhanced celldependent mAb KS13mediated lysis mAb R138 inhibited both C and celldependent lysis mediated by mAb KS13 The effect was influenced by the incubation conditions mAb R138 completely inhibited lysis when it was preincubated with mAb KS13 before being added to target cells inhibited it partially when it was added simultaneously with mAb KS13 to target cells and did not affect it when added to target cells which had been preincubated with mAb KS13 Neither mAb R138 nor R189 in combination with mAb KS13 modulated T cell proliferation induced by allogeneic HLA mismatched lymphocytes The system we have described may represent a useful in vitro model to investigate the mechanisms by which antiidiotypic antibodies may influence the outcome of organs transplanted in recipients with a history of humoral presensitization to donors HLA Ag
S581	This is a retrospective review of 67 patients with soft tissue or visceral sarcomas treated during 19731982 There were 40 males and 27 females The mean age was 36 with a range of 1 to 77 years of age The most common histologic subtypes were rhabdomyosarcoma 19 malignant fibrohistiocytoma 13 fibrosarcoma leiomyosarcoma dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans 12 each and liposarcoma 10 Among the 42 soft tissue sarcomas 33 occurred in the trunk 35 and 21 in the lower and upper extremities and 10 in the head and neck region Among the 25 visceral sarcomas 16 were in the thorax 56 involved abdominal or retroperitoneal organs and 28 were in the head and neck region Overall 33 of the 54 patients with early sarcomas were treated by surgical resection alone while 21 others had postoperative adjuvant radiotherapy andor chemotherapy Factors influencing survival are presented and patterns of metastasis discussed Overall 45 of the patients showed metastatic disease either at diagnosis 15 or during the followup period 30 The lung was involved in twothirds of the cases and was the most common site of spread In patients with rhabdomyosarcoma and malignant fibrohistiocytoma regional lymph node metastasis was noted in 36 and 17 respectively
S582	The influence of age on the mortality rate of 268 patients with acute pancreatitis was studied The hospital mortality rate for patients aged below 50 years was 59 per cent The figure increased to 213 per cent in patients aged over 75 the high mortality was accounted for by a higher incidence of deaths related to concomitant medical or surgical diseases in the same hospital admission rather than to complications resulting directly from the pathological process of acute pancreatitis When only deaths due to complications of acute pancreatitis were analysed the mortality rate was not significantly different between the young and elderly groups Moreover the complication rate and the proportion of patients having severe disease judged by the number of prognostic signs were not higher in the elderly Thus acute pancreatitis was intrinsically not more serious were it not for the presence of concomitant diseases with advanced age
S583	Dengue hemorrhagic fever is characterized by a sudden onset of fever that lasts for 27 days and then subsides at which time hemorrhagic manifestations become evident Sometimes there is an associated form of hypovolemic shock known as dengue shock syndrome There are usually significant changes in the liver the reticuloendothelial system and the vascular system eg necrosis of liver cells and focal hemorrhage increase in turnover of lymphocytes and diapedesis of erythrocytes through vessel walls Because of the lack of pathologic findings in major organs and the rapid recovery without sequelae of survivors physiologic dysfunction is thought to be secondary to the action of biologic mediators that are capable of producing severe illness with minimal structural injury
S584	There is general acceptance of a causal connection between mitral valve prolapse and systemic embolic events The precise mechanism however remains controversial with current hypotheses favoring the embolization of thrombotic deposits from the abnormal mitral valve It might be surmised that echocardiography could easily document the presence of such thrombi but actually this has never been reported previously Described herein is a patient with a severe cerebrovascular accident in whom echocardiography clearly demonstrated a mass of high embolic potential attached directly to the prolapsing mitral valve leaflet
S585	Both maternal isoimmunization and maternal autoimmune disease are associated with fetal death For isoimmunization the immunologic nature of fetal death hydrops fetalis is beyond question but many of the details are poorly understood It would be extremely helpful to know what immunologic factors are responsible for the wide variation in the degree of fetal hemolysis This information would surely lead to improved management of isoimmunized pregnancies and create new and more successful therapies for fetuses at risk for hemolysis The immunology of autoimmuneassociated fetal death is for the most part an enigma For the fetal deaths associated with SLE and the antiphospholipid antibodies demise appears to be a consequence of uteroplacental vascular damage But the observable pathology is nonspecific and the evidence for a direct immunologic mechanism is sparse The similarity between the uteroplacental vascular lesions found with these autoimmune conditions and those seen in preeclampsia demands more intensive investigation For the fetal deaths caused by complete congenital heart block associated with maternal autoantibodies the evidence for a direct immunologic mechanism is now being established As with isoimmunization a more complete understanding of autoimmuneassociated fetal death will open new avenues of management and therapy
S586	Sera from patients with primary biliary cirrhosis contain autoantibodies that recognize mitochondrial proteins Five of the target autoantigens have now been identified as enzymes of three related multienzyme complexes the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex the branched chain alphaketoacid dehydrogenase complex and the alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex Each complex consists of component enzymes designated E1 E2 and E3 In this report we confirm that primary biliary cirrhosis sera react with dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase the E2 component of alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex Seventythree of 188 39 primary biliary cirrhosis sera reacted with alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexE2 when immunoblotted against purified alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex one of these sera also reacted with the E1 component In addition primary biliary cirrhosis sera possessing alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexE2 reactivity specifically inhibited enzyme function of alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex Enzyme activity was not affected by primary biliary cirrhosis sera that contained autoantibodies to pyruvate dehydrogenase complexE2 andor branched chain alphaketoacid dehydrogenase complexE2 which lacked alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexE2 reactivity Furthermore affinitypurified primary biliary cirrhosis sera against alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexE2 inhibited only alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex activity but did not alter enzyme activity of either pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or branched chain alphaketoacid dehydrogenase complex Finally alphaketoglutarate dehydrogenase complexE2 specific affinitypurified antisera did not react on immunoblot with any component enzymes of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex or branched chain alphaketoacid dehydrogenase complexABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS

S588	Lasers have been used in otolaryngologyhead and neck surgery since the early 1970s mainly for endoscopic applications In particular the author discusses the use of the NdYAG contact laser surgery The techniques and training required in the use of these newer laser applications including the flexible fiber system for use in the tracheobronchial tree are reviewed
S589	We examine the evolutionary dynamics of gametic and genotypic disequilibria between a cytoplasmic gene and a nuclear gene under two mating system models relevant to hybrid zones In the first model in which female mating preference is determined by an epistatic interaction between the two loci permanent nonzero cytonuclear disequilibria are possible for a variety of initial genotype frequencies particularly when rates of assortative mating for the two parental species are high In contrast when mating preference is effectively determined by interaction between a cytoplasmic gene and the multilocus nuclear genotypes characteristic of the parental species all cytonuclear disequilibria as well as frequencies of pure parentals rapidly decay to zero unless assortative mating is nearly perfect Results of the models are applied to the interpretation of observed cytonuclear associations in a hybrid population of Hyla tree frogs
S590	The alcoholic patient in an attempt to maintain an altered mental status may ingest ethanol substitutes containing methanol ethylene glycol or isopropanol The subsequent clinical presentation in the Emergency Department is highly variable and depends on the ethanol substitute ingested the time since ingestion and concomitant ethanol abuse This article describes the clinical features of intoxication by the ethanol substitutes Early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention may prevent irreversible sequelae The rationale for treatment interventions is discussed
S591	Heparin hydrogenated dextran sulfate 8000 Usherdex 8 and dextran sulfate 8000 were administered to rats and the total drug was separated and determined in endothelium and plasma A large amount of each drug was recovered from endothelium 24 and 6 minutes after intravenous injection This accounted for the drug missing from plasma The drugs in water were placed in the stomach by catheter All three drugs were recovered from the endothelium and identified unchanged by electrophoresis and specific staining The amounts that were recovered at 24 and 6 minutes were equivalent to most of the drug administered Thus heparin Usherdex 8 and dextran sulfate 8000 enter the body immediately on oral administration At longer time intervals after intravenous and oral administration much of each drug was not demonstrable in endothelium by the method used Some drug could be detected in endothelium after 4 hours After oral administration plasma levels of each drug were rarely more than 05 of the dose Formalinalcohol was applied to the jugular veins of anesthetized rats to produce a thrombus see Blake et al J Clin Path 19591211822 and the drugs were immediately introduced into the stomach Four hours later the injured veins were inspected for thrombi Incidence of thrombotic plug was 80 in rats that received saline solution 4 with Usherdex 8 0 with dextran sulfate 8000 and 0 with heparin Usherdex 8 dextran sulfate 8000 and heparin demonstrate low moderate and high in vitro anticoagulant activity respectivelyABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S592	We attempted to purify a digitalislike factor from human urine On the assumption that a natural ligand for the digitalis receptor should be searched for on the basis of the effects on intact cells we used an inhibitory effect on the binding of 3Houabain to human erythrocytes to determine digitalislike activity A highly polar 3Houabain displacing activity was obtained by a combination of chromatographic procedures including reversephase high performance liquid chromatography Urinederived 3Houabain displacing activity a competitive inhibitor of ouabain binding to human erythrocytes acted on human lymphocytes in a similar manner The doseresponse curve of this compound was parallel to that of ouabain Urinederived 3Houabain displacing activity significantly inhibited monensinstimulated increase in ouabainsensitive 86Rb uptake a parameter of NaKadenosine triphosphatase ATPase by 95 p less than 001 in cultured vascular smooth muscle cells A10 cells Furthermore this compound enhanced net 45Ca influx by 30 p less than 001 and reduced 45Ca efflux by 35 p less than 001 in A10 cells These results suggest that urinederived 3Houabain displacing activity may be a regulator of NaKATPase and a modulator of vascular tone
S593	The effect of 11 derivatives of 1deoxynojirimycin DNM on the replication of HIV1 was studied Compared with DNM seven of them showed remarkable inhibition of HIV1induced syncytium formation at significantly low concentrations which were not cytotoxic Two derivatives were found to markedly reduce the infectious virus yields from cell lines chronically infected with HIV Analysis of HIV1 envelope glycoproteins showed that the derivatives induced modification of the processing of not only gp120160 but also the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 The modification of the processing of the transmembrane glycoprotein gp41 might play an important role in the inhibition of virus replication at a step after the binding of gp120 to CD4 The enhanced antiHIV activity of DNM derivatives reported here could increase the possibility of nontoxic therapeutic intervention in HIV infections
S594	This study compares the findings of multidisciplinary evaluation to the twonight use of the SnapGauge band in 100 impotent men An organic etiology was diagnosed in 52 percent of those evaluated The SnapGauge band proved accurate as a screening device for organic disease If no elements were broken over the twonight period this finding correlated with multisystemic diagnosis of organic etiology in 86 percent of cases Among the 52 patients in whom an organic etiology was diagnosed 32 broke no elements for a 62 percent sensitivity When more than one element was broken the predictive value as to etiology of the erectile dysfunction diminished
S595	To aid in the identification of key residues responsible for the control of class II MHC betaalpha dimer assembly and expression a series of cotransfections of human plus mouse beta and alphagenes was performed The resulting expression data were correlated with the sequences of the relevant proteins to identify residues that played critical roles in these processes For the IEDR homologues good expression was seen for both E beta DR alpha and DR beta E alpha combinations involving several allelically variable betachains of each species These results are consistent with the sequence conservation seen for IE and DR gene products and indicate that the speciesspecific differences that do exist play little role in controlling dimer formation or transport For A beta chains a more complex picture was seen A beta d but not A beta k or A beta b was found to coexpress with human alphachains Not only did A beta d show expression with the homologous DQ alphachain but it also was expressed with DR alpha and DP alpha These data indicate that speciesspecific residues do not control dimer expression under these conditions and confirm that allelically polymorphic residues have a crucial role in this process Mapping studies using recombinant A beta genes established the importance of the residues in the aminoterminal half of the beta 1 domain in the differences observed among the A beta alleles Sequence comparison of DR beta DP beta DQ beta E beta and A beta chains in this region revealed a single residue position 12 conserved in most chains and differing in a nonconservative fashion between A beta d vs A beta b or k A beta d has the conserved lysine at this position whereas A beta b has methionine and A beta k has glutamine To test whether this residue actually was important physiologically a lysine codon was created in a recombinant A beta gene possessing the aminoterminal sequence of the kappa haplotype and the ability of this mutant chain to be expressed with various mouse A alphachains was examined This mutant chain was shown to gain the ability to be efficiently expressed with A alpha d without losing its ability to be expressed with A alpha k These data reemphasize the special role played by allelically polymorphic residues in Ia expression and identify one such polymorphic site as position 12ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS
S596	The authors have developed and tested a nutrient analysis program that will compute and present graphically summary statistics of population and population subgroup nutrient intakes The program analyzes for 44 nutrients from 5800 separate food items Capabilities of the program include storage of large numbers of diet records and evaluations of their nutrients calculation of nutrient means and standard deviations data sorting based on subject characteristics such as age sex and supplement use and generation of bar graphs and line plots for individual andor group data To test this computerized nutrient analysis program two sets of 3day diet records from 200 elderly individuals were analyzed The program was then used to generate means differences between means and distribution frequencies of designated nutrients for various population subgroups eg men greater than or equal to 65 years vs men greater than or equal to 80 years as well as comparisons with individual files eg Mr Smith vs all men greater than or equal to 65 years The statistical and graphics capabilities also function within the context of recipe analysis and menu planning which enhances the application of this program in institutional and community nutrition settings

S598	Acute abdominal pain continues to provide not only a large workload for the general surgeon but also many diagnostic and management problems Many different techniques have been introduced over the past two decades to help in the management of the acute abdomen and this review considers their relative claims to become incorporated into the process of clinical decisionmaking The evidence in support of formally structured patient interview pathways with or without computeraided diagnostic programs is now overwhelming and should become routine Both laparoscopy and peritoneal cytology have an important role to play in the management of patients in whom the decision to operate is in doubt and a combination of the two would be complementary Ultrasonography has become increasingly popular for investigating the acute abdomen and results from specialist centres are impressive However the problems of operator variation and the difficulties in providing a 24h service will probably prevent it from becoming a firstline investigation in most hospitals Although plain radiography has been available for many years its routine use in the management of the acute abdomen remains controversial Recent studies have confirmed that contrast radiography is an important adjunct to decisionmaking particularly in the management of large bowel obstruction and there is increasing evidence to support its use in suspected small bowel obstruction perforated peptic ulcer and acute diverticular disease
S599	To date analysis of the DNA content of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas has relied on the homogenation of the entire tissue specimen and subsequent staining and quantitation of the naked nuclei This methodology does not make allowance for the extremely variable nature of these tumors with respect to their cellular composition Further by destroying the cytoplasm and cell membranes this methodology makes it impossible to distinguish the DNA content of the tumor cells from that of the background stromal and inflammatory cells The authors present a methodology for the selective exclusion of inflammatory cell infiltrates from the DNA analysis of these tumors Using this technique it has been found that exclusion of the inflammatory cells allows the investigator to look more specifically at the malignant cell population This has been most helpful in those samples in which the tumor cells have been diploid or neardiploid With this technical refinement the relationship between DNA ploidy and clinical prognosis may be more accurately assessed

S601	Studies of marginal zinc deficiency in rhesus monkeys have demonstrated that plasma Zn levels are often a poor indication of Zn status To better assess the Zn status of these animals we examined their liver concentration of Zn as well as of other minerals metallothionein MT and superoxide dismutase SOD Liverwedge biopsies were obtained from adult rhesus monkeys fed for 15 mo either a control 100 micrograms Zng or a marginally Zn deficient diet 4 microgramsg ZD Liver Zn and MT concentrations were lower in ZD monkeys than in controls whereas iron concentration was higher in ZD monkeys than in controls Liver copper manganese and magnesium concentrations and activities of CuZnSOD and MnSOD were similar in the two groups Data from the groups were pooled for regression analysis Measurement of liver Zn and MT concentrations are useful in the assessment of the effects of longterm Zn deprivation in primates
S602	We have investigated the effect of joint tamponade and of traction in extension on the oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions in the femoral head of the immature goat using mass spectrometry Tamponade of 75 mmHg caused the oxygen tension in the femoral head to drop from 48  4 mmHg to 29  3 mmHg Traction in extension further decreased the oxygen tension Both these changes were highly significant The partial pressure of carbon dioxide increased but to a lesser extent and only effusion together with traction gave a statistically significant effect Our study showed that joint effusion can produce hypoxia in the bone as a result of impaired blood flow to the femoral head The application of traction increases this haemodynamic effect
S603	Induction of terminal differentiation of leukemic and preleukemic cells is a therapeutic approach to leukemia and preleukemia The 1 alpha 25dihydroxyvitamin D3 125OH2D3 the hormonally active form of vitamin D3 can induce differentiation and inhibit proliferation of leukemia cells but concentrations required to achieve these effects cause lifethreatening hypercalcemia Seven new analogs of 125OH2D3 were discovered to be either equivalent or more potent than 125OH2D3 as assessed by a inhibition of clonal proliferation of HL60 EM2 U937 and patients myeloid leukemic cells and b induction of differentiation of HL60 promyelocytes Furthermore these analogs stimulated clonal growth of normal human myeloid stem cells The most potent analog 125dihydroxy16ene23ynevitamin D3 was about fourfold more potent than 125OH2D3 This analog decreased clonal growth and expression of cmyc oncogene in HL60 cells by 50 within ten hours of exposure Effects on calcium metabolism of these novel analogs in vivo was assessed by intestinal calcium absorption ICA and bone calcium mobilization BCM Each of the analogs mediated markedly less 10 to 200fold ICA and BCM as compared with 125OH2D3 To gain insight into the possible mechanism of action of these new analogs receptor binding studies were done with 125OH216ene23yneD3 and showed that it competed only about 60 as effectively as 125OH2D3 for 125OH2D3 receptors present in HL60 cells and 98 as effective as 125OH2D3 for receptors present in chick intestinal cells In summary we have discovered seven novel vitamin D analogs that are more potent than the physiologic 125OH2D3 as measured by a variety of hematopoietic assays In contrast these compounds appear to have the potential to be markedly less toxic induction of hypercalcemia These novel vitamin D compounds may be superior to 125OH2D3 in a number of clinical situations including leukemiapreleukemia they will provide a tool to dissect the mechanism of action of vitamin D secosteroids in promoting cellular differentiation
S604	We assessed risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus HIV infection in 633 heterosexual intravenous drug users The HIV seroprevalence was 26 in blacks 10 in Hispanics and 6 in whites Intravenous cocaine use significantly increased the risk of HIV infection with a seroprevalence of 35 in daily cocaine users odds ratio 64 95 confidence interval 30 to 133 Black subjects were more likely to use cocaine regularly Drug use in shooting galleries and sharing of drug injection equipment were also associated with HIV infection and were more common in cocaine users By multivariate analysis black race daily cocaine injection by blacks and Hispanics all other cocaine injection heavy use prior to entry into methadone treatment by blacks and use of drugs in shooting galleries were independent predictors of HIV infection Methadone therapy was associated with substantial reductions in heroin use and some reduction in cocaine use but 24 of cocaine users receiving methadone began or increased cocaine injection after entry into treatment

S607	Expansion of resident training in ambulatory medicine has created new challenges for faculty preceptors Outpatient teaching is hampered by inadequate time and a reliance on methods of instruction that are more useful for the inpatient setting Effective outpatient teaching requires an understanding of the objectives of ambulatory medical training and improved facility with teaching methods that accommodate the brief impromptu nature of ambulatory teaching In a hypothetical outpatient teaching encounter the interactions between the patient resident and attending physician are dissected to reveal missed opportunities to teach and to explore alternative approaches to the educational process These approaches include promoting the residents role as the primary provider developing a limited teaching agenda for each teaching encounter focusing on the learner rather than on the diagnostic dilemma posed by the patient and using questions role modeling and observation with feedback to promote learning
S608	Physical therapists frequently evaluate the lower extremity and this evaluation often includes measuring the subtalar joint neutral STJN position and subtalar joint STJ passive range of motion PROM This report critically reviews methods used to measure STJN position and STJ PROM Standardized methods for taking these measurements which have been clinically tested and appear to be theoretically sound are presented Although these methods are based on anatomical considerations their reliability is less than optimal However these are the only methods of measuring STJN position and STJ PROM that have been tested adequately for reliability
S609	Intestinal permeability in controls and in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis was assessed by measuring the radioactivity in 24h urine collections after oral administration of 51CrEDTA Intestinal permeability in the patients was found to be significantly increased in comparison to controls Of the patients 67 86 not taking any prescribed nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug NSAID at the time of study had normal results whereas 2329 patients 79 taking prescribed NSAIDs displayed increased intestinal permeability It has not been determined beyond doubt whether this finding is due to disease process or therapy with oral NSAIDs
S610	The immunogenicity and antigenicity of synthetic peptides SP derived from the sequences of a cell surface Ag of Streptococcus mutans were investigated in macaque monkeys Immunization with the free peptides of 11 17 and 21 residues failed to elicit serum antibodies or T cell responses However immunization with the SP17 and SP21 linked to tetanus toxoid TT as a carrier elicited serum antibodies and proliferative responses of lymphocytes not only to the SP but also to the native streptococcal Ag In vivo recall of SPTT immunized monkeys with suboptimal doses of the native streptococcal Ag resulted in a significant increase in antibodies both to the SP and the streptococcal Ag confirming that the SP shares antigenic epitopes with the native Ag B and T cell epitopes were then determined and a B cell epitope was found in residues 813 whereas an overlapping T cell epitope was located in residues 715 The T cell epitope has an aminoterminal leucine and carboxyterminal glycine and alanine added to residues 813 of the B cell epitope In spite of the B and T cell epitopes being expressed in SP17 residues 115 the monomer failed to induce serum antibodies without a carrier However immunization with a dimer of SP17 elicited both serum antibodies and proliferative responses of lymphocytes without a carrier The results suggest that the monomeric SP17 is not immunogenic and needs to be dimerised in order to elicit antibodies and T cell responses both to the SP and to the streptococcal Ag
S611	The survival benefit of combination chemotherapy to patients with advanced nonsmallcell carcinoma of the lung NSCLC is controversial To study this question the National Cancer Institute of Canada NCIC Clinical Trials Group conducted a prospective randomized trial comparing best supportive care BSC to two chemotherapy regimens vindesine and cisplatin VP and cyclophosphamide doxorubicin and cisplatin CAP Between February 1983 and January 1986 23 centers across Canada entered 251 patients on study Eighteen centers participated in the threearm schema 150 patients centers choosing not to participate in a study with a nochemotherapy arm followed a twoarm schema comparing VP with CAP 101 additional patients Altogether 233 patients were eligible Patients had measurable or evaluable disease with either distant metastases 825 or bulky limited disease considered inoperable or unsuitable for radical radiotherapy The treatment groups were comparable in terms of age sex performance status histology disease extent and weight loss The overall response rates complete response CR plus partial response PR on the chemotherapy arms were CAP 153 and VP 253 P  06 Patients on the threearm portion of the trial had a median survival of 326 weeks when treated with VP 247 weeks with CAP and 17 weeks with BSC The significance of the differences in survival adjusted for prognostic factors is as follows chemotherapy v BSC P  02 VP v BSC P  01 and CAP v BSC P  05 Toxicity on the chemotherapy arms was significant with leukopenia of severe or greater degree occurring in 378 CAP and 400 VP severe vomiting in 122 CAP and 233 VP and severe neurotoxicity in 156 VP
S612	Aland Island eye disease AIED is an Xchromosomal disorder characterized by reduced visual acuity progressive axial myopia regular astigmatism latent nystagmus foveal hypoplasia defective dark adaptation and fundus hypopigmentation The syndrome was originally reported in 1964 in a family on the Aland Islands To determine the localization of the AIED gene linkage studies were performed in this family total of 37 polymorphisms covering loci on the entire X chromosome were used By twopoint analysis the strongest evidence for linkage was obtained between AIED and DXS255 maximum lod score Zmax 492 at maximum recombination fraction theta max 00 Marker loci DXS106 DXS159 and DXS1 also showed no recombination with AIED Other positive lod scores at theta max 00 were obtained with markers localized in the XY homologous region in Xq13q21 but the numbers of informative meioses were small Multilocus linkage analysis indicated that the most probable location of AIED is in the pericentromeric region between DXS7 and DXS72 These results rule out localizations of AIED more distal on Xp that have been proposed by others Our data do not exclude the possibility that AIED and incomplete congenital stationary night blindness are caused by mutations in the same gene This question should be resolved by careful clinical comparison of the disorders and ultimately by the molecular dissection of the genes themselves
S613	Patients with a spontaneous pneumothorax frequently present for care in the emergency department The occurrence of spontaneous pneumothorax during parturition occurs rarely We describe a case of spontaneous pneumothorax during the first trimester of pregnancy which resolved with tube thoracostomy The patient delivered vaginally a healthy 43 kg male at term under epidural anesthesia We discuss spontaneous pneumothorax and review reported cases during pregnancy
S614	PTA is an established method of revascularization in a variety of medical conditions It is performed for specific morphologic and clinical indications PTA is the procedure of choice in Fontaine stage IIB through IV lower extremity ischemia due to iliac andor femoropopliteal stenosis or short occlusion Its role is less certain in infrapopliteal disease although current studies have begun to establish longterm effectiveness PTA is the procedure of choice for renal revascularization in renovascular hypertension due to fibromuscular disease or nonostial atherosclerosis selected cases of renal artery stenosis associated with renal insufficiency and transplant renal artery stenosis It is also useful in treating the renovascular component of complex hypertension and may be indicated in severe renal artery stenosis 7599 even in the absence of clinically demonstrable RVHTN PTA has limited applications in the venous system and only shortterm success in the treatment of stenoses in dialysis access fistulas PTA often serves as an important adjunct to surgical revascularization by providing improved inflow or outflow PTA is the procedure of choice when anatomically feasible in subclavian steal syndrome The role of PTA in carotid artery disease particularly atheromatous disease of the internal carotid artery is uncertain The same may be said of PTA for vertebral artery stenosis although the overwhelming majority of vertebral artery stenoses are morphologically suitable for PTA PTA and surgery are both effective in the treatment of abdominal angina There are more data available to verify the longterm patency of thromboendarterectomy and bypass grafts than PTA for mesenteric ischemia However since the technical success for PTA is high and since coronary comorbidity is the most common cause of perioperative mortality in surgical series PTA should be seriously considered as the procedure of first choice Serious complications of PTA occur in approximately 5 of cases Two to three percent of PTA patients have complications requiring surgery or causing a prolongation or alteration of hospital course The morbidity mortality and cost associated with PTA are low The discomfort is minor and postprocedural recovery rapid The major limitations of PTA include its unsuitability for some lesions longsegment occlusions and stenoses orifice lesions eccentric lesions and postangioplasty restenosis These problems are being addressed by ongoing laboratory and clinical research In the near future it is likely that endoluminal transmural sonography of the vessel wall will help guide our interventions
S615	Prosolin is a major cytosolic protein Mr 18400 isoelectric point 59 first reported in HL60 promyelocytic leukemia cells It is rapidly phosphorylated 15 to 30 min in response to TPA treatment as an early event in a sequence that leads to cessation of cell proliferation and to differentiation of promyelocytes into monocytes In our study we examined the expression of prosolin in human peripheral lymphocytes and investigated the effects of TPA treatment on prosolin phosphorylation and on lymphocyte proliferation Prosolin was not expressed in resting PBL but was induced after 24 to 36 h of PHA stimulation simultaneously with induction of DNA synthesis In rapidly proliferating IL2 dependent PBL prosolin was a major cytosolic component comprising 05 of total cytosolic protein of which approximately 28 was phosphorylated Expression of prosolin decreased again when either mitogeninduced or IL2dependent proliferation diminished during extended periods in culture Thus expression of prosolin is correlated with periods when PBL are cycling through Sphase TPA treatment of IL2dependent PBL at the peak of their growth caused phosphorylation of about twothirds of preexisting unphosphorylated prosolin within 1 h This was accompanied by cessation of cell proliferation as indicated by measurements of TdR incorporation Although TPA has well known mitogenic effects in lymphocytes during initial activation this result shows that it exerts an antiproliferative effect in rapidly dividing PBL It is suggested that increased phosphorylation of prosolin may be an initiating event in the antiproliferative response to TPA which would occur only in proliferating lymphocytes expressing prosolin
S616	Twentyone patients were enrolled in a randomized doubleblind study that examined the effects of topical 005 tretinoin alltransretinoic acid vitamin A acid RetinA solution on dysplastic nevi Following histologic confirmation of the diagnosis of dysplastic nevus in three representative lesions patients applied either tretinoin or a placebo containing 50 alcohol to selected dysplastic nevi once a day under tape occlusion or twice a day unoccluded for 4 months Immediate posttreatment comparative photographs showed marked fading or elimination of some dysplastic nevi clinically and histologic examination of excisional biopsy specimens showed disappearance or reversion to benign nevi in many of the treated lesions There were no clinical or histologic changes in those dysplastic nevi treated with placebo This study shows a definite biological effect of topical tretinoin on some dysplastic nevi
S617	Bromfenac 2amino34bromobenzoylbenzenacetic acid sodium salt sesquihydrate exhibited potent analgesic and antiinflammatory activity in mice and rats In a mouse model of pain acetylcholine abdominal constriction bromfenac showed a rapid onset of activity 20 min that persisted for at least 4 hr In a rat model of inflammation carrageenan foot edema a single oral dose of bromfenac 0316 mgkg produced significant antiinflammatory activity up to 24 hr after dosing Bromfenac was readily absorbed after oral administration peak plasma levels being achieved at the earliest time tested 20 min in the mouse and 30 min in the rat The plasma halflife of bromfenac in rats is less than 4 hr Since the antiinflammatory activity persisted for 20 to 24 hr in spite of its short plasma halflife it appears that there is no direct correlation between duration of activity and plasma drug level
S618	The effect of alveolar oxygen tension on lung lipid peroxidation during lung ischemia was evaluated by using isolated rat lungs perfused with synthetic medium After a 5min equilibration period global ischemia was produced by discontinuing perfusion while ventilation continued with gas mixtures containing 5 CO2 and a fixed oxygen concentration between 0 and 95 Lipid peroxidation was assessed by measurement of tissue thiobarbituric acidreactive products and conjugated dienes Control studies no ischemia showed no change in parameters of lipid peroxidation during 1 h of perfusion and ventilation with 20 or 95 O2 With 60 min of ischemia there was increased lipid peroxidation which varied with oxygen content of the ventilating gas and was markedly inhibited by ventilation with N2 Perfusion with 5 8 11 14eicosatetraynoic acid indicated that generation of eicosanoids during ischemia accounted for approximately 4050 of lung lipid peroxide production Changes of CO2 content of the ventilating gas to alter tissue pH or of perfusate glucose concentration had no effect on lipid peroxidation during ischemia but perfusion at 8 of the normal flow rate prevented lipid peroxidation Lung drywet weight measured after 3 min of reperfusion showed good correlation between lung fluid accumulation and lipid peroxidation These results indicate that reperfusion is not necessary for lipid peroxidation with ischemic insult of the lung and provide evidence that elevated PO2 during ischemia accelerates the rate of tissue injury
S619	We identified a patient CAG with scleroderma whose serum contained a high titer of IgG class antibodies that stained nucleoli in a pattern of independent tiny spots When tested on isolated chromosomes these antibodies selectively stained the nucleolusorganizing regions NOR of chromosomes 13 14 15 21 and 22 These staining patterns were not altered when substrate cells and chromosomes were treated with RNase 01 M HC1 or 4 M urea but they were abolished by treatment with DNase and trypsin Immunoblots performed with serum CAG on isolated nucleolar substrates identified a protein antigen of approximately 90 kDa Antibodies affinitypurified from this protein selectively stained nucleoli and NOR chromosomal regions Therefore this protein is the antigen that accounts for the ability of serum CAG to recognize the NOR In a search for the NOR 90kDa specificity among 254 patients with various rheumatic diseases we found nine additional patients whose sera stained metaphase chromosomes selectively at the NOR Sera from five of them three with scleroderma two of unknown diagnosis recognized a protein that electrophoretically comigrated with the CAG antigen Thus scleroderma is present in at least four of six who appear to have this specificity We conclude that autoantibodies to the NOR 90kDa antigen have an association with scleroderma and may be useful diagnostically and as a probe for further studies of the biology of the cell nucleolus
S620	Opportunistic infections ultimately occur in most patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus HIV and are responsible for 90 of deaths Over the decade since the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS was first recognized important advances have been made in reducing the morbidity and mortality of opportunistic infections in patients infected with HIV These include an improved understanding of the relationship between immunologic parameters and infection allowing the occurrence of infectious complications to be more predictable development of prophylactic regimens and chronic suppressive regimens that are effective well tolerated and convenient and emphasis on earlier diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of those infectious processes that are not prevented These advances have allowed the quality and duration of patient survival to improve during this decade but they can also be anticipated to alter the spectrum of clinical manifestations that health care providers are going to see during this epidemics second decade
S621	Highfrequency jet ventilation HFJV is FDAapproved for ventilating patients with bronchopleural fistulae BPF yet little is known about its effect on the fistula airleak We quantitated a patients BPF airleak during both conventional volumecycled ventilation and HFJV The effect of chesttube suction CTS on BPF flow was also studied Despite a significant reduction in peak airway pressure the HFJV resulted in a 5070 percent increase in BPF flow CTS also significantly increased the airleak HFJV may not always be the preferential method for ventilating patients with BPF and we recommend measuring the fistula airleak when attempting to optimize a patients ventilatory parameters
S622	To help elucidate the general rules of equilibrium globular protein folding dynamic Monte Carlo simulations of a model betabarrel globular protein having the sixstranded Greek key motif characteristic of real globular proteins were undertaken The model protein possesses a typical betabarrel amino acid sequence however all residues of a given type eg hydrophobic residues are identical Even in the absence of sitespecific interactions starting from a hightemperature denatured state these models undergo an allornone transition to a structurally unique sixstranded betabarrel These simulations suggest that the general rules of globular protein folding are rather robust in that the overall tertiary structure is determined by the general pattern of hydrophobic hydrophilic and turntype residues with sitespecific interactions mainly involved in structural fine tuning of a given topology Finally these studies suggest that loops may play an important role in producing a unique native state Depending on the stability of the native conformation of the long loop in the Greek key the conformational transition can be described by a twostate threestate or even larger number of multiple equilibrium states model
S623	We treated 14 patients by transplantation of marrow from unrelated volunteer donors Eight patients had severe aplastic anemia 3 had chronic granulocytic leukemia and 3 had Fanconis anemia The results are compared with those of a group of 14 similar patients transplanted concurrently from human leukocyte antigen HLAmismatched family members Sustained engraftment was achieved in 8 of 14 patients in both groups one additional patient survived with autologous marrow reconstitution following an unrelated donor transplant In the unrelated donor group 6 of 9 evaluable patients developed grade III through IV acute graftvhost disease as compared with 4 of 9 patients after familymismatched transplants Overall survival was similar in the two groups In the unrelated donor group 4 of 14 29 patients survived median survival 1299 days as compared with 5 of 14 36 in the mismatchedfamily donor group median survival 808 days In both groups patients with HLA phenotypically matched donors fared better than those with donors who were mismatched for one or more HLA antigen Of the patients transplanted from HLA phenotypically matched donors 6 of 12 patients 50 survived as compared with 3 of 16 patients 19 transplanted from HLAmismatched donors We conclude that unrelated donor bone marrow transplantation BMT should be considered in those cases of leukemia or bone marrow failure in which the chance of cure using conventional therapy is remote and a HLA genotypically or phenotypically matched family donor is not available
S624	Monoclonal antibodies were produced by immunization of the human glioma cell line SKMG4 One of the antibodies designated G22 reacted with 18 of 20 glioma cell lines two melanoma cell lines and three lung cancer cell lines but not with 39 cell lines derived from sarcoma carcinoma or hematopoietic tumors The antigen was expressed in the brain of human fetuses in early gestation 9 weeks but not in late gestation 8 months or in normal adult brain suggesting that the antibody recognizes neural differentiation antigens expressed by neuroectodermal origin A high incidence of positive antigens has been observed in gliomas but not in the other neural tumors such as ependymomas meningiomas and neuroblastomas Thus the antigen defined by the G22 monoclonal antibody could be defined as gliomaassociated antigen Pulselabeling with tritiated leucine and subsequent immunoprecipitation of the solubilized cell membrane revealed that the antigen recognized by this antibody had a molecular weight of 67 kD on sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis SDSPAGE It was shown by dotblot enzymelinked immunospecific assay ELISA that the antigen could be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF from patients with gliomas From analysis of affinity chromatography and SDSPAGE the antigen present in the CSF had a molecular weight similar to that of a 1 Nonidet P40 NP40 extract from a glioma cell line When the antigen in CSF was quantitatively assayed by ELISA the mean antigen level expressed as optical density at 450 nm in the CSF of seven patients was 08  028 mean  standard deviation which was significantly higher than the 038  014 level observed in the CSF of 15 patients with nonglioma brain tumors and the 023  009 level in the CSF of four patients without brain tumors These results indicate that the monoclonal antibody G22 is useful for the diagnosis of glioma
S625	The authors describe the case of a young man who presented with a central scotoma in one eye and a temporal hemianopsia in the other Magnetic resonance imaging showed distinctive bilobed thickening of the chiasm and a potbelly expansion of the contiguous optic nerves The distal portions of the intracranial optic nerves appeared normal At craniotomy incision of the lamina terminalis exposed intraventricular craniopharyngioma with anterior extension into the chiasm and proximal optic nerves Partial resection of the tumor restored normal vision
S626	Attitudes toward alcoholism among a representative sample of 524 adults in Georgia indicate acceptance of the disease concept remains incomplete Despite expected regional differences results from bivariate analyses are consistent with previous research conducted in other areas of the US The Georgia data indicate similar levels of acceptance of the disease concept of alcoholism similar demographic correlates with that acceptance and similar treatment recommendations for alcoholism Attitudes toward alcoholism are found to be significantly correlated with views concerning cocaine dependence but the acceptance of the disease concept of alcoholism is significantly greater The multivariate discriminant analysis reveals that education and income are the most significant discriminators between the medical and moralmedical images of alcoholism followed by religion age and race
S627	We examined the effects of ischemia with and without reperfusion on endotheliumdependent and independent vascular relaxation in both conduit and resistance coronary arteries Studies were performed on dogs under control conditions n  13 or after 1 hour of circumflex coronary artery occlusion with n  10 or without n  8 1 hour of reperfusion Rings of obtuse marginal branches of the left circumflex coronary artery conduit arteries were studied in organ chambers Coronary microvessels 110220microns diameter were studied in a pressurized state with an in vitro microvessel imaging apparatus Relaxation was evaluated after preconstriction with prostaglandin F2 alpha and U46619 a thromboxane A2 analogue in conduit and resistance vessels respectively Conduit vessel function was not altered by ischemia with or without reperfusion Endotheliumdependent microvascular relaxation was depressed in response to acetylcholine ADP and calcium ionophore A23187 after ischemia with reperfusion compared with control relaxation ED50 as logM 60  02 p less than 005 51  04 p less than 005 and 58  01 versus 68  02 68  02 and 66  02 respectively Ischemia without reperfusion modestly altered microvascular endotheliumdependent relaxation Microvascular relaxation to nitroglycerin was not altered by ischemia with reperfusion We conclude that 1 endotheliumdependent relaxation in large epicardial coronary arteries is relatively refractory to ischemia with or without reperfusion 2 ischemia alone produces mild alterations of coronary microvascular reactivity 3 ischemia followed by reperfusion produces a marked and selective impairment of endotheliumdependent responses in the coronary microcirculation
S628	This study was undertaken to determine whether the expression of ras oncogene product p21 can be used as a tumor cell marker of gastric and colonic carcinoma in brush smears To detect p21 an immunocytochemical assay with RAP5 monoclonal antibody was used Benign epithelial gastric cells obtained from normal gastric mucosa or benign gastric lesions reacted negatively in 12 out of 13 cases Similarly benign epithelial colonic cells from normal colon or benign colonic lesions were negative for p21 in nine out of ten cases Weakly positive reaction confined to a few cell clusters only was observed in one smear of a benign gastric ulcer and one smear of chronic ulcerative colitis All 20 smears from colonic carcinoma and all 20 smears of gastric carcinoma contained cells that stained positively for p21 and the degree of tumor differentiation had no impact on the staining pattern The results recorded in this study show that the immunocytochemical assay for the ras oncogene product may prove to represent a new tool for the cytodiagnosis of gastric and colonic carcinomas
S629	Four options are currently available to surgeons for the management of ulcerative colitis the brooke ileostomy ileorectostomy Kock pouch and ileal pouchanal anastomosis The latter comes closest to the ideal operation as it is curative and physiological and restorative of quality of life It is the authors preferred alternative in most patients Obstructive Crohns disease of the small intestine can be ameliorated without loss of bowel by stricture plasty
S630	The role of brain and circulating catecholamines as mediators of burninduced hypermetabolism was investigated in two experiments Following a 30 body surface area fullthickness openflame burn rats exhibited a short period 3 to 4 days of anorexia followed by a more prolonged several weeks hyperphagichypermetabolic response During this hypermetabolic period norepinephrine concentrations were increased in the brain and circulating epinephrine levels were elevated Depletion of brain norepinephrine using 6hydroxydopamine led to increased body weight gain but did not increase resting energy expenditure in burned rats Similarly the reduction of circulating catecholamines through removal of the adrenal medulla resulted in a decreased loss of body weight and only slight reductions in resting energy expenditure Therefore these results suggest that although brain norepinephrine and circulating epinephrine have a role in the full expression of hypermetabolism these compounds do not appear to be major mediators of this response to burn trauma
S631	Human squamous epithelial cells maintained in growth factordeficient medium were examined for sensitivity to alltrans retinoic acid retinoic acid Under conditions of low external Ca2 015 mmoll millimolar or high external Ca2 14 mmoll retinoic acid stimulated proliferation Concomitantly cellsubstrate adhesion was decreased Enzymelinked immunosorbent assays were used to assess production of two extracellular matrix components ie fibronectin and thrombospondin In the presence of retinoic acid production of both was decreased Because both fibronectin and thrombospondin serve as epithelial cell adhesion factors the decreased production of these moieties could contribute to reduced adhesion Using 45Ca2 to measure total cellassociated Ca2 and the Ca2sensitive dye Indo1 to measure intracellular free Ca2 it was found that concentrations of retinoic acid that altered cellsubstrate adhesion in the squamous epithelial cells had no effect on total cellassociated Ca2 but reduced intracellular free Ca2 by 50 to 60 Because Ca2 is a regulator of adhesion the ability of retinoic acid to modulate Ca2 levels in the squamous epithelial cells may explain in part how retinoic acid influences their adhesiveness
S632	Overlapping cDNAs derived from the chicken alphafibrinogen mRNA have been sequenced beginning from within the coding region for the signal peptide of this subunit and terminating within the polyA extension The predicted size of chicken alphafibrinogen is 54187 daltons which is the smallest of any alpha chain reported the oligopeptide repeats that characterize the central regions of the other alpha subunits were conspicuously absent A further unexpected finding was the presence on the mRNA of a separate long open reading frame 752 nucleotides beginning 312 nucleotides downstream from the alphafibrinogen coding sequence and containing intronlike features near its 5 end The protein sequence predicted from this second open reading frame lacks an initiating methionine but is homologous to the Cterminal regions of all known beta and gammafibrinogens as well as the C termini of two nonfibrinogen proteins cytotactin tenascin an extracellular matrix protein and pT49 a putative protein specific to cytotoxic T cells The intronlike features of the second open reading frame immediately precede the region of common homology and the beginnings of the corresponding homologous segments in the beta and gammafibrinogen sequences are marked by aligned intron positions Based on these findings it is proposed that fibrinogen gene evolution included a fusion of two distinct ancestral genes
S633	We prospectively studied the shortterm and longterm efficacy and safety of endoscopic laser treatment in 25 patients with dysphagia from advanced esophageal cancer Malignant stenoses were recanalized in all patients and the ability to swallow was improved in about 80 Results were best in patients with adenocarcinomas and in those who reported a good appetite A single laser treatment provided adequate palliation in more than half the patients until the time of death In those patients in whom stenosis recurred retreatment was necessary a median of 32 months after the initial laser treatment No laserrelated mortality or major morbidity occurred We conclude that endoscopic laser therapy seems to be a feasible method of palliating malignant dysphagia
S634	Family practice as a specialty now just over 20 years of age arose in response to increasing public pressure and societal needs not primarily from a breakthrough in new clinical knowledge or technology advances Its academic discipline of family medicine is necessarily derived more from its clinical principles and functions in practice than from a unique body of knowledge and skills Nevertheless the mixture of knowledge skills and attitudes are collectively unique as applied by the family physician and are teachable learnable and subject to critical inquiry and research This paper presents an overview of the progress present challenges and future opportunities of family medicine as an academic discipline A comparative analysis of the literature in the three primary care specialties reveals more commonalities than differences Family practice has much to contribute to needed reforms in medical education and the health care system The field is ideally positioned to be an active part of future resolutions to todays problems in both arenas
S635	We retrospectively studied the arteriograms of 135 men admitted for evaluation of lower extremity ischemia to examine whether race influences the severity of infragenicular occlusive disease The scoring system prepared by the Ad Hoc Committee on Reporting Standards for the Society for Vascular Surgery and the International Society for Cardiovascular Surgery was used to grade the severity of stenosis in each of the upper middle and lower thirds of the anterior and posterior tibial and peroneal arteries collectively called infragenicular arteries The patients were divided into two groups 83 blacks 140 arteriogram limbs and 52 whites 87 arteriogram limbs Disease severity scores between the groups were compared and the existence of five known risk factors for atherosclerosis were considered for poststratification adjustment Results showed that higher disease scores indicating more severe disease were found in the black population in every segment of the infragenicular arteries The mean  SE score for all the infragenicular segments in blacks was significantly higher than that in the whites 208  005 vs 157  006 p less than 0001 The black and white groups were comparable in terms of age 652 vs 646 years prevalence of diabetes 20 vs 25 smoking history 93 vs 90 and hypercholesterolemia 51 vs 63 Hypertension was more prevalent among the black patients 51 vs 27 p less than 0001 When only the nonhypertensive patients in both groups were considered however the mean severity score was still significantly higher in blacks 210  006 vs 142  006 p less than 0001ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S636	The aim of this study was to compare both subjectively and objectively four modern rateresponsive pacing modes in a doubleblind crossover design Twentytwo patients aged 18 to 81 years had an activitysensing dual chamber universal rateresponsive DDDR pacemaker implanted for treatment of high grade atrioventricular block and chronotropic incompetence They were randomly programmed to VVIR ventricular demand rateresponsive DDIR dual chamber demand rateresponsive DDD dual chamber universal or DDDR dual chamber universal rateresponsive mode and assessed after 4 weeks of outofhospital activity Five patients all with VVIR pacing requested early reprogramming The DDDR mode was preferred by 59 of patients the VVIR mode was the least acceptable mode in 73 Perceived general wellbeing exercise capacity functional status and symptoms were significantly worse in the VVIR than in dual rateresponsive modes Exercise treadmill time was longer in DDDR mode p less than 001 but similar in all other modes During standardized daily activities heart rate in VVIR and DDIR modes underresponded to mental stress All rateaugmented modes overresponded to staircase descent whereas the DDD mode significantly underresponded to staircase ascent Echocardiography revealed no difference in chamber dimensions left ventricular fractional shortening or pulmonary artery pressure in any mode Cardiac output was greater at rest in the dual modes than in the VVIR mode p  0006 but was similar at 120 beatsmin Beat to beat variability of cardiac output was greatest in VVIR mode p less than 00001 with DDIR showing greater variability than DDD or DDDR modes p less than 005 Mitral regurgitation estimated by Doppler color flow imaging was similar in all modes but tricuspid regurgitation was significantly greater in VVIR than in dual modes p less than 003 Subjects who preferred the DDDR mode and those who found the VVIR mode least acceptable had significantly greater increases in stroke volume when paced in the DDD mode than in the ventricularinhibited VVI mode at rest 22 when compared with subjects who preferred other modes 2 p  003 No other objective variable was predictive of subjective benefit from any rateresponsive pacing mode Thus dual sensor rateresponsive pacing DDDR is superior objectively and subjectively to single sensor VVIR DDIR and DDD pacing and subjective benefit from dual chamber rateaugmented pacing is predictable echocardiographically
S637	The prostate glands of 84 men undergoing cystoprostatectomy for bladder cancer were examined by wholemount sections at 4mm to 5mm intervals to identify unsuspected prostate adenocarcinoma PCa Of 72 white patients with entirely normal digital rectal examinations DRE 33 46 were found to have PCa including 12 17 who had a Gleason score of 6 or greater and seven 10 who had penetration through the prostatic capsule These observations are consistent with previous studies in autopsy populations but allow a more appropriate comparison with morphologic data generated from radical prostatectomy specimens If these data can be extended to the agematched general population treatment at a 1 mortality rate for all white men 60 to 74 years of age with a PCa with a Gleason score of 6 or greater could cause between 6190 and 30951 deaths in contrast to 7335 deaths expected from the cancer These data stress the need for a control group in a study designed to evaluate the benefit of early diagnosis and treatment of PCa
S638	Between 1976 and 1988 50 primary total knee arthroplasties were performed on 34 patients with psoriasis vulgaris The skin lesions were graded for severity in all patients and the extent of affected body surface was mapped All patients received perioperative antibiotics Only one deep infection with Staphylococcus aureus occurred 25 months after operation The average length of followup was nearly four and a half years being to a minimum of two years or until failure of the arthroplasty There appears to be no increased risk of deep infection in patient with psoriasis vulgaris undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty
S639	Mutant frequencies were measured in Tlymphocytes of patients undergoing radionuclide angiography with erythrocytes labeled in vivo with technetium99m Blood from 13 patients was sampled before and after 8120 days an injection with 750 MBq technetium99m Frequencies of HPRT mutants were measured with the Tcell cloning method Results indicated that the mean frequency of mutants after treatment was significantly below that measured before exposure Thus in contrast to published data our results do not support the conclusion that radionuclide angiography with technetium99m induces HPRT mutations Further analysis of our data indicated that the decrease in mutant frequency after exposure can be accounted for by an effect of cloning efficiency
S640	A prospective blind randomised trial was undertaken to determine if the incidence of postlumbar puncture headache is significantly altered by 24 hours recumbency One hundred and two patients were allocated randomly to rest supine in bed for either 4 or 24 hours after spinal anaesthesia for urological or gynaecological surgery A standardised spinal anaesthetic technique was applied that incorporated the use of a 22gauge needle All patients were followedup prospectively to determine if there was a difference in the incidence of postlumbar puncture headache between the two groups Five patients 116 who were recumbent for 4 hours developed postlumbar puncture headache a result which was not statistically significantly different from the seven patients 119 in the other group who complained of postlumbar puncture headache
S641	Hepatocellularcarcinoma HCC that occur in woodchucks chronically infected with woodchuck hepatitis virus WHV were screened for activation of cellular oncogenes Enhanced expression and allelic alterations of the cmyc oncogene were found in three HCC out of nine Variations in the size of the cmyc transcripts ranging from 20 kilobases kb to 56 kb as well as in the level of cmyc gene expression 550fold higher than in adjacent liver tissues were observed among the three HCC Rearrangements of the cmyc locus were either upstream of the gene or within the first intron Cloning and sequencing of the breakpoint region from one of the three tumours showed that the cmyc gene was truncated and joined to a unique cellular sequence of unknown function WHV DNA was not integrated near the cmyc coding exons excluding a direct role of the virus in cmyc activation The novel type of rearrangement and activation of the cmyc gene reported here in liver tumours of hepatitis virus infected animals appears strikingly similar to those resulting from chromosomal translocations in human Burkitts lymphomas acute B and Tcell leukaemias and mouse plasmacytomas
S642	We conducted basic studies to evaluate the effectiveness of our insulated needles using raw egg white and fish meat as test material The basic studies we carried out confirmed that the needles insulation would withstand the high frequency electric current passed through them This research served as the foundation for our clinical applications
S643	Fluid collections following renal transplantation are not rare and may be associated with serious complications We studied the incidence clinical features pathology and treatment outcome of perirenal fluid collections after kidney transplantation Between January 1977 and June 1985 386 consecutive renal transplants were performed at our university All allografts were studied with Bmode ultrasonography together with a renal scan in the immediate posttransplant period at 6month intervals or when clinically indicated Symptomatic fluid collections those associated with rejection episodes and those containing more than 50 to 100 ml fluid were aspirated under sonographic control via aseptic techniques There were 190 fluid collections 49 per cent observed during followup 2 to 11 years Of these collections 98 51 per cent were estimated to be less than 50 ml in volume were clinically insignificant and resulted in no morbidity A total of 92 collections was aspirated with 1 aspiration being diagnostic and therapeutic in 57 instances serous or serosanguinous fluid The 35 collections remaining were revealed to be lymphoceles on biochemical grounds Of 13 lymphoceles associated with rejection episodes 8 resolved on initial aspiration Of the recurrent lymph collections 27 were treated with repeated aspiration tetracycline sclerotherapy or an operation 10 were treated with marsupialization into the peritoneal cavity No large collections of urine or blood were detected and 1 infected lymphocele required external drainage No renal allograft was lost as a result of a fluid collection and overall graft survival was not affected by the development of perirenal fluid collections We conclude that perirenal fluid collections are detected commonly in the posttransplant period using Bmode ultrasonography The majority of these collections are small and will require careful observation only or they will resolve with a single aspiration Aggressive diagnostic and therapeutic measures are used only for those collections that are symptomatic or result in allograft dysfunction A rational approach to the diagnosis and treatment of peritransplant fluid collections is described in the form of an algorithm
S644	Highresolution transvaginal ultrasonography may recognize structures in the first and early secondtrimester fetus In a patient with pregestational diabetes caudal regression syndrome in the fetus was diagnosed using transvaginal ultrasonography At 9 weeks of gestation a shortening of the crownrump length and a protuberance of the lower spine suggested caudal regression syndrome By 17 weeks of gestation the diagnosis was made with certainty The transvaginal approach has changed the role of firsttrimester ultrasound in the diabetic pregnancy We suggest that transvaginal ultrasonography be used for purposes of accurate dating and for early detection of diabetic embryopathy particularly in patients with poor periconceptional glycemic control
S645	The fluoroquinolone ofloxacin exhibits a broad antibacterial spectrum Based on our data and a review of the literature ofloxacin inhibited essentially 100 percent of staphylococci including oxacillinresistant strains Haemophilus influenzae Neisseria spp and Branhamella catarrhalis Ninetyfive percent of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to ofloxacin Pseudomonas aeruginosa and enterococci were less susceptible 79 and 63 percent respectively were susceptible minimal inhibitory concentration MIC less than or equal to 20 microgramsml 15 and 25 percent respectively were intermediate MIC 4 microgramsml 3 and 6 percent respectively were resistant MIC more than or equal to 4 microgramsml Clostridium spp including Clostridium difficile were resistant to ofloxacin but other anaerobic species including the Bacteroides fragilis group over 90 percent were either susceptible or intermediate to ofloxacin Ofloxacin is bactericidal minimal bactericidal concentrations of ofloxacin rarely exceed the MICs by one doubling concentration A modest inoculum effect has been observed with ofloxacin MICs with inocula of 107 colonyforming unitsml are often two to fourfold higher than those with inocula of 5 x 105 colonyforming unitsml Susceptible organisms exposed serially to increasing concentrations of nalidixic acid developed increasing resistance to not only nalidixic acid but also to all other quinolones including ofloxacin Correlations of disk diffusion inhibitory zone diameters using the 5micrograms ofloxacin disk with ofloxacin MICs have been performed and the disk diffusion zone diameter breakpoints recommended are susceptible greater than or equal to 16 mm intermediate 13 to 15 mm resistant less than or equal to 12 mm Quality control parameters also are summarized
S646	We recruited 71 previously untreated patients with metastatic prostatic carcinoma to 2 separate consecutive prospective phase 2 studies done by the same group of investigators according to the same protocols in which only the treatment regimens differed Of the patients 58 were treated with the luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone analogue buserelin alone 04 mg 3 times daily intranasally and 13 were treated with buserelin combined with cyproterone acetate a potent antiandrogen 50 mg 3 times daily orally The objective of the study was to investigate the efficacy safety and tolerability of the medication used during at least 12 months by studying adequate endocrine parameters the rate and duration of response as well as the rate of progression and possible side effects All endocrine parameters were studied in 1 laboratory Modified response criteria of the National Prostatic Cancer Project were used The endocrine studies showed an effective suppression of plasma testosterone to castration levels by buserelin after an initial increase during the first 2 weeks Luteinizing hormone and folliclestimulating hormones were lowered significantly and could not be restimulated by the intravenous application of luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone There was no correlation of plasma testosterone with response and progression However a significant correlation existed between higher basal cortisol levels at entry and after 3 and 6 months and progression Response is reported for all patients at the 12month interval and did not seem to differ among treatment groups The rate of progression after all patients had been treated for 1 year was 379 per cent in the buserelin group and 41 per cent in the buserelin plus cyproterone acetate group Three early deaths occurred in the buserelin group Except for impotence only mild side effects were noted Our study shows that treatment of metastatic prostatic cancer by means of the luteinizinghormonereleasing hormone analogue buserelin is safe and effective The results obtained are compatible with those obtained by castration In our study a superiority of total androgen withdrawal over testicular suppression alone could not be shown
S647	Benign intraductal papilloma is a rare lesion in the male breast The authors report the occurrence of an intraductal papilloma in a male with more than a tenyear history of phenothiazine therapy Mellaril and Prolixin Phenothiazines have been demonstrated to cause elevated serum prolactin levels The literature regarding the relationship between prolactin and mammary tumors in rodents and in humans remains controversial The occurrence of this rare male breast tumor in the setting of chronic phenothiazine therapy raises further questions as to the role of prolactin in the development of mammary tumors
S648	The Pgp1 glycoprotein was identified on a minor 27 subset of peripheral Lyt2 or L3T4 T cells In contrast mature medullarytype thymocytes Lyt2 L3T4 Lyt2 L3T4 were nearly devoid of cells expressing detectable surface Pgp1 The appearance of peripheral Pgp1 T cells was found to be thymus dependent as demonstrated by the diminished proportion of Pgp1 T cells after thymectomy and their virtual absence in athymic nude mice The subsequent acquisition of surface Pgp1 was found to be a stable differentiation event occurring concomitantly with primary antigenic stimulation selected Pgp1 mature T cells from thymus or periphery acquired constitutive expression of Pgp1 after stimulation in vitro with alloantigen or mitogens These observations were extended by studies in vivo showing that immunization with various antigens augmented the percentage of Pgp1 spleen cells within the Lyt2 subset Furthermore the frequencies of antigenspecific CTLp after immunization by any of three different antigens tested were greatly enriched in the Pgp1 compared with the Pgp1 subpopulations Peritoneal exudate Lyt2 cells after a localized allograft rejection demonstrated a particularly prominent Pgp1 subpopulation 78 that contained virtually all the allospecific cytolytic activity A model consistent with all of these data proposes that mature thymocytes lacking surface Pgp1 upon emigration to the periphery acquire its expression at the time of primary antigenic stimulation Hence expression of Pgp1 among peripheral T cells is an important differentiation marker for identifying antigenstimulated memory T cells
S649	The records of 5898 patients with colorectal cancer and 27687 controls were examined for previous cholecystectomy The estimated relative risks and 95 confidence intervals of development of any cancer of the large bowel and cancer of the right colon after cholecystectomy were 10 0812 and 11 0815 in women and 11 0915 and 12 0819 in men respectively Although these data do not rule out a small increase in risk it is proposed that the association found in some other studies is at least in part an artifact Intense diagnostic effort and treatment aimed at mild abdominal symptoms encouraged by some patients and some medical care settings could increase the detection and removal of gallstones and the early detection of colorectal cancer
S650	Eight GPs identified 78 heartsink patients in an openended interview they were asked to explain why they regarded them in this way A GPs definition of a heartsink patient was influenced by GP sex practice location and time of surgery although the number of participating GPs was too low to make any definite assertions Practitioners anticipations of heartsink consultations were generally overexaggerated with most of the encounters going better than expected GPs expressed the view that these patients raised serious professional issues for them whilst there was also a dislike for these patients personalities and behaviour Two levels of the heartsink state are hypothesized one a state of inertia is when the heartsink patient has been a chronic high user of the primary health care system and a GP has exhausted all avenues The other is an acute situation with those heartsink patients who have been low users of the system in the past Recent new events in these patients lives have raised an issue that is just as much to do with patient and doctor reaction to these events as it is about finding a diagnosis or solution to the problem We present the results and hypotheses to provoke further discussion and research
S651	The effects of alpha and betaadrenergic blockade on electrocortical activityrelated cyclic variability in fetal heart rate and mean arterial pressure were investigated in eight fetal lambs between 119 and 138 days of gestation In the absence of adrenergic blockade fetal heart rate during highvoltage slow activity was significantly higher than that during lowvoltage fast activity Propranolol 20 mghr produced a decrease in fetal heart rate but the decrease was only statistically significant during highvoltage slow activity Phentolamine 50 mghr induced a significant increase in fetal heart rate with a small but statistically significant decrease in mean arterial pressure The cyclic variability in fetal heart rate between lowvoltage fast activity and highvoltage slow activity was abolished by propranolol and enhanced by phentolamine These results indicate that the cyclic variability in the fetal heart rate associated with electrocortical activity can be accounted for by cyclic fluctuation in sympathetic activity
S652	The delivery of dextrose solutions to the duodenum is associated with the stimulation of phasic and tonic pyloric contraction In this study the effects of intravenous atropine on the antropyloroduodenal motor responses to intraduodenal infusions of 25 dextrose were assessed in 10 normal volunteers Antropyloroduodenal pressures were recorded with a manometric assembly incorporating a sleeve sensor spanning the pylorus and sideholes in the antrum and duodenum In each experiment three intraduodenal infusions of 25 dextrose were given at a rate of 4 mlmin for a median duration of 19 min range 1720 During the second dextrose infusion intravenous atropine was given as a bolus 15 microgramskg followed by an infusion 4 microgramskgmin which was continued until the end of each experiment Before atropine was given the pyloric motor response to the second dextrose infusion was not significantly different from the response to the first infusion but after administration of atropine there was a rapid decrease in the rate of isolated pyloric pressure waves from 08 to 01 per minute p less than 005 The isolated pyloric pressure wave response to the third dextrose infusion was completely blocked and there was a much smaller maximum increase in basal pyloric pressure compared with the first infusion p less than 001 This study indicates that intraduodenal dextrose reproducibly stimulates isolated pyloric pressure waves and increases basal pyloric pressure by mechanisms that involve muscarinic receptors
S653	Sustainedrelease theophylline SRT therapy was monitored in ambulatory children with asthma by measuring theophylline in citric acidstimulated saliva Ninetysix aroundtheclock saliva theophylline profiles were performed in 59 children median age 83 years under routine life conditions Five to seven stimulated saliva samples were collected by parents at home during a 24hour period Highest Cmax and lowest Cmin saliva theophylline concentrations SalTC were not consistently found after or before medication respectively Cmax occurred during morning hours before or after medication in 82 of patients Cmax was found immediately before morning or evening dose in as many as 25 of patients Cmin occurred in 70 of children during evening hours Cmin was found 4 hours after morning or evening dose in 19 of patients Excessive fluctuation in SalTC between pre and postSRT doses during both day and night hours occurred in six patients 286  87 mean  SD Marked circadian variation in SalTC was disclosed in 23 of children The first profile performed was therapeutically satisfactory in only 39 of patients satisfactory profiles were achieved in other children after changing daily SRT dose or dosing interval Determination of theophylline concentration in stimulated saliva specimens obtained frequently during a 24hour period and under routine life conditions is practical and extremely valuable for close monitoring and individualization of theophylline therapy in ambulatory children with asthma
S654	Successful heterotopic and denervated pancreas allograft transplantation PAT often results in normoglycemia and peripheral hyperinsulinemia in insulindependent type I diabetic recipients The contribution of altered hepatic insulin extraction HIE to the resulting hyperinsulinemia in such patients remains uncertain Furthermore whether the denervated pancreas allografts exhibit betacell hyperresponsiveness to physiological and pharmacological stimulation is controversial We evaluated betacell function and HIE after successful whole cadaveric PAT with systemic venous drainage in 13 type I diabetic patients before and after mixedmeal and intravenous glucose and glucagon administration The results were compared with those of 5 nondiabetic patients with kidney transplantation only who had native innervated pancreases with portal insulin delivery and were receiving an equivalent triple immunosuppressive therapy cyclosporin azathioprine and prednisone and 7 healthy control subjects with no family history of diabetes After PAT fasting and poststimulation serum glucose concentrations were normalized PAT was associated with marked basal hyperinsulinemia 3 to 8fold as assessed by immunoreactive insulin IRI levels in type I diabetic patients mean  SE 345  43 pM compared with control subjects 43  14 pM and nondiabetic kidneytransplantation patients 129  38 pM After mixedmeal ingestion the mean incremental integrated insulin area was similar in PAT patients 18  3 nMmin compared with kidneytransplantation patients 20  4 nMmin and healthy control subjects 21  3 nMmin Basal serum Cpeptide levels were significantly greater in PAT 172  013 nM and kidneytransplantation 215  033 nM patients than in healthy control subjects 050  010 nM P less than 001ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S655	The cytologic features of five cases of hyalinizing trabecular adenoma of the thyroid are reviewed All of these cases had been initially interpreted as either suspicious or positive for malignancy On retrospective review many of the cytologic features did mimic those of other lesions particularly papillary carcinoma The smears tended to hypercellularity and nuclei were often slightly enlarged with pale chromatin intranuclear holes and longitudinal grooving of the nuclear membrane On the other hand some cytologic features were more suggestive of medullary carcinomapoor cohesion of cells with elongated and spindle cell forms and hyaline acellular areas Awareness of the histologic and cytologic features of hyalinizing trabecular adenoma may enable the cytopathologist to avoid a false positive diagnosis of papillary carcinoma or medullary carcinoma although it is unrealistic to expect a definitive diagnosis of hyalinizing trabecular adenoma
S656	Uvulopalatopharygoplasty has become widely performed for chronic snoring and for cases of obstructive sleep apnoea Unfortunately this operation is not without morbidity and complications We report our results of a prospective series of 50 patients undergoing uvulopalatopharyngoplasty with a minimum followup of one year Snoring was abolished in 18 36 per cent and substantially reduced in the remainder Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome identified in 11 patients preoperatively was reduced in severity in all but three Troublesome complications were seen in 18 36 per cent patients namely intermittent velopharyngeal incompetence in five 10 per cent pharyngeal dryness in 11 22 per cent and loss of taste in five 10 per cent One patient had nasopharyngeal stenosis requiring correction A cautious approach to this operation is required with rigorous case selection The importance of full assessment and careful followup should not be underestimated
S657	A series of 21 patients with atypical and malignant meningiomas is presented Histological criteria such as high cellularity typical and atypical mitosis necrosis infiltration of the underlying brain poor differentiation and distant metastasis define nonbenign meningiomas Male predominance in this nonbenign group is significant when compared to a group of 205 benign meningiomas which were also operated on The malignant and atypical meningiomas are compared with the benign meningiomas and special emphasis is placed on their computed tomographic features The presence of tumor fringes suggesting invasion of the brain substance and intratumoral hypodense areas were both significant signs of malignancy of atypia Radical surgical excision is still considered the treatment of choice
S658	Among the recognized complications of retrobulbar anesthesia postoperative permanent diplopia has rarely been reported We describe two patients with inferior rectus muscle restriction after retrobulbar anesthesia for cataract extraction and intraocular lens implantation Both did well after inferior rectus recession with placement of an adjustable suture
S659	Binocular neurons in the visual cortex are thought to perform the first stage of processing for the fine stereoscopic depth discrimination exhibited by animals with frontally located eyes Because lateral separation of the eyes gives a slightly different view to each eye there are small variations in position disparities mainly along the horizontal dimension between corresponding features in the two retinal images The visual system uses these disparities to gauge depth We studied neurons in the cats visual cortex to determine whether the visual system uses the anisotropy in the range of horizontal and vertical disparities We report here that there is a corresponding anisotropy in the cortical representation of binocular information receptivefield profiles for left and right eyes are matched for cells that are tuned to horizontal orientations of image contours For neurons tuned to vertical orientations left and right receptive fields are predominantly dissimilar Therefore a major modification is required of the conventional notion of disparity processing The modified scheme allows a unified encoding of monocular form and binocular disparity information
S660	In the present study the authors investigated the mechanism by which Al3 preincubations inhibited the pathologic calcification of glutaraldehydepretreated bovine pericardium GPBP implanted subdermally in rats The concentration dependency of the Al3 anticalcification effect was compared with that of other trivalent metal ions Fe3 Ga3 La3 known to interact with calcium phosphates In vitro incubations of GPBP were carried out in AlCl3 103 moll molar to 101 moll to ascertain both the optimal conditions for uptake of Al3 and the time course of Al3 dissociation Al3 uptake by GPBP was concentration dependent and occurred rapidly with tissue levels after 1 hour not differing significantly from those after 72 hours of incubation Analyses of GPBP samples preincubated in AlCl3 01 moll 24 hours showed that more than 75 of the Al3 remained tightly bound after 60 days in vitro release at 37 degrees C pH 74 Preincubations of GPBP in AlCl3 significantly inhibited calcification after subdermal implantation in rats for 60 days Ca  51  09 microgrammg 115  46 microgramsmg 703  230 microgramsmg mean  standard error SE for 101 moll 102 moll 103 moll AlCl3 respectively compared with controls Ca  1100  93 microgramsmg All animals were free of Al3mediated adverse effects on bone as determined by light microscopic evaluation of femoral epiphyseal growth plates Transmission electron microscopy coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy EELS of GPBP incubated in 101 mol l AlCl3 for 24 hours demonstrated discrete Al3 localization in the sarcolemma and cytoplasmic and nuclear membranes of devitalized pericardial connective tissue cells at intracellular sites coincident with phosphorus loci Similar intracellular localization remained prominent in explants removed after 60 days no calcific deposits were noted in these specimens Preincubations in Fe3 but not Ga3 and La3 solutions yielded significant inhibition of GPBP calcification which did not differ significantly from that provided by Al3 and had a comparable concentration dependency Light microscopic examination Prussian blue staining and EELS of FeCl3preincubated explants demonstrated Fe3 localization within devitalized GPBP connective tissue cells The authors conclude that Al3 and Fe3 significantly inhibit the pathologic mineralization of glutaraldehydepretreated bovine pericardium by mechanisms that are likely related to the high affinity of these cations for membrane associated and other intracellular phosphorus loci
S661	Pulmonary artery diastolic pressure PAD is often used to estimate left ventricular enddiastolic pressure LVEDP when artifact respiratory variation or technical difficulties make the wedge pressure difficult to identify on the waveform To determine which point on the PAD waveform best estimated LVEDP we performed studies in 100 adults undergoing routine diagnostic cardiac catheterization During normal spontaneous respiration simultaneous recordings of the electrocardiogram PAD and LVEDP were obtained Three endexpiratory measurements of PAD were recorded at the lowest point on the waveform PAD at 004 seconds PAD 004 and at 008 seconds PAD 008 after the onset of the QRS complex The PADs were correlated with LVEDP by linear regression PAD 008 correlated best with LVEDP r  088 standard error of the estimate SEE  36 mm Hg whereas PAD 004 and PAD correlated slightly less strongly r  086 SEE  40 mm Hg r  082 SEE  44 mm Hg respectively Therefore when the wedge pressure is not easily determined PAD 008 may be the best point on the waveform to use when attempting to estimate LVEDP in the clinical setting
S662	One hundred and seventeen children and 41 teachers in day nurseries were screened for cytomegalovirus CMV viruria over a period of one year Thirty two 27 children and two 5 teachers were found to be excreting virus on at least one occasion Restriction endonuclease typing showed that virus strains isolated from the children were dissimilar with the exception of those from sibling pairs and one unrelated pair The virus isolate from one teacher matched those from two unrelated children while the isolate from another teacher could not be distinguished from that from a sibling pair The CMV serological state of the 41 teachers was not significantly different from 500 matched controls and no seroconversions occurred It is concluded that although transmission of CMV among children and teachers may occur in day nurseries the dissimilarity of most of the virus strains indicates that infection predominantly occurs outside Furthermore teachers in day nurseries showed no evidence of an increased risk of past CMV infection when compared with matched controls
S663	This is a report of the results of a study of all patients who received cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR for an inhospital cardiac arrest in a community hospital from July 1983 through June 1984 Out of 121 patients 46 survived the initial arrest but only 13 11 percent survived to leave the hospital The patients age or sex were not predictors of survival to leave the hospital Patients who were living independently prior to hospitalization had a higher survival rate 19 percent than homebound 3 percent or nursing home 3 percent patients Patients with acute myocardial infarctions or cardiac arrhythmias had better survival rates 26 percent and 19 percent respectively than with other diagnosis 5 percent but this difference did not reach statistical significance Patients who survived to leave the hospital did not suffer any mental loss from the arrest General guidelines for withholding CPR based on the present study and a review of the literature are presented

S665	In Saccharopolyspora erythraea the genes that govern synthesis of the polyketide portion of the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin are organized in six repeated units that encode fatty acid synthase FASlike activities Each repeated unit is designated a module and two modules are contained in a single open reading frame A model for the synthesis of this complex polyketide is proposed where each module encodes a functional synthase unit and each synthase unit participates specifically in one of the six FASlike elongation steps required for formation of the polyketide In addition genetic organization and biochemical order of events appear to be colinear Evidence for the model is provided by construction of a selected mutant and by isolation of a polyketide of predicted structure
S666	We have assessed the binding characteristics of a structurally novel calcium entry blocker SR 33557 to purified rat heart sarcolemma SR 33557 prevented completely the binding of 3HPN200110 3HD888 and cis3Hdiltiazem to their specific binding sites in an apparently competitive manner nH congruent to 10 and with a high affinity Ki  0520 nM Equilibrium and kinetic studies suggest that SR 33557 does not act as a simple competitive antagonist at the 14dihydropyridine the phenylalkylamine or the benzothiazepineselective sites associated with the Ltype calcium channel 1 inhibition of 3HD888 and cis3Hdiltiazem binding by SR 33557 resulted in a decrease in maximum binding 2 cisdiltiazem and PN200110 allosterically increased the inhibition of 3HPN200110 binding and of 3HD888 and cis3Hdiltiazem binding by SR 33557 respectively and 3 dissociation kinetics of the three radioligands were accelerated by SR 33557 Calcium in millimolar concentrations decreased the apparent affinity of SR 33557 for its highaffinity binding sites This observation was similar to that seen with the phenylalkylamines and cisdiltiazem but contrasted from that seen with the 14dihydropyridines These results indicate that SR 33557 interacts with a high affinity to a novel binding site associated with the Ltype calcium channel and has a strong negative allosteric interaction with the wellcharacterized binding sites for 14dihydropyridines phenylalkylamines and benzothiazepines
S667	Diets containing 13 protein supplied by wheat gluten WG wheat gluten  lysine  threonine WGLT or casein  methionine CM were fed to pregnant rats from conception through day 15 of lactation A crossover design was used with combinations of WG WGLT and CM during pregnancy and lactation Out of six dams fed WG during both pregnancy and lactation and nursing a total of 48 pups on day 1 of lactation only two pups were still alive on day 15 of lactation In contrast CM dams still were nursing 47 pups at this time Differences in the weight and composition of mammary tissue were directionally similar to and consistent with pup viability The data obtained confirm the importance of protein quality in the lactation diet and also demonstrate that deficits in mammary gland development occurring during pregnancy may not necessarily be overcome by a nutritionally adequate diet consumed during lactation
S668	Various mechanisms have been suggested to explain the high prevalence of ventricular arrhythmia in patients with heart failure but as yet there is no unifying theory There is growing evidence that changes in myocardial mechanical properties may directly alter cardiac electrophysiology by a process of mechanoelectric feedback Moreover when changes in cardiac loading similar to those seen in heart failure are produced experimentally in normal heart there is a greater tendency to arrhythmogenesis The intimate relation between changes in mechanical function and arrhythmia in heart failure could account for the lack of effect of most conventional antiarrhythmic drugs on arrhythmogenesis and the beneficial effect of peripheral vasodilators This paper argues that mechanically induced changes in electrophysiology are very important in the development of arrhythmia in cardiac failure there may be no need to implicate other mechanisms such as relative ischaemia metabolic changes or changes in sympathetic tone
S669	The purposes of this study were to investigate the effect of a superactive agonistic analog of gonadotropinreleasing hormone nafarelin on uterine leiomyomas and to assess the use of magnetic resonance imaging in monitoring uterine and myoma size Eleven women with uterine leiomyomas were treated with 800 micrograms of nafarelin per day for 6 months Serum gonadotropin and estradiol concentrations were suppressed during treatment The mean  SEM serum luteinizing hormone level decreased from 111  14 to 56  042 mlUml and folliclestimulating hormone from 95  066 to 75  072 mlUml by 3 months of treatment p less than 001 The estradiol level decreased from a pretreatment follicular phase mean  SEM of 43  83 to 198  31 p less than 005 and 148  22 pgml p less than 001 at 3 and 6 months of treatment respectively Mean pretreatment androgen levels testosterone androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate were low in these women and did not change significantly during treatment Ten women had magnetic resonance imaging which provided excellent resolution of individual uterine myomas As assessed by magnetic resonance imaging the largest myoma decreased in size in nine of 10 women the mean decrease was 46  9 Uterine volume decreased in all 10 patients the mean decrease was 57  7 In several women myomas reenlarged after discontinuance of nafarelin treatment Posttreatment myomectomy was carried out in four women there was minimal blood loss and no surgical complications These data indicate that suppression of ovarian estrogen production with nafarelin is associated with a decrease in uterine myoma size in many women but that myomas may regrow with reinstitution of ovarian function Magnetic resonance imaging is an excellent method by which to monitor treatment as changes in the size of the uterus as well as individual myomas can be assessed The optimal use of gonadotropinreleasing hormone analogs may be in perimenopausal women or as presurgical treatment to decrease uterine and myoma size to facilitate myomectomy
S670	A 34week male fetus experienced intrauterine death due to an umbilical cord hematoma Rupture of the hematoma occurred at the time of delivery but compression of the cord vessels and fetal blood loss into the hematoma rather than the rupture itself were the cause of death Membranes had been ruptured for several days prior to the fetal demise and both chorioamnionitis and funisitis were present Inflammation of the umbilical cord as well as a defect in the elastin and smooth muscle components of the vein may have predisposed the cord to development of the hematoma
S671	The effect of the glycosaminoglycan GAG layer on the adherence of Escherichia coli to the bladder urothelium of rats has been studied The study was performed by destroying the GAG layer and the changes were observed using the electron microscope Bacterial adherence to the bladder with a destroyed GAG layer was much higher than to the normal bladder Following the destruction of the GAG layer the instillation of sodium pentosanpolysulphate significantly reduced the adhesion of bacteria Prophylactic intramuscular administration of carbenoxolone increased the speed of regeneration of the destroyed GAG layer
S672	To provide optimal quality of care for the nations cancer patients it is important that the individual identify the cancer early either through screening practices in an asymptomatic state or present themselves with early symptoms to the medical community The primary care practitioner is an equal partner in this early detection of cancer and certainly needs to have significant incentives in place to perform quality screening services as well as health counseling services for their asymptomatic patients and to investigate appropriately symptoms that could indicate early cancer Perhaps of equal importance is the impact on cancer management outcome from the referrals of primary care practitioners to the oncology community This area of cancer management is far less well studied and additional information would be of great help in determining where to place emphasis in professional and community education programs
S673	One hundred thirty patients with lung cancer were studied to determine the incidence of unilateral thoracic softtissue accumulation UTS of 99mTc methylene diphosphonate MDP The finding was present in 60 of 130 46 of the patients Of 52 patients who had received radiation therapy to the primary tumor in the chest 46 88 had UTS while six 12 did not Radiation therapy to lung tumors was the most significant of the factors studied in unilateral softtissue uptake of bone agent in the thorax of patients with lung cancer
S674	Two related cats aged 5 months and 7 months and 1 unrelated cat aged 4 months presented with signs of a progressive neuromuscular disease Detailed electrophysiological studies suggested a primary demyelinating polyneuropathy which was confirmed by muscle and nerve biopsies and on necropsy examination Light and electron microscopic findings indicated a lysosomal storage disease which was diagnosed as sphingomyelinase deficiency NiemannPick disease by enzyme analysis and lipid fractionation although significant biochemical differences existed between the 2 related cats and the third cat Several lines of evidence suggest that these 2 related cats were affected with a variant of type A NiemannPick disease whereas cat 3 represented classic NiemannPick disease type A
S675	Calcification of the ligamentum arteriosum is a rare finding on plain radiographs We commonly have seen the calcification on unenhanced CT scans of the chest a finding not previously reported A retrospective review of unenhanced CT scans of the chest was undertaken to determine the frequency of the described finding Seven 13 of 53 patients had a welldemarcated focus of calcification in the region of the ligamentum arteriosum None of these patients had evidence of a patent ductus arteriosum Calcification within the ligamentum arteriosum was seen in 13 of routine CT examinations of the chest in children and should not be confused with a pathologic process producing mediastinal calcifications
S676	In 1988 the number of Shigella dysenteriae type 1 Sd1 infections reported in the USA increased fivefold over the annual mean from the previous decade 44 94 of 47 interviewed patients reported recent travel to Mexico 33 75 of these had been tourists to the Yucatan peninsula 27 patients who had travelled to Mexico were admitted to hospital of whom 2 had a haemolytic uraemic syndrome none died The antimicrobial resistance pattern and plasmid profile of the Yucatan strain were similar to those of the 196972 pandemic strain Antimicrobial resistances and plasmid profiles were different in sporadic Western hemisphere strains This is the first outbreak of Sd1 among US tourists and it is the largest known outbreak in the Western hemisphere since the early 1970s The dominant Sd1 strain is similar to that which caused the catastrophic 196972 pandemic Surveillance and control measures have been instituted in the Yucatan peninsula
S677	We studied the effects of a new topical angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor SCH 33861 in lowering intraocular pressure in 20 patients with ocular hypertension or primary openangle glaucoma In a doublemasked fourway crossover study with placebo and timolol SCH 33861 was well tolerated and effective in lowering intraocular pressure The magnitude of the drugs effect in lowering intraocular pressure was less than that of timolol 05
S678	The 10day option aimed at restricting all radiography of potentially fertile women to the first third of the menstrual cycle was introduced in 1959 without any valid supporting evidence No earlier or later experimental evidence has indicated that diagnostic radiography involving the early embryo might carry a measurable risk to the individual developing in utero
S679	We have cloned a member of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily of ligandactivated transcription factors The receptor homologue is activated by a diverse class of rodent hepatocarcinogens that causes proliferation of peroxisomes Identification of a peroxisome proliferatoractivated receptor should help elucidate the mechanism of the hypolipidaemic effect of these hepatocarcinogens and aid evaluation of their potential carcinogenic risk to man

S681	Although the TNM system is the accepted standard for head and neck tumor classification there are often discrepancies between tumor size and survival This retrospective analysis of 89 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa was carried out to evaluate tumor thickness and depth of invasion as prognostic variables and to compare them to the standard parameters Recurrence rates increased with tumor size clinical stage thickness and depth of invasion In univariate analysis sex clinical stage thickness and depth of invasion were significantly related to survival p less than 010 Multivariate analysis revealed that only thickness was an independent variable p less than 00001 Patients with tumors less than 6 mm in thickness had a significantly better survival rate compared with those patients with tumors greater than 6 mm in thickness regardless of the tumor stage Measurement of tumor thickness should be included in estimating prognosis planning therapy and comparing results in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the buccal mucosa
S682	The effect of riboflavin deficiency on the fluidity and function of the red blood cell RBC membrane and on the activity of some enzymes involved in antioxidant defense mechanisms was studied Growing male rats were fed an experimental riboflavindeficient or a control riboflavinsupplemented diet Following 7 wk of feeding RBC from riboflavindeficient rats contained higher levels of peroxidation products most likely due to decreased glutathione reductase activity An elevation in glutathione peroxidase activity was also observed whereas the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase was not affected Membrane fluidity was studied by fluorescence polarization using 16diphenyl135 hexatriene DPH as a probe The fluidity of RBC membranes isolated from riboflavindeficient rats was significantly lower than that of the controls This decreased fluidity was accompanied by an increase in the activity of the membranebound enzyme acetylcholinesterase This study demonstrated that a decrease in cells ability to cope with peroxidative damage as a result of riboflavin deficiency may lead to changes in the fluidity and function of membranes
S683	Using an approach for isolating and characterizing peptide fractions that are intracellularly associated with major histocompatibility complex class I molecules the major peptide recognized by cytotoxic T cells specific for the vesicular stomatitis virus has been isolated from the H2Kb molecule of infected cells This endogenously processed octapeptide is allelespecific as it does not bind to H2Db molecules and contains the core sequence of the epitope of the nucleocapsid protein of the vesicular stomatitis virus identified by testing with exogenous synthetic peptides
S684	This study examined 65 patients with ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation late after myocardial infarction to determine whether they differed with respect to duration of ventricular activation in sinus rhythm and left ventricular ejection fraction Patients with spontaneous ventricular tachycardia had a longer ventricular activation time in sinus rhythm than did patients with spontaneous ventricular fibrillation This difference was detected with the signalaveraged electrocardiogram ECG tachycardia 181  33 ms fibrillation 152  23 ms p less than 0001 and at epicardial mapping tachycardia 210  17 ms fibrillation 192  17 ms p less than 002 Left ventricular ejection fraction was lower in patients with spontaneous ventricular tachycardia 022  009 than in patients with spontaneous ventricular fibrillation 027  009 p less than 005 The patients with both spontaneous and inducible ventricular fibrillation had a shorter ventricular activation time on the signalaveraged ECG 129  17 ms and a higher ejection fraction 036  005 than did either patients with spontaneous ventricular fibrillation and inducible ventricular tachycardia 158  21 ms and 025  008 respectively each p less than 001 or patients with both spontaneous and inducible ventricular tachycardia 181  33 ms and 022  009 respectively each p less than 0001 Of the patients with inducible ventricular tachycardia presentation with tachycardia rather than fibrillation was associated with a longer ventricular activation time on the signalaveraged ECG 181  33 versus 158  21 ms p less than 002 and a longer cycle length of inducible ventricular tachycardia 290  61 versus 259  44 ms p  005ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S685	BACKGROUND AND METHODS Acute ethanol intoxication has been shown to depress myocardial performance in both laboratory and clinical studies The present study was designed to examine the effect of acute ethanol intoxication on resuscitation of rats subjected to cardiac arrest Rats were given 12 g moderately intoxicated or 24 g highly intoxicated of ethanolkg or distilled water nonintoxicated rats Using a standardized technique we induced cardiac arrest CPR was then attempted using chest compressions interposed with abdominal compressions Resuscitation was said to be successful if BP returned spontaneously within 6 mins of institution of chest compressions interposed with abdominal compressions and if systolic BP was 50 of its prearrest level within 10 mins of discontinuation of chest compressions interposed with abdominal compressions Mean  SD serum ethanol levels were 1213  129 mgdL 263  28 mmolL moderately intoxicated rats and 2544  346 mgdL 552  75 mmolL highly intoxicated rats RESULTS Resuscitation was successful in 75 1520 of nonintoxicated rats 467 715 of moderately intoxicated rats and 333 515 of highly intoxicated rats The difference in resuscitation rates was significant for nonintoxicated rats compared with either intoxicated rats as a group p  021 or highly intoxicated rats p  019 but was not significant for nonintoxicated rats compared with moderately intoxicated rats CONCLUSION Acute ethanol intoxication appears to decrease the likelihood of successful resuscitation in a dosedependent fashion
S686	In situ hybridization was used to determine the morphologic distribution of tropoelastin and alpha 1I procollagen mRNA expression in elastic intralobar arteries from neonatal calves with hypoxic pulmonary hypertension induced by a 15day exposure to a simulated altitude of 1500 m In vessels from normotensive control animals low levels of hybridizable tropoelastin mRNA were detected in smooth muscle cells SMC of the inner media associated with large elastic lamellae Compared to control arteries vessels from hypertensive animals demonstrated a markedly different pattern of hybridization In these arteries strong hybridization signals for tropoelastin mRNA were seen in SMC lying between the elastic lamellae of the outer media and the density of labeling associated with these medial cells decreased progressively toward the lumen Endothelial and adventitial cells in both control and hypertensive arteries were negative for tropoelastin mRNA Type I procollagen mRNA was dispersed through the media of control arteries and in hypertensive calves the hybridization signal was more intense and was unevenly distributed through the media similarly to that for tropoelastin mRNA Adventitial cells were strongly positive for procollagen mRNA and the signal was equally intense for both control and hypertensive arteries Cells that had no detectable tropoelastin mRNA were noted in the outer media of both control and hypertensive vessels These cells occurred as broad circumferential bands in the normotensive artery and as nodular foci in the hypertensive artery Immunocytochemical studies with antibodies to smooth muscle specific actin desmin and vimentin demonstrated that cells within these foci as well as tropoelastin mRNApositive cells were SMC These studies demonstrate that expression of tropoelastin and procollagen mRNA was differentially stimulated by pulmonary hypertension within specific regions and SMC populations of the vascular wall
S687	In contrast to the usual 21 femalemale ratio for the presence of gallstones we found that the 12 patients with symptomatic gallstones under age 30 in this study were all female This prompted a retrospective study of clinicopathologic findings in these 12 women with gallstones Chemical analyses of the gallstones confirmed that all were cholesterol stones Obesity and pregnancy proved to be the outstanding risk factors The mechanism of obesity and pregnancy as lithogenic factors are reviewed and discussed
S688	The anatomy of human lower lumbar zygapophyseal joint posteromedial fibrous capsules and their synovial folds was investigated by highpower light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy A description of nerves in the posteromedial joint capsule and the synovial folds is presented The diameter of paravascular myelinated nerve fibres in the synovial folds was 02 micron micron Small myelinated nerves 06 to 12 microns course through the synovial folds not in association with bloodvessels suggesting that these nerves are nociceptive and therefore may have clinical significance in spinal pain
S689	A computersimulation model of prehospital hemorrhage and fluid resuscitation was used to determine under what circumstances it is advantageous to begin fluid resuscitation in the field instead of immediately transporting to the hospital Four hypothetical bleeding rates 15 25 50 and 100 mLmin were examined for short and long prehospital times No significant difference in survival was noted for bleeding rates of 15 mLmin for either short or long time a small but statistically significant increase in survival was noted for bleeding rates of 25 mLmin and long transport times For both short and long times all higher bleeding rates showed greater survival with prehospital fluid resuscitation and higher blood pressure at the onset of definitive care
S690	We have studied the molecular mechanisms of the binding and uptake of secretory and serum immunoglobulin A IgA of both subclasses 1 and 2 and molecular forms monomer and polymer by the particulate fraction of human liver homogenate and by a human hepatoma cell line HepG2 Inhibition by asialoorosomucoid and the requirement for the presence of calcium indicated that the binding of secretory IgA and polymeric IgA1 was mediated by the asialoglycoprotein receptor Secretory component which functions as a receptor for polymeric IgA in several animal species was detected in the epithelial cells of bile ducts but not in hepatocytes Secretory IgA and all molecular forms and subclasses of serum IgA were bound by HepG2 cells which do not express secretory component The requirement for the presence of calcium the presence of a terminal galactose residue in IgA and the molecular weight of the major plasma membrane protein responsible for binding 41700 daltons indicated the involvement of asialoglycoprotein receptor Immunoglobulin A proteins bound by HepG2 cells were endocytosed and catabolized
S691	Fortyfour patients with histologically confirmed sarcoidosis were prospectively studied with highresolution computed tomography CT Nodules were seen in all cases They were isolated in 19 cases and associated with other lesions in 25 cases Other abnormalities were irregular interfaces n  18 41 linear network n  14 32 thickening of the pleural surface n  9 20 groundglass opacities n  7 16 lung distortion n  11 25 traction bronchiectasis n  3 7 and network of airfilled cavities n  3 7 Predominant sites of lesions were the upper and middle zones n  30 68 and posterior zones n  13 30 Nodular abnormalities were noted at CT in six cases in which the pulmonary parenchyma appeared normal on radiographs Lung distortion was noted at CT in eight cases without visible fibrosis on chest radiographs The majority of patients with lung distortion nine of 11 82 had disease of greater than a years duration CT improved sensitivity for the detection of all types of lesions mainly lung distortion Low but significant correlations were found between visual score at CT and total lung capacity vital capacity forced expiratory volume in 1 second and diffusing capacity
S692	Serum level of CA125 was monitored up to 48 hours after injection of 125 mg Pinoil into patients with or without endometriosis in the follicular phase of their menstrual cycle Circulating CA125 levels remained unchanged at around 5 Uml during the observation period in patients without endometriosis however a significant elevation was observed at 30 hours after injection in those patients with endometriosis from 196 Uml before injection to 300 Uml at 30 hours after injection P less than 005
S693	We investigated the association between functional status and quality of life in newlyentered dialysis patients and the subsequent risk of mortality We enrolled the patients from 37 dialysis facilities in two southeastern states n  294 Functional status was assessed by the Karnofsky Performance Scale KPS and quality of life by the Spitzer Quality of Life Index SQLI During a mean SE followup of 4796 1094 days 49 patients 164 of the cohort died The mean KPS score SE for survivors was 731 011 and for nonsurvivors was 589 026 P less than 00001 The mean SQLI score SE for survivors was 674 015 and nonsurvivors was 495 028 P less than 00001 Strong gradients of the risk of mortality were found for both measurements After controlling for other covariates including age race sex primary cause of renal failure and the presence of comorbidity both the KPS and SQLI scores were independently correlated with risk of mortality We conclude that functional status and quality of life are strong independent risk factors for subsequent mortality in new dialysis patients These are easily measured indicators which may serve to predict subsequent risk of mortality or adjust casemix estimates for comparisons between dialysis populations
S694	A complementary DNA encoding the human low density lipoprotein LDL receptor under control of the mouse metallothioneinI promoter was injected into fertilized mouse eggs and a strain of mice expressing high levels of LDL receptors was established After administration of cadmium these mice cleared intravenously injected 125Ilabeled LDL from blood eight to ten times more rapidly than did normal mice The plasma concentrations of apoproteins B100 and E the two ligands for the LDL receptor declined by more than 90 percent after cadmium treatment but the concentration of another apoprotein AI was unaffected Therefore overexpression of an endocytotic receptor can dramatically lower the ambient concentration of its ligand in vivo
S695	The enthalpy change delta H accompanying the alphahelix to random coil transition in water has been determined calorimetrically for a 50residue peptide of defined sequence that contains primarily alanine The enthalpy of helix formation is one of the basic parameters needed to predict thermal unfolding curves for peptide helices and it provides a starting point for analysis of the peptide hydrogen bond The experimental uncertainty in delta H reflects the fact that the transition curve is too broad to measure in its entirety which precludes fitting the baselines directly A lower limit for delta H of unfolding 09 kcalmol per residue is given by assuming that the change in heat capacity delta Cp is zero and allowing the baseline to intersect the transition curve at the lowest measured Cp value Use of the vant Hoff equation plus leastsquares fitting to determine a more probable baseline gives delta H  13 kcalmol per residue Earlier studies of polyLlysine and polyLglutamate have given 11 kcalmol per residue Those investigations along with our present result suggest that the side chain has little effect on delta H The possibility that the peptide hydrogen bond shows a correspondingly large delta H and the implications for protein stability are discussed
S696	The use of the laser has become a wellrecognized means of treating obstructing lesions of the tracheobronchial tree Patients with lower airway compromise are in a precarious state of equilibrium Everything done by the endoscopyanesthesiology team tends to change this balance Cooperation and coordination of this welldisciplined team is needed for efficient treatment of difficult cases This paper outlines our surgical techniques which have been tempered and modified to an anesthetic technique that provides the greatest safety with comfort We detail the basic anesthetic methods for drug usage pulmonary ventilation and patient monitoring that we now use A careful analysis of our results is presented to show that this technique does provide relatively safe anesthesia in this difficult setting
S697	A phase I trial of intramuscularly administered recombinant human tumor necrosis factor rTNF was conducted in 19 adult patients with advanced solid tumors The agent was administered daily for up to five consecutive days every other week for two to four courses Doses of rTNF ranged from 5 to 200 microgramsm2d Doselimiting toxicities were encountered at doses greater than 100 microgramsm2d Toxicities included tenderness erythema and induration at the site of injection fatigue fever chills headache anorexia nausea vomiting and diarrhea Moderate to marked reductions in WBC and platelet counts were observed regularly at the highest dose levels but none were clinically significant Hepatic enzyme elevation was seen frequently and two patients developed hyperbilirubinemia Only one of seven patients treated with doses greater than 100 microgramsm2d completed the planned course of therapy Even at the highest dose levels serum concentrations of rTNF could only rarely be detected in the serum No therapeutic responses were observed The maximal tolerated dose MTD of rTNF in this trial was 150 microgramsm2d administered for two courses
S698	Bupivacaine 25 mg kg1 05 ml kg1 of 05 solution with or without adrenaline 5 micrograms ml1 was administered by interpleural injection to 12 patients after elective cholecystectomy Noncompartmental analysis indicated that the addition of adrenaline had no effect on total body clearance apparent volume of distribution at steady state or elimination halflife of bupivacaine However peak plasma concentrations were lower in the adrenaline group mean SD range 257 061 152311 vs 322 027 284353 micrograms ml1 P less than 005 and the time to maximum concentration was delayed median range 25 1530 vs 15 1020 min P less than 005 Analgesia was variable and no differences were detected between the two groups The addition of adrenaline appears prudent to minimize possible bupivacaine toxicity
S699	Between 1981 and 1983 some 85 patients with cystic fibrosis at Rainbow Babies and Childrens Hospital Cleveland developed colonization or infection of the respiratory tract with Pseudomonas cepacia Twentynine 34 percent of the colonized patients died four were female patients with fulminant bacteremia with P cepacia prior to death Casecontrol studies showed that increasing severity of underlying cystic fibrosis increasing age having a sibling with cystic fibrosis who was colonized with P cepacia and previous hospitalizations were associated with increased risk of colonization In patients with mild cystic fibrosis no differences in clinical outcome were seen during the period of study however patients colonized with P cepacia who had moderate or advanced cystic fibrosis were hospitalized longer and died sooner after colonization compared with control subjects with similar severity of cystic fibrosis The excess mortality associated with such colonization varied in magnitude and trend according to the patients sex and severity of underlying cystic fibrosis reflecting the combined influence of colonization with P cepacia sex and severity of cystic fibrosis on the mortality of the patients The source and mode of transmission of P cepacia were not determined but the data suggest a possible nosocomial source The results of this investigation showed that colonization with P cepacia most often affected patients with moderate or advanced cystic fibrosis and was associated with an adverse clinical outcome in these patients
S700	OK432 a compound composed of penicillinGtreated attenuated Streptococcus pyogenes of human origin was administered by intratumoral injection IT to 15 of 49 patients with Stage III gastric carcinoma at the time of preoperative endoscopic examination The 5year survival rate of patients given IT was 733 whereas the rate was only 365 in those not given IT P less than 005 A study of recurrent cases revealed a significantly low incidence of peritoneal recurrence in the group on OK432 IT P less than 001 In previous work the authors noted a favorable prognosis of patients with Stage III gastric carcinoma and with a marked infiltration of Langerhans cells LC in the tumor tissues All of the 49 in the current study were thus examined immunohistochemically using antiS100 protein antibody the objective being to clarify the relationship between OK432 IT and the density of LC The density of LC among those given IT was significantly increased as compared with those not given IT P less than 005 The results of this study suggest that OK432 IT may lead to augmentation of the density of LC in tumor tissues and hence prevent peritoneal recurrences in patients with Stage III gastric carcinoma
S701	Defective odontogenesis andor retarded eruption of teeth can be associated with histologic features akin to odontogenic fibroma in the dental follicles Unerupted mandibular premolar and molar teeth of a 24yearold man were surgically exposed yet the teeth failed to erupt About a year and a half later radiographs indicated further enlargement of the follicle of the premolar and both teeth were subsequently surgically removed Histologically the follicles were composed of mature collagenous tissue among which epithelial islands and numerous clusters of calcified bodies were present Indirect immunofluorescence showed positive staining for type I and type III collagen which exhibited a sparse distribution but not for the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen The hamartomatous nature of the lesions is discussed with emphasis on their histologic resemblance to the WHO type of odontogenic fibroma
S702	Nutritional repletion in cancer reverses malnutrition and its associated immunodepression but whether it benefits the hosttumor outcome has been variable This study hypothesizes that such nutritional support will only favor that host generating a potent antitumor immune response Murine neuroblastoma NB was characterized into immunizing C1300NB and nonimmunizing TBJNB cell lines and 100 6weekold strain A mice were assigned on day 14 to isocaloric dietary groups 24 or 25 protein At day 0 mice received either C1300NB or TBJNB on day 7 one half of the 25 group mice were repleted with 24 protein on day 21 tumor weightcarcass weight TC and mortality M were noted Body weight increased 128 in the 24 group and fell 114 in the 25 group p less than 001 The TC ratios were smaller for immunogenic C1300NB on 24 protein compared with 25 chow 00033 versus 00229 p less than 002 Repletion produced smaller tumors in the C1300NB host strikingly repletion of TBJNB mice significantly increased tumor burden TC  00186 versus 01657 p less than 001 and also increased animal mortality M  20 to 30 p  NS These data suggest that the influence of nutritional repletion on the tumorbearing host varies specifically with the presence of an antitumor immune response
S703	A 72yearold woman developed a hyphaema on the first postoperative day after a combined trabeculectomy and extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation On the second day the blood had redistributed to accumulate in the bag posterior to the intraocular lens and had formed a fluid level Postural drainage helped to clear the hyphaema from both locations with no shortterm effect on visual function or the filtering bleb
S704	A 52yearold woman with fever and low grade hepatitis had Q fever a diagnosis made by the characteristic granulomas containing fibrin and vacuoles on liver biopsy and confirmed by serology Fibrin was demonstrated in the granulomas but Coxiella burnetii antigens were not The literature on the histopathology of the liver in both acute Q fever and Q fever endocarditis shows that none of the 220 cases of Q fever endocarditis with one possible exception had the characteristic granulomas of acute Q fever Rather they displayed a range from normality through nonspecific reactive hepatitis to occasional nonspecific granulomas Thus the characteristic granulomas of acute Q fever appear to be transient even if active infection persists The definition of chronic Q fever should have a temporal characteristic rather than a serologic one
S705	Previous in vitro studies showed that Ca and 125OH2D3 modulate peritoneal macrophage PM0 antimicrobial activity in CAPD patients Twentyfour CAPD patients were evaluated in vivo 12 who had never had peritonitis and 12 with an overall peritonitis incidence of more than one episode per 8 patientmonths for the effects of different peritoneal dialysis fluids PDF and Ca concentrations 125 175 and 225 mmolL on PM0 cytoplasmic Ca concentration superoxide generation leukotriene B4 LTB4 release and bacterial killing for Staphylococcus epidermidis The same parameters were also evaluated after adding 125OH2D3 025 microgramL to the PDF Results showed a direct correlation between the PDF Ca concentration and PM0 Ca levels superoxide and LTB4 generation and bacterial killing such that with 225 mmolL of Ca these values were significantly higher than those seen with 175 mmolL The addition of 125OH2D3 potentiated the Cainduced effects On the other hand with PDF Ca levels of 125 mmolL an inhibition of the aforementioned parameters was seen However this effect was reversed by the addition of 125OH2D3 These in vivo results confirm the importance of Ca and 125OH2D3 in PM0 antibacterial function in CAPD patients and may be useful in determining the prophylaxis and therapy of peritonitis
S706	In a study undertaken to determine compliance with Universal Precautions we observed 129 personnel performing 1274 interventions on 151 consecutive critically ill and injured patients in an emergency department setting in July 1988 Barrier precautions were fully adhered to 440 of the time During interventions in patients with profuse bleeding adherence was only 195 in contrast to 447 for those who were not bleeding Adherence was 564 during minor interventions but only 167 during major procedures Adherence rates varied among health care providers residents 58 emergency staff physicians 38 consultant physicians 43 emergency nursing staff 44 paramedics 8 radiology technicians 14 and housekeeping 91 In a follow up questionnaire that ascertained reasons for lack of compliance 47 of providers indicated that there was not always sufficient time to put on protective material 33 felt that precautions interfered with skillful performance of procedures and 23 stated that materials were uncomfortable Only 27 felt that Universal Precautions did not work Since there is no proven postexposure prophylaxis for human immunodeficiency virus Universal Precautions must be rigorously followed until such time as they are shown not to be effective or an alternate approach is developed Strategies to improve compliance and improvements in barrier technology need to be developed
S707	Communicable diseases represent a considerable burden in terms of suffering and costs The decision to develop a new vaccine varies with perspectives The public health perspective is influenced largely by costbenefit ratios the community perspective by a strong desire to alleviate suffering and disability from disease and from vaccine sideeffects and that of vaccine producers by demand technological feasibility of development and anticipated return on investment Each of these perspectives is important However they often are mutually exclusive From a humanitarian and epidemiological perspective the most urgent needs related to communicable diseases are those of the poorest countries in the industrialised world with the exception of the vaccine for the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS public health priorities evaluated in terms of the costbenefit ratio often differ from those of the market which usually selects its priorities according to return on investment The six vaccines used in the Expanded Programme of Immunisation EPI are offered cheaply through a highly efficient bidding system It would have to be extended under the same form or differently to other vaccines such as those for rabies hepatitis B or japanese encephalitis For vaccines that are being developed such as conjugated polysaccharide or acellular pertussis vaccines it is difficult to foresee how these expensive vaccines can be distributed The situation is even worse for vaccines to be developed specifically for the third world To make these vaccines available to everyone there must be technology that enables producers to sharply reduce production costs and a subsidy for research and development and production
S708	Thirtysix patients with AIDS and cultureproven nontuberculous mycobacteriosis were compared to 20 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS and tuberculosis with regard to clinical signs symptoms and diagnostic methods Patients with nontuberculous mycobacteriosis were more often younger and homosexuals while patients with tuberculosis were usually HaitianAmerican or users of intravenous drugs A majority of patients with tuberculosis presented with fever and weight loss These symptoms were seen in approximately 50 percent of the patients with nontuberculous mycobacteriosis A distinct syndrome of dyspnea chills hemoptysis and chest pain was seen in a significant minority of patients with nontuberculous mycobacteriosis Lymphadenopathy was seen almost exclusively in patients with tuberculosis Pulmonary sources expectorated sputum or bronchoscopy specimens were the most common source of diagnosis in both groups Patients in both groups in whom the diagnosis was obtained from pulmonary sources frequently had negative chest xray films on presentation Cavitary disease was absent from both groups
S709	This study contrasts body compositions by six methods of eight cystic fibrosis CF subjects with those of eight control subjects matched for age height and sex CF subjects weighed 84 as much as control subjects Densitometry and two bioelectrical impedanceanalysis methods suggested that reduced CF weights were due to less lean tissue 107 95 and 104 kg Totalbody electrical conductivity TOBEC and skinfoldthickness measurements indicated that CF subjects were leaner than control subjects and had less fat 54 and 36 kg and less lean 52 and 7 kg tissue D2O dilution showed a pattern similar to TOBEC 83 kg less lean 27 kg less fat tissue Densitometry estimates of fat mass and percent were not correlated r less than 074 p greater than 005 with any other method for CF subjects but were correlated with all other methods for control subjects CF subjects contained less fat and lean tissue than did control subjects Densitometry by underwater weighing is unsuitable for assessing body composition of CF patients
S710	Human neutrophils exposed to proteincoated polystyrene or cultured endothelial monolayers produce large quantities of H2O2 in response to soluble stimuli that elicit little or no secretion of reactive oxygen species from cells in suspension To characterize the mechanisms involved in this adherencedependent respiratory burst we have investigated the possible role of one integrin known to participate in the adhesion of neutrophils to endothelial cells CD11bCD18 Mac1 H2O2 production was examined with chemotactic factorstimulated human and canine neutrophils exposed to proteincoated surfaces and cultured human and canine endothelial cells The two proteincoated surfaces used were type I collagencoated glass or plastic a surface to which neither human nor canine neutrophils adhered and keyhole limpet hemocyanin KLHcoated glass or plastic a surface to which human and canine neutrophils adhered only after chemotactic stimulation FMLPstimulated human neutrophils and platelet activating factorstimulated canine neutrophils failed to produce detectable H2O2 when in contact with type I collagen but secreted large amounts of H2O2 when adherent to KLH or endothelial cell monolayers FMLPstimulated neutrophils from patients with CD18deficiency failed to adhere to any of these surfaces and failed to produce H2O2 under these conditions mAb reactive with CD18 and CD11b were equally effective in markedly inhibiting the adhesion of normal human neutrophils to these surfaces and markedly inhibited the production of H2O2 A mAb reactive with CD18 blocked adhesion of stimulated canine neutrophils and mAb directed against both CD18 and CD11b blocked H2O2 production by canine neutrophils on KLH and endothelium A nonbinding mAb and a mAb reactive with CD11a did not inhibit H2O2 production of human cells on KLH or endothelial monolayers and nonbinding and binding control mAb did not inhibit H2O2 production by canine neutrophils These results indicate that Mac1 CD11bCD18 can mediate adhesiondependent H2O2 production by human and canine neutrophils exposed to chemotactic factors
S711	This study was undertaken to determine the incidence and duration of diarrhea associated with tube feeding in critically ill adult patients who require mechanical ventilation Of the 73 subjects studied 63 had diarrhea associated with tube feeding This incidence is higher than that reported from other studies of critically ill patients who were not mechanically ventilated Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that three variables higher rates of infusion greater tubefeeding osmolality and change of tubefeeding product were statistically significant predictors of diarrhea incidence Antibiotic use and serum albumin levels were not predictors In a stepwise multiple regression analysis the duration of diarrhea was predicted by frequency of diarrhea within the first 5 days of tubefeeding onset tubefeeding product osmolality and rate of tubefeeding infusion Serum albumin levels and frequency of diarrhea beyond 6 days of tubefeeding onset did not predict duration of diarrhea Higher osmolality and infusion rates of tubefeeding products did contribute to prediction of both incidence and duration of diarrhea
S712	We evaluated the pulmonary circulatory effects of emphysema produced by papain in 6 dogs that received 4 weekly treatments of papain administered by aerosolization A control group of 6 dogs received saline treatments Hemodynamic measurements were performed during normoxic and hypoxic 10 oxygen ventilation approximately 3 and 6 months after treatment Baseline hemodynamic parameters were comparable in both groups and were unchanged at 6 months in the control group In the papaintreated group at 6 months there were significant reductions in PaO2 95  4 to 79  3 mm Hg p less than 0005 and increases in mean pulmonary artery pressure 12  1 to 18  3 mm Hg p less than 005 and pulmonary vascular resistance 20  03 to 62  21 units p less than 001 Morphometric evaluation demonstrated increased medial thickness in muscular pulmonary arteries less than 50 mu in size Morphologic evaluation confirmed the presence of panlobular emphysema with papain administration We conclude that chronic emphysema produced in dogs by aerosol administration of papain results in elevated pulmonary artery pressure which is characterized pathologically by medial hypertrophy of small pulmonary arteries This model appears suitable for further study of the pathogenesis of pulmonary vascular disease associated with chronic lung disease
S713	The bimodal pattern of Nformylmethionylleucylphenylalanine FMLPactivated luminolenhanced chemiluminescence with distinct early occurring within 1 min extracellular and late intracellular oxidative responses was compared in polymorphonuclear leukocytes PMNL from asymptomatic cigarette smokers and nonsmoking control subjects Relative to control PMNL the PMNL from smokers were hyperreactive to FMLP stimulation with increased generation of both extracellular p less than 0025 and intracellular p less than 0025 reactive oxidants Smokers PMNL also showed increased PMNLactivated superoxide generation and increased apparent receptors for FMLP The watersoluble antioxidants ascorbate and cysteine 25 X 105 M to 25 X 104 M selectively neutralized the extracellular activity of PMNLderived reactive oxidants The lipidsoluble antioxidant dapsone 125 to 30 microgramsml on the other hand inhibited both the extracellular and intracellular FMLPactivated chemiluminescence responses in PMNL from smokers and nonsmoking control subjects Regulation of the increased extracellular and intracellular membraneassociated oxidative responses in PMNL from cigarette smokers is probably an important function of watersoluble and lipidsoluble antioxidants in vivo
S714	Women at two family practice clinics were given questionnaires to determine the nature severity and treatment of symptoms experienced premenstrually the degree to which symptoms affected activities of daily living the relationship of selected variables to womens perception of their symptoms and the degree of physician involvement in discussion andor treatment of symptoms From the study group of 219 women 76 reported symptoms severe enough to interfere with daily activities every month The activity most affected by symptoms was relationship with family and friends while work activities were affected least Womens perception of the degree to which their mothers activities had been affected by premenstrual symptoms was significantly related to their own incapacitation by them Fiftyeight percent of women experiencing symptoms took medication for their symptoms with overthecounter medication being the most frequent treatment Only 14 of the total sample had discussed these symptoms with their physician Sixtynine percent of the sample believed they had premenstrual syndrome PMS There was a significant relationship between womens belief that they had PMS and the degree of incapacitation experienced from their symptoms
S715	Previous studies have identified the effects of Vibrio cholerae and its enterotoxin choleragen CT AB on the myoelectric activity of rabbit ileal loops in vivo The response was defined as the migrating action potential complex the single ring contraction that propels luminal contents aborad In this study the same rabbit model is used to assess whether migrating action potential complex activity or fluid output is induced by recombinant strains of V cholerae that produce no subunit of cholera toxin CT AB or only by the inactive binding subunit CT AB Three live strains were studied El Tor wildtype N16961 CT AB and recombinant strains CVD106 CT AB and JBK70 CT AB Controls received sterile culture broth Migrating action potential complex frequency in animals inoculated with CT AB was significantly increased compared with that in all other experimental groups P less than 001 Fluid output was also increased in animals inoculated with CT AB compared with fluid output in all other groups P less than 005 Migrating action potential complex frequency and fluid output in rabbits given CT AB or CT AB did not differ from activity in controls How these recombinant strains induce diarrhea is unknown but the mechanism may involve bacterial colonization or production of an unknown toxin
S716	The purpose of this prospective and randomized study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of prophylactic transcervical amnioinfusion in the management of labor complicated by meconium A preexisting intrauterine pressure catheter was used for amnioinfusion The incidence of thick meconium was significantly lower after amnioinfusion compared with standard management 5 versus 62 p less than 00005 This was also demonstrated with spectrophotometry Significant differences between the amnioinfusion group and the control group were found for the following arterial cord pH less than 720 16 versus 38 p less than 005 meconium more than trace below the vocal cords at delivery 0 versus 29 p less than 005 and need for positive pressure ventilation at birth 16 versus 48 p less than 005 No complications related to amnioinfusion were observed We conclude that 1 transcervical amnioinfusion during labor complicated by meconium is a simple and apparently safe procedure and that 2 amnioinfusion effectively decreases the frequency of thick meconium the frequency of neonatal acidemia the frequency of more than trace meconium below the vocal cords and the need for positive pressure ventilation
S717	The efficiency of a continuous infusion of insulin in improving glucose tolerance was compared in two groups of very lowbirth weight infants mean  SEM birth weights 757  40 vs 828  80 g and gestational ages 276  07 vs 272  05 weeks receiving total parenteral nutrition with and without the addition of lipid emulsion to the nutrition regimen The mean  SEM cumulative doses of insulin 087  01 vs 115  03 Ukg and hours required to decrease the blood glucose level to 120 mgdL 91  08 vs 95  10 hours were similar Insulin was delivered with a syringe pump used for other routine purposes in the neonatal intensive care unit Continuous intravenous insulin infusion is an effective inexpensive safe method for maintaining glucose homeostasis in lowbirth weight infants who develop hyperglycemia as a consequence of total parenteral nutrition
S718	The frequency and aetiology of aortic valve and mitral annular calcification was studied by echocardiography in 87 patients aged 3570 on maintenance haemodialysis for a mean of 75 years range 0519 Aortic valve calcification AVC was found in 24 patients 28 and mitral annular calcification MAC was found in 31 36 AVC was severe and produced aortic stenosis in 5 patients with a tricuspid aortic valve mean age 516 years which confirms that calcific aortic stenosis is a complication of chronic uraemia MAC was associated with functional mitral stenosis in 1 patient Premature AVC and MAC were associated with an increased calcium X phosphate product and longterm haemodialysis There were no significant differences between those patients with aortic stenosis and those with AVC but no stenosis Patients with AVC had an increased incidence of MAC and vascular calcification Premature AVC and MAC is frequent in dialysis patients and appears to be related to abnormal calcium and phosphate metabolism and to increased mechanical stress on the valve cusps In a small but important group of patients on longterm dialysis premature valve calcification is severe and produces aortic stenosis or less frequently mitral stenosis
S719	After an appropriate clinical and laboratory assessment of a patients fertility status the clinician must often decide whether specific and empiric treatment is indicated Specific treatment may take the form of replacement therapy exogenous gonadotropins or GnRH for pituitary or hypothalamic failure inhibition of prolactin secretion antimicrobial therapy or immunosuppressive therapy for demonstrable immunologic infertility Finally ejaculatory dysfunction often requires sympathomimetic agents Alternatively in the normogonadotropic oligospermic patient the major form of empiric therapy relies on the enhancement of physiologic hormone levels that influence spermatogenesis Such stimulation therapy may be achieved by GnRH analogues antiestrogens exogenous gonadotropins or androgens
S720	Fetal red cells are well suited for intrauterine life however little is known about their response to postnatal environments The purpose of this work was to investigate the metabolic and membrane changes affecting newborn red cells during their exposure to storage in citratephosphatedextrose CPD and citratephosphatedextroseadenine CPDA1 The findings suggest that newborn red cells are affected more by storage than are adult cells These accelerated storage changes in the red cells of newborns may be related indirectly to the rapid adenosine triphosphate ATP decline As is the case with adult red cells fetal cells withstand storage in CPDA1 better than in CPD The storage lesion in these cells was partly reversible as in adult cells by incubation with adenosine It was therefore concluded that newborn red cells obtained from placentas and stored for several weeks in CPD or CPDA1 media or other media that improve the metabolic profile of these cells may be acceptable for transfusion
S721	Sexual dysfunction after a myocardial infarction is a common problem said to occur in 50 to 75 of all patients Sexual dysfunction often antedates the myocardial event The advice given by current textbooks is too often based on anecdotal reports that lack scientific accuracy Studies of the cardiovascular response during sexual intercourse are few but those that exist consistently show that there are wide individual variations in heart rate blood pressure and oxygen consumption Recent reports have also identified potentially dangerous arrhythmias during intercourse Patients who reach 5 to 6 metabolic equivalents METS on stresstesting without ischemia or arrhythmias can in all likelihood resume their normal sexual activities without any risk All other cases have to be considered individually according to the current physiologic knowledge
S722	Lipolytic activity was measured in human plasma without prior administration of intravenous heparin Eluted from heparinSepharose in a barbital buffer containing 6 mgml heparin plasma lipolytic activities in 20 subjects were distributed between hepatic triglyceride lipase HTGL mean  SE 606  46 and extrahepatic lipoprotein lipase LPL 394  46 Confirmation of the identities of HTGL and LPL was provided by inhibitory antisera Preheparin LPL activity was absent in plasma from a patient with type I hyperlipoproteinemia Both preheparin HTGL and LPL activities correlated with the respective activities measured in plasma obtained 15 min after intravenous injection of heparin rs   774 and  685 respectively n  12 Evidence for the metabolic regulation of preheparin lipases was provided by measurement of significant increases in LPL and HTGL activities after oral glucose ingestion Overall preheparin plasma HTGL and LPL activities may reflect ongoing lipoprotein lipolytic activity in tissue beds and because these measurements do not require the administration of intravenous heparin they should prove useful for additional studies of shortterm regulation of the lipases
S723	This study examined the effect of exercise intensity and duration on the percent blood lymphocytes in men of low LF maximal O2 uptake VO2max less than 50 mlkg1min1 and sedentary moderate MF VO2max  5060 mlkg1min1 and recreationally active and high HF VO2max greater than 60 mlkg1min1 and recent training history fitness Thirty healthy adult men aged 2031 yr participated in four randomly ordered cycle ergometer rides ride 1 65 VO2max 30 min ride 2 30 VO2max 60 min ride 3 75 VO2max 60 min and ride 4 65 VO2max 120 min Blood samples were drawn at various times before and after the exercise sessions Lymphocyte subsets were determined by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies for total T CD3 Thelper CD4 and Tsuppressor CD8 lymphocytes and for a subset of cells expressing a natural killer NK cell antigen Leu7 Plasma catecholamines were assayed to determine exercise stress There were sharp reductions P less than 001 in the percentage of panT and Thelper lymphocytes immediately after exercise across all fitness levels the magnitude of this reduction was greatest after the highest intensity ride 3 or longest duration ride 4 work In contrast the absolute number of T and Thelper cells tended to increase after exercise and significantly so in the HF subjects P less than 0005 There was no significant effect of exercise or subject fitness category on the percentage of Tsuppressor lymphocytes although the absolute numbers of this subset increased significantly after exercise in LF subjects Marked increases P less than 001 in the percentage of NK cells occurred immediately after exercise at all intensities and durations tested numerical increases in total NK cells were significant in all fitness groups after the highest intensity work ride 3 P less than 0005 Irrespective of whether the changes were expressed as percentage or total numbers recovery to base line occurred at 30 min after exercise The results suggest that the exercise effect on blood lymphocyte subset percentages in men is transient and occurs across all fitness levels Concomitant changes in plasma catecholamine concentrations are only weakly associated with these lymphocyte subset percentage responses to exercise Furthermore this study shows that the exerciseinduced changes in lymphocyte percentages do not consistently reflect changes in the absolute numbers of cells
S724	Diagnosing BernardSoulier syndrome BSS a congenital hemorrhagic disorder of blood platelets is complicated by the difficulty of separating the giant platelets from other blood cells to allow studies of platelet function and structure We report on the use of three whole blood assays for diagnosing BSS Whole blood platelet aggregation responses studied with an electrical impedance aggregometer were equivalent to those more laboriously obtained by using plateletrich plasma prepared by unit gravity sedimentation and studied with an optical light transmittance aggregometer Platelet aggregation responses were normal with adenosine diphosphate or collagen stimulation but absent with ristocetin or bovine plasma stimulation Whole blood radioimmunoassay of platelet glycoprotein GP expression was performed by using iodinated murine monoclonal antibodies HP11D antiGP IIbIIIa and 6D1 antiGP Ib After incubation with citrated whole blood centrifugation was used to separate cellbound antibody that was quantitated with a gamma counter The patients whole blood had a normal level of cellbound GP IIbIIIa but a substantially reduced level of cellbound GP Ib 5 of normal mean Whole blood smear immunocytochemical staining with monoclonal antibodies and qualitative analysis by light microscopy revealed a considerable reduction of GP Ib expression by the patients giant platelets whereas GP IIbIIIa expression was normal These data helped establish the diagnosis of BSS We conclude that these three relatively simple assays of platelets in whole blood should be of particular value in the clinical laboratory differential diagnosis of patients with congenital thrombocytopenias and giant platelet syndromes
S725	The art gene product of the human immunodeficiency virus is required for the expression of virion capsid and envelope gene proteins The experiments presented here show that sequences located within the coding region of the envelope gene exert a negative effect on the expression of heterologous genes and that the negative effect of these sequences can be relieved by the art gene product This region in the env gene contains negative regulatory sequences that inhibit gene expression as well as a sequence necessary for the art gene productdependent relief of repression The experiments define the cis and transacting components of a regulatory system that permits differential expression of human immunodeficiency virus virion structural and regulatory proteins
S726	The consequences of transfusional iron overload on left ventricular diastolic filling have never been investigated systematically in patients with thalassemia major In the present study the pattern of left ventricular filling was assessed by Doppler echocardiography in 32 patients with thalassemia major age 17  5 years who had not experienced symptoms of heart failure and had normal left ventricular systolic function Data were compared with those obtained in 32 agematched and sexmatched normal subjects An abnormal Doppler pattern of left ventricular filling with increased flow velocity at mitral valve opening followed by an abrupt and premature decrease of flow velocity in early diastole was identified in the patients with thalassemia Peak flow velocity in early diastole was increased in patients compared with controls 90  10 vs 81  15 cmsec p less than 001 and rate of deceleration of flow velocity after the early diastolic peak and the ratio between the early and late atrial peaks of flow velocity were also increased 1050  325 vs 762  193 cmsec2 and 27  07 vs 22  05 respectively p less than 0001 whereas flow velocity deceleration time was reduced 97  22 vs 119  19 msec p less than 0001 This Doppler pattern of diastolic filling is usually described as restrictive and reflects a decrease in left ventricular chamber compliance A restrictive pattern of left ventricular filling was also identified in the subgroup of 16 study patients who had undergone optimal iron chelation therapy with deferoxamineABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S727	In six healthy subjects serum concentrations of 5 amino salicylic acid 5ASA and acetyl 5ASA were measured for up to 24 hours and urinary excretion over 48 hours After an intravenous injection of 326 mmol 5ASA serum concentrations fell rapidly with a distribution halflife of 17  2 min and an elimination halflife of 42  5 min After 45 minutes acetyl 5ASA became the dominant compound and after seven hours serum concentrations of both components were almost unrecordable Orally ingested 5ASA in three preparations to ensure its release in the stomach small intestine and ileocaecal region respectively gave lower serum concentrations and urinary excretion than those obtained after an intravenous infusion Bioavailabilities which ranged from 19 for ileocaecal release to 75 for release in the upper gastrointestinal tract were calculated from areas under the serum concentration curves Urinary excretion of 5ASA and its acetyl metabolite over 48 hours was 78 52 55 and 21 respectively of the dose given intravenously and orally for gastric small intestinal and ileocaecal release
S728	In the last few years serum CA 199 has been shown to be a highly sensitive marker of pancreatic adenocarcinoma This study assesses the value of serum CA 199 assay in the postsurgical followup of patients undergoing pancreatic cancer resection In 14 patients with cancer in the head of the pancreas and abnormal preoperative serum CA 199 values greater than 40 Uml a pancreatoduodenectomy was performed In all patients the CA 199 antigen was immunohistochemically demonstrated on the removed tumoral tissue Postoperative serum CA 199 concentrations were serially measured 15 days after surgery and then every other month Serum CA 199 scores returned to the normal range only in 7 50 of the resected patients All patients with a normal postoperative value and none of those with a persistently elevated one survived longer than 7 months Early postoperative serum CA 199 assay was superior to perioperative staging of the tumor as a prognostic index All of the seven patients with postoperative normal values exhibited a subsequent increase within 16 months In all cases the elevation of CA 199 occurred at least 2 months before ultrasound US could detect local recurrences of hepatic metastasis Our data indicate that a normal early postoperative CA 199 score is a relatively favourable prognostic index in patients who undergo radical surgery for pancreatic cancer and that the CA 199 test can be used as an early marker of recurrence in monitoring these patients
S729	We remodeled and tested our semisoft 20cc ventricle and made a new bileaflet flap inflow valve Housings bases outflow valve and a newly designed diaphragm were all made by vacuum forming and put together by radiofrequency welding or glue In vitro the ventricle produced a cardiac output of 25 to 30 Lmin and showed reliable durability results Hematological testing showed no important thrombogenicity of the new valve Cardiac output was higher than expected for the volume of the ventricle perhaps because of stretching or flow through Animal experiments with the left ventricular assist device LVAD version was done at Ohio State University Earlier in Utah we did 20 cc total artificial heart TAH implantations and LVAD experiments in lambs and recently in calves with the 60cc TAH version A soft ventricle is easy to implant and low in production costs
S730	Streptococcus bovis septicemia is a relatively uncommon entity that is associated with an increased incidence of colonic neoplasms Three of four patients with S bovis endocarditis subsequent to septicemia underwent colonoscopy The fourth patient underwent a barium enema and a proctoscopic examination Polyps were found in three patients and adenocarcinoma of the colon in one Patients with S bovis endocarditis should be considered at high risk for colonic neoplasms Screening colonoscopy is recommended for these patients and followup colonoscopy may be warranted
S731	Listeria monocytogenes is an intracellular parasite that can readily infect the macrophagelike cell line J774 and the kidney epithelial cell PtK2 After being ingested the organism escapes from the phagolysosome into the hostcell cytoplasm N7Nitrobenz2oxa13diazol4ylphallacidin a specific stain for actin filaments Factin demonstrates that within 1 hr of initiation of infection the bacteria become surrounded by hostcell cytoplasmic actin filaments By 3 hr long projections of Factin begin to form at one end of the bacteria These actin structures colocalize with the actinbundling protein alphaactinin as well as with tropomyosin Microinjection of fluorescently labeled alphaactinin in living cells demonstrates that the formation of these Factin projections is associated with bacterial movement actin filaments rapidly assembling behind the bacteria as they migrate through the cytoplasm These Factin tails attain lengths up to 40 microns The movement of the bacteria through the cytoplasm is rapid 012146 micronssec Within 2 min of cytochalasin D 05 microgramsml treatment all bacterial intracellular movement stops and additional bacteriaassociated actin assembly is blocked A nonmotile Listeria mutant induces comparable actin assembly and moves at speeds similar to the wild type indicating that the forces required for intracellular bacterial movement are generated by the host cell L monocytogenes can dramatically stimulate hostcell actin assembly in a directional manner which serves to rapidly propel the bacteria through the cytoplasm allowing the organisms to move to peripheral membranes and spread to uninfected cells
S732	Total glandular mastectomy and modified radical mastectomy were compared for the amount of breast tissue remaining after surgery Multiple biopsies were taken from the anterior chest walls of women following total glandular mastectomy N  27 and modified radical mastectomy N  28 to try to detect any residual glandular tissue Regardless of procedure performed breast tissue was identified histologically in 5 percent of all biopsy specimens 159 and 161 respectively One of every five operative fields was shown to have glandular elements in at least one of the biopsy sites the positive biopsies did not form a discernible pattern The residual breast tissue in each of these patients averaged less than 1 gm On the basis of this study modified radical mastectomy and total glandular mastectomy appear to be equally effective in removing most of the breast
S733	Combined intracellular and microfluorometric recording techniques were used to evaluate whether the inhibition by cholinergic or adrenergic transmitters of the Ca2activated potassium current IAHP in hippocampal CA3 pyramidal cells was mediated by an alteration of depolarizationinduced change in cytosolic free Ca2 concentration Ca2i Low concentrations of isoproterenol 110 microM and muscarine 0251 microM reversibly abolished IAHP without affecting concomitant Ca2 transients or the steadystate Ca2i Only after application of higher concentrations of muscarine Ca2i increased in the presence of potassium channel blockers muscarine depressed Ca2 currents and concomitant Ca2 transients These observations provide direct evidence that the inhibition of IAHP by isoproterenol and muscarine are not mediated by an alteration of Ca2 dynamics
S734	Plasma levels of growth hormone GH and the effect of GH treatment have been evaluated in adult nongrowing sarcomabearing mice C57BL6J Prepubertal tumorbearing mice tumorbearing hypophysectomized SpragueDawley rats and malnourished nontumorbearing animals served as additional groups of study and control animals Adult sarcomabearing mice showed an increase in plasma levels of GH early following tumor implantation GH levels increased further with tumor progression The anorexia and the state of malnutrition in sarcomabearing mice were the major factors behind increased GH levels Muscle wasting and body composition in the tumorbearing host were not improved by GH treatment at doses that increased growth rate in normal growing mice with intact pituitaries or partially normalized growth rate in hypophysectomized rats Exogenous GH supported tumor growth and host body growth to the same extent in hypophysectomized rats Exogenous GH in excess of endogenous GH did not stimulate tumor growth further It is suggested that increased GH production in a tumorbearing host acts in concert with other hormones to stimulate endogenous substrate mobilization and in tumorbearing animals to prevent substrate deficiency and hypoglycemia On the basis of this conclusion it is unlikely that GH supplementation to a freely eating tumorbearing host will support replenishment of host tissues
S735	Previous studies show that cytotoxic activated macrophages cause a reproducible pattern of metabolic inhibition in viable tumor target cells This includes inhibition of DNA synthesis two oxidoreductases of the mitochondrial electron transport chain NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase and succinate ubiquinone oxidoreductase and the citric acid cycle enzyme aconitase This pattern of metabolic inhibition is induced by a cytotoxic activated macrophage associated biochemical pathway with Larginine deimination activity that synthesizes Lcitrulline from Larginine and oxygenated nitrogen derivatives from the imino nitrogen removed from the guanido group of Larginine Here we report that macrophages activated in vivo by infection with bacillus CalmetteGuerin or in vitro by murine rIFNgamma or murine IFNalphabeta in the presence of the second signal LPS in all cases develop inhibition of aconitase and the same two oxidoreductases of the mitochondrial electron transport chain as was documented earlier in target cells of cytotoxic activated macrophages In addition this pattern of metabolic inhibition which develops in cytotoxic activated macrophages is caused by the Largininedependent effector mechanism Inhibition of mitochondrial respiration by effectors of the Largininedependent cytotoxicity system results in a compensatory increase in activity of the glycolytic pathway We speculate that the pattern of metabolic inhibition induced in cytotoxic activated macrophages by the Largininedependent effector system causes changes in the macrophage intracellular environment that increases resistance to certain facultative and obligate intracellular pathogens
S736	Wilms tumor is uncommon in adults and spontaneous retroperitoneal hemorrhage as the presenting sign of renal malignancy also is rare A 22yearold man with spontaneous rupture of a Wilms tumor who died within 5 months is described The factors that probably contributed to his rapid demise included preoperative tumor spilling unfavorable histology and the omission of radiotherapy owing to poor patient compliance Although Wilms tumor is known to have a poorer prognosis in adults than in children the reason for this is not known Due to the limited number of cases reported the optimal treatment for adult Wilms tumor remains to be defined However the recent literature indicates that radical surgery combined with maximal radiotherapy dosage and modification of the chemotherapy schedules used in children may be required to improve the prognosis for adults with Wilms tumor
S737	Detrusor bladder neck dyssynergia DBND is a well recognised cause of bladder outflow obstruction especially in the younger man The cause is unknown and the aim of this study was to determine if any neurological dysfunction is associated with this condition Twentyfive males with proven DBND had sacral reflex latency studies performed The conduction latencies indicate that the underlying cause is unrelated to any demonstrable neuropathy Sacral reflex latencies are not helpful in the investigation of DBND
S738	Sixtyeight cutaneous squamous cell neoplasms in situ and invasive and 26 basal cell carcinomas from 89 patients were analyzed for DNA sequences homologous to the human papillomavirus HPV types found predominantly in the genital tract Thirtysix 53 of the squamous cell neoplasms contained HPV DNA as detected by filter or in situ hybridization analysis The frequency of detection of HPV DNA was dependent on the site of the lesion Of 40 genital squamous cell neoplasms penile vulvar and perianal 27 68 had detectable HPV DNA In 25 of these the HPV type was 16 or HPV16related which was similar to the results for the squamous cell neoplasms of the finger HPV DNA in 9 of 11 tumors with HPV16 in seven None of 16 squamous cell neoplasms from sites other than the genital tract or the finger had detectable HPV DNA HPV DNA was detected in one of the 26 basal cell carcinomas 4 We conclude that for cutaneous epithelial malignancies HPV16 is restricted to squamous cell neoplasms of the genital tract and finger These data are consistent with venereal transmission of HPV16 to the periungual region and suggests a role for this virus in the evolution of squamous cell carcinoma at this site
S739	Among 32 patients with thymoma treated at the Louisiana State University Medical Center there was one patient with aregenerative anemia attributable to thymoma an incidence of 33 Despite successful surgical removal of the thymoma there was only slight improvement of the hematologic status three years after thymectomy The result in this patient approximates the general experience with hematologic remission being likely in less than 20 of cases Experience casts doubt on whether treatment with adrenocortical steroids mediastinal irradiation or splenectomy provides significant beneficial effects
S740	In a prospective study we assessed the causes of mechanical failure in a series of 230 intertrochanteric femoral fractures which had been internally fixed with either a sliding hip screw or a Kuntscher Ynail The overall rate of mechanical failure was 165 cuttingout of the implant from the femoral head was the cause in threequarters of the instances Implants placed posteriorly in the femoral head cut out more often 27 than those placed centrally 7 The cutout rate was also determined by the quality of the fracture reduction but age walking ability and bone density assessed by the Singh grade and metacarpal indices had no significant influence We conclude that these fractures should be reduced as accurately as possible and it is imperative that the implant is placed centrally within the femoral head
S741	The concentration of serum cotinine the major metabolite of nicotine was measured in sera from 4211 women at between 15 and 21 weeks gestation to determine whether a serum cotinine level was a better predictor of low birthweight than the selfreported number of cigarettes smoked per day Both cotinine levels and smoking history were significantly associated with reduced birthweight but cotinine correlated significantly better Smokers of greater than or equal to 25 cigarettes per day representing the 27 of women with the greatest cigarette consumption had infants 289 g lighter than the 68 of women who were nonsmokers Women with serum cotinine levels in the top 27 greater than or equal to 284 ngml had infants 441 g lighter than the 68 of women with the lowest cotinine levels less than or equal to 24 ngml Our results strengthen the evidence linking smoking with low birthweight and also demonstrate that cotinine can be satisfactorily used to assess and monitor cigarette smoking in pregnancy
S742	Actin is an adenine nucleotidebinding protein and an ATPase The bound adenine nucleotide stabilizes the protein against denaturation and the ATPase activity although not required for actin polymerization affects the kinetics of this assembly Here we provide evidence for another effect of adenine nucleotides We find that actin filaments made from ATPcontaining monomers the ATPase activity of which hydrolyses ATP to ADP following polymerization are stiff rods whereas filaments prepared from ADPmonomers are flexible ATP exchanges with ADP in such filaments and stiffens them Because both kinds of actin filaments contain mainly ADP we suggest the alignment of actin monomers in filaments that have bound and hydrolysed ATP traps them conformationally and stores elastic energy This energy would be available for release by actinbinding proteins that transduce force or sever actin filaments These data support earlier proposals that actin is not merely a passive cable but has an active mechanochemical role in cell function
S743	We report a case of bowel injury as a result of an isolated gunshot wound to the scrotum Our experience with penetrating scrotal trauma reveals a high rate of associated injuries the most common being trauma to the soft tissue of the thigh Our case emphasizes the importance of a thorough preoperative and operative evaluation of patients with penetrating scrotal trauma
S744	Interleukin 6 IL6 probably plays a central role in the acute phase response and in haemopoiesis and may be involved in the control of bone turnover We have studied the release of IL6 from human trabecular bone cells treated with a variety of stimuli using a specific bioassay In serum free medium unstimulated human osteoblastlike cells produced IL6 in the range of 10002050 pgml24 h Recombinant human interleukin 1 IL1 alpha 10131011 M tumor necrosis factor alpha TNF alpha 109107 M and lipopolysaccharide 5500 ngml all stimulated release of IL6 from human bone cells Maximal levels of 17000 pgml were observed using the highest concentration of IL1 125OH2D3 and PTH did not stimulate IL6 release Using a specific sheep antihuman IL6 antibody all IL6 activity could be neutralized In parallel studies ROS 1728 rat osteosarcoma cells released around 50 pgml of IL6 under basal conditions which were increased to a maximum of 900 pgml by treatment with PTH 109 M The cytokines were less effective and 125OH2D3 again had no effect Modulation of expression of IL6 mRNA in human osteoblast cells was examined using a human complementary deoxyribonucleic acid probe The mRNA was constitutively expressed and IL1 1011 M and TNF 107 M induced further mRNA expression within 2 h which was sustained over 24 h 125OH2D3 107 M IL6 2000 pgml and PTH 109 M exerted no effects at any time point Dexamethasone 106 M suppressed both basal and IL1 and TNFinduced IL6 mRNA expression IL6 receptor mRNA was constitutively expressed but was not regulated by any of the above agents It is clear that rodent and human osteoblasts differ in their production of IL6 and its modulation These data support the hypothesis that IL6 is produced locally in human bone by osteoblasts under the direction of other cytokines This could have implications in bone remodeling haemopoiesis and systemic responses to local injury
S745	An experimental model has been developed to measure the effect of retrobulbar hematomas on functional vision in cynomolgus monkeys In this model functional vision was quantitated using flashed evoked visual potentials in five monkeys following creation of retrobulbar hematomas In one monkey used as a control functional vision remained impaired for 180 minutes following induction of retinal ischemia by increased intraorbital pressure In two monkeys in which increased intraorbital pressure was relieved by anterior chamber paracentesis following 15 minutes of retinal ischemia flashed evoked visual potential promptly returned to baseline level In two additional monkeys in which increased intraorbital pressure was relieved following 30 minutes of retinal ischemia flashed evoked visual potentials improved but never returned to baseline levels This study demonstrates the usefulness of flashed evoked visual potentials in measuring functional vision in cynomolgus monkeys This experimental model should prove useful in evaluating the effects of increased intraorbital pressure on functional vision and the effect of intervention on impaired vision due to retrobulbar hematomas Further studies with larger numbers of animals are needed to clarify these preliminary studies and document longerterm effects of retinal ischemia secondary to retrobulbar hematomas
S746	The safety of tricyclic antidepressants in cardiac transplant recipients has not been established The author used nortriptyline to treat major depressive episodes in eight cardiac transplant recipients Nortriptyline therapy was associated with increased QRS interval and heart rate but did not significantly affect other hemodynamic or ECG variables or cyclosporine dose requirements It appears that nortriptyline may be used safely in depressed cardiac transplant patients
S747	For 3 months a 37yearold man developed memory loss and personality changes followed by fever seizures bilateral upper motor neuron signs and increased CSF protein with skin induration that was compatible with scleromyxedema An IgGtype paraproteinemia was identified He improved with plasmapheresis but died in acute respiratory and renal failure Autopsy revealed right temporal demyelination and meningeal inflammation
S748	We compared by scanning electron microscopy the structural preservation of the endothelium of three groups of human corneas after 14 days of refrigerated storage in media with one eye in KSol and the fellow eye in CSM Each group used a different production lot of CSM and KSol Group 1 comprised ten corneal pairs and groups 2 and 3 each comprised six corneal pairs In group 1 KSol provided better preservation for each of the ten corneal pairs but CSM was equal or possibly superior to KSol in groups 2 and 3 Variation between different lots from the same manufacturer probably explains the results which emphasizes the need for consistency in the composition of these preservative media Large areas of endothelial cell disruption were found in the periphery of the majority of the corneas Seven of the 44 corneas had no viable endothelial cells As storage times increase methods are needed to detect corneas that are not well preserved We found no consistent differences in the efficacy of corneal preservation between CSM and KSol
S749	The neurofibromatoses are two distinct entities with different genetic origins The phenotypic expressions and required treatments are different The devastating nature of neurofibromatosis2 may be more effectively controlled through the application of advanced imaging techniques and contemporary neurotologic procedures The most common manifestation of neurofibromatosis2 is that of bilateral acoustic neuromas The eventual total bilateral sensorineural deafness associated with this condition can be obviated in selected cases if the diagnosis is established early Followup data are reported for three patients in whom hearing was preserved in at least one ear When removal with hearing preservation is not possible subtotal tumor removal with decompression of the internal auditory canals may delay progression of hearing loss A new approach to tumors of the pterygomaxillary fossa that have extended to the middle cranial fossa has been successfully applied and is described
S750	Five groups of surgical patients each comprising six individuals received epidural doses of morphine or meperidine and the plasma and CSF kinetics were studied Three groups received epidural doses of morphine 3 mg in 1 or 10 ml or meperidine 30 mg in 1 ml Cerebrospinal fluid CSF and central venous blood opioid concentrations were measured intermittently for 6 h after injection Two groups received epidural doses of morphine 3 mg in 1 ml or meperidine 30 mg in 1 ml and opioid CSF concentrations were determined over a 24h period Morphine appeared rapidly in plasma and maximum plasma concentrations were usually detected 5 min after injection and averaged 33 ngml1 in the 1ml volume group and 40 ngml1 in the 10ml volume group The terminal plasma halflife averaged 91  34 min and 87  27 min respectively mean  SEM Maximal plasma concentrations of meperidine were usually detected 10 or 15 min postinjection and averaged 196  29 ngml1 The terminal plasma halflife averaged 124  26 min Morphine crossed the dura relatively slowly and the absorption halflife across the dura averaged 22 min Maximal CSF concentrations were usually seen 6090 min postinjection In contrast meperidine crossed the dura quickly with an absorption halflife averaging 76  20 min Maximal CSF concentrations were seen 15 or 30 min postinjection Morphine and meperidine concentrations remained several times higher in the CSF than in the plasma The fraction of the opioid dose crossing the dura was calculated to be 36 for morphine and 37 for meperidine There were no significant differences in the kinetics of morphine administered in 1 or in 10 ml when CSF was sampled close to the site of lumbar epidural injection The CSF concentrationtime curves of both drugs decreased biexponentially after the initial rise due to diffusion across the dura The early halflife in CSF averaged 733  115 min for morphine and 713  31 min for meperidine and the late halflife averaged 369  113 min for morphine and 982  449 min for meperidine Dosenormalized morphine and meperidine CSF concentrations after epidural administration showed that meperidine concentrations were down to onefourth the corresponding morphine concentrations from the 2nd to the 15th h after administration which may partly explain the longer duration of analgesia from morphineABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS
S751	Disparity exists in published recommendations for monitoring of vancomycin serum concentrations To evaluate the degree of disparity of practice in Illinois directors of pathology of 202 Illinois hospitals were surveyed to assess their vancomycin monitoring practices Of the 202 surveys mailed 82 were returned for a response rate of 41 percent Most hospitals have 200500 beds 60 percent and are nonteaching institutions 72 percent Two thirds of the hospitals sent vancomycin to an outside laboratory for analysis Timing of postinfusion peak concentrations ranged from 0 minutes following end of infusion to 360 minutes Approximately one half of the institutions reported a peak therapeutic range of 3040 mgL at 30 minutes following end of infusion A great majority of institutions were consistent in recommended trough range with 48 of 55 reporting 510 mgL Although there is some consistency among at least half of the hospitals there is a great deal of variability among the other half in peak monitoring guidelines
S752	The effects of pure philanthotoxin PhTX a component of the venom of the wasp Philanthus triangulum were studied on nicotinic acetylcholine receptors nAChRs of vertebrates and insects so as to compare their sensitivities and the mechanism of action of PhTX Electrophysiological techniques were used on frog muscles and cockroach thoracic ganglia and biochemical techniques were applied to membranes from Torpedo electric organ and honeybee brain PhTX 120 microM inhibited reversibly the indirectly elicited muscle twitch and reduced the endplate current peak amplitude and its decay time constant in a concentrationdependent manner In patch clamp studies PhTX 15 microM when combined with acetylcholine induced a concentrationdependent decrease in frequency of channel openings and in channel open and burst times The cockroach fast coxal depressor neuron was inhibited by PhTX in a time and voltagedependent manner The initial rate of binding of 3Hperhydrohistrionicotoxin to Torpedo nAChR in the presence of carbamylcholine was inhibited competitively by PhTX Binding of alpha125I bungarotoxin to electric organ and honeybee brain membranes was inhibited by PhTX Binding of 3Hacetylcholine to the electric organ receptor was potentiated by low concentrations of PhTX but inhibited by high concentrations PhTX therefore inhibits both vertebrate and insect nAChRs which may be important molecular targets for its toxicity It is suggested that PhTX at high concentration may have some competitive action on nAChR but it acts mainly as a blocker of the ion channel of the nAChR in its open conformation
S753	To determine the effects of the sleepinduced increases in upper airway resistance on ventilatory output we studied five subjects who were habitual snorers but otherwise normal while awake AW and during nonrapideyemovement NREM sleep under the following conditions 1 stage 2 lowresistance sleep LRS 2 stage 34 highresistance sleep HRS snoring 3 with continuous positive airway pressure CPAP 4 CPAP  endtidal CO2 partial pressure PETCO2 mode isocapnic to LRS and 5 CPAP  PETCO2 isocapnic to HRS We measured ventilatory output via pneumotachograph in the nasal mask PETCO2 esophageal pressure inspiratory and expiratory resistance RLI and RLE Changes in PETCO2 were confirmed with PCO2 measurements in arterialized venous blood in all conditions in one subject During wakefulness pulmonary resistance RL remained constant throughout inspiration whereas in stage 2 and especially in stage 34 NREM sleep RL rose markedly throughout inspiration Expired minute ventilation VE decreased by 12 in HRS and PETCO2 increased in LRS 33 Torr and HRS 49 Torr CPAP decreased RLI to AW levels and increased endexpiratory lung volume 025093 liter Tidal volume VT and mean inspiratory flow rate VTTI increased significantly with CPAP Inspiratory time TI shortened and PETCO2 decreased 36 Torr but remained 13 Torr above AW During CPAP RLI equal to AW with PETCO2 returned to the level of LRS VTTI and VE were 83 and 52 higher than during LRS alone Also on CPAP with PETCO2 made equal to HRS VT VTTI and VE were 67 112 and 67 higher than during HRS aloneABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S754	We report on a histologically proved case of polyorchidism This rare condition is most often discovered in young males undergoing inguinal hernia repair In 50 per cent of cases the patients are between fifteen and twentyfive years old In more than 60 per cent of cases polyorchidism is discovered on the left side and 30 per cent are associated with an ipsilateral inguinal hernia In 71 per cent of cases malignant degeneration andor transformation occurs Association with true cryptorchidism is still dubious Management consists of recognition multiple biopsies and surgical excision
S755	Regulation of human immunodeficiency virus HIV gene expression is dependent on specific regulatory regions in the long terminal repeat These regions include the enhancer SP1 TATA and transactivating TAR regions In addition viral regulatory proteins such as tat and rev are important in regulating HIV gene expression The mechanism of tat activation remains the subject of investigation but effects at both transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels seem likely Previous mutagenesis of the tat protein revealed that the amino terminus the cysteinerich domain and the basic domain were all required for complete tat activation Mutants of other viral transacting regulatory proteins including E1A tax and VM65 have been identified that were capable of antagonizing the activity of their corresponding wildtype proteins We wished to determine whether mutants of the tat protein could be identified that exhibited a similar phenotype One mutant delta tat that truncated the basic domain of tat resulted in a transdominant phenotype inhibiting tatinduced gene expression of the HIV long terminal repeat but not other viral promoters This mutant exhibited its maximal phenotype in cotransfection experiments when present in an 8 to 30fold molar excess over the wildtype tat gene Transactivation of the HIV long terminal repeat by delta tat was very defective at the DNA concentrations used in these experiments RNase protection analysis indicated that this mutant decreased tatinduced steadystate mRNA levels of the HIV long terminal repeat Secondsite mutations of the delta tat gene in either the amino terminus or cysteine region eliminated the transdominant phenotype In contrast to tat which was localized predominantly to the nucleolus delta tat was present in both the nucleus and cytoplasm suggesting that it may inhibit tat function by preventing nucleolar localization Transdominant mutants of tat may have a role in potentially inhibiting HIV gene expression
S756	In sheep parturition is associated with maturation of fetal pituitaryadrenal function and with rises in the concentrations of ACTH and cortisol F in fetal plasma We examined the hypothesis that pituitary ACTH output in response to arginine vasopressin AVP and CRF separately and together might change during late pregnancy as a function of fetal age Fetal sheep were chronically catheterized and bolus iv injections of equimolar AVP CRF AVP plus CRF or saline controls were given on days 110115 125130 and 135140 of gestation AVP evoked significant rises in plasma ACTH on days 110115 and 125130 but not on days 135140 After AVP the peak plasma concentrations of ACTH were attained at 510 min and basal preinjection values were reestablished by 3060 min After CRF treatment plasma ACTH rose progressively throughout the 240 min of the study Evidence was obtained in support of an increase in pituitary responsiveness to CRF between days 110115 and 125130 and a decrease in response on days 135140 when basal F concentrations were higher The ACTH response to AVP relative to that to CRF was greatest in the youngest fetuses On days 110115 only CRF and AVP showed a synergistic response in ACTH output especially during the first 30 min after agonist injection Plasma F rose in response to the changes in endogenously released ACTH in a manner consistent with progressive fetal adrenal maturation between days 110140 of pregnancy We conclude that in vivo the ovine fetal pituitary responds separately and synergistically to AVP and CRF on days 110115 of gestation but the relative role of AVP in stimulating ACTH release decreases with progressive gestational age

S758	Data from 30 years of followup of the original Framingham Study cohort of 5070 men and women aged 3062 years who were first examined during the period 19481952 and who were free of cardiovascular disease reveal that blood pressure is a strong and consistent predictor of the development of coronary heart disease stroke transient ischemic attack and congestive heart failure Other factors related to blood pressure like obesity left ventricular hypertrophy as demonstrated on electrocardiograms and heart enlargement as shown by xray radiography made several selective additional independent contributions to risk heart enlargement by xray radiography was the best predictor of congestive heart failure
S759	Since 1972 18 patients suffering from metastatic cancer in the cervical spine were treated with prosthetic replacement surgery The surgery enabled the authors to decompress the spinal cord and the nerve roots and at the same time restore stability in the affected spine Patients suffering from severe pain and spinal cord andor nerve root compression secondary to involvement of a single vertebral body particularly benefited from this surgery The rates of positive recovery were as follows 941 for pain relief 917 for motor recovery and 875 for ambulation The surgical efficacy was maintained until the terminal stage Tumor recurrence took place in five casestwo anterior and three posterior Anterior recurrence caused a marked instability whereas posterior recurrence did not affect stability
S760	In a retrospective study 210 autogenous femorotibial saphenous vein grafts inserted during the 15 years from 1967 to 1982 were followedup for a mean period of 623  57 months Seven patients who had had eight grafts died in hospital The remaining 202 grafts fell into three groups 1 Sixty grafts in patients who received 325 mg of dipyridamole and 10 g of acetylsalicylic acid daily starting on the second postoperative day and continuing for six months 2 One hundred and two grafts in patients on no antithrombotic therapy 3 Forty grafts in patients on warfarin therapy to maintain the prothrombin time prothrombinproconvertin method within the therapeutic range 010 to 020 Medication was continued for six months This group included more highrisk patients than the other two groups The mean ages and the incidence of risk factors did not vary significantly between the groups The patency rates in three groups at five years were 625 440 and 260 and at ten years 485 250 and 215 for the dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid no therapy and warfarin groups respectively The limb salvage rates were 100 96 and 85 in the dipyridamole and acetylsalicylic acid no therapy and warfarin groups respectively Thus the best results were seen in the aspirindipyridamole group
S761	Retroviral capsid proteins and replication enzymes are synthesized as polyproteins that are proteolytically processed to the mature products by a virusencoded proteinase We have purified the proteinase of human immunodeficiency virus HIV expressed in Escherichia coli to approximately 90 purity The purified enzyme at a concentration of approximately 20 nM gave rapid efficient and specific cleavage of an in vitro synthesized gag precursor protein Purified HIV proteinase also induced specific cleavage of five decapeptide substrates whose amino acid sequences corresponded to cleavage sites in the HIV polyprotein but not of a peptide corresponding to a cleavage site in another retrovirus Competition experiments with different peptides allowed a ranking of cleavage sites Inhibition studies indicated that the HIV proteinase was inhibited by pepstatin A with an IC50 of 07 microM
S762	Visual disturbance after marked andor recurrent blood loss has been known for at least 25 centuries since Hippocrates however so far its clinical features have been controversial and its pathogenesis enigmatic The author studied seven patients four of whom were seen soon after the visual loss and followed prospectively A detailed review of the extensive literature and analysis of the cases provide relevant information on the subject The blood loss is usually from the gastrointestinal GI tract less often from other sites There is typically a time lag between the bleeding and the onset of visual lossusually up to 10 days less often even 2 to 3 weeks The ocular findings are typically those of anterior ischemic optic neuropathy AION and are usually bilateral Considerable evidence has accumulated that blood loss with or without arterial hypotension causes increase in release of renin and endogenous vasoconstrictor agents eg angiotensin epinephrine and vasopressin because of activation of the sympathoadrenergic system and vasomotor center Our experimental studies on renovascular malignant hypertension indicate that endogenous vasoconstrictor agents produce choroidal ischemia and AION In view of all the evidence it is postulated that in the production of AION after blood loss release of endogenous vasoconstrictor agents is probably a very important factor with arterial hypotension an additional factor increased platelet aggregation may also play a role
S763	The femoral intercondylar notch width was measured in 93 patients with chronic anterior cruciate ligament ACL insufficiency Group 1 in 62 patients with an acute tear of the ACL Group 2 and in 38 fresh anatomic specimen knees Group 3 In six of the specimen knees further anatomic studies of the intercondylar notch were performed after tissue removal The average intercondylar distance was 161 mm in Group 1 181 mm in Group 2 and 204 mm in Group 3 All differences were highly significant The intercondylar notch was wider in the posterior part and had no crossing bony ridges but had generally concave walls which provided a functional shelf for the ACL to insert on the lateral side Significant osteophyte formation and stenosis of the anterior outlet of the intercondylar notch occur early in the ACLdeficient knee A narrow anterior outlet of the intercondylar notch without osteophytes was also found in knees with an acute ACL rupture At reconstruction of the ACL notchplasty should be performed concomitantly
S764	To relate airborne Rat N I concentrations to airway responses in allergic laboratory workers we collected allergen on personal monitors while workers and control subjects were exposed in a rat vivarium for 1 hour Allergen concentrations ranged from less than 15 to 310 ngm3 and were significantly p less than 0001 higher during cage cleaning 19 to 310 ngm3 than during quiet activity less than 15 to 97 ngm3 Among 12 ratallergic volunteers all had a nasal response during the exposure with an increase in nasal lavage histamine concentrations or TAMEesterase activity but only five volunteers had a lower respiratory tract response fall in FEV1 greater than 10 Two of five allergic control subjects had a small change in nasal TAMEesterase activity and none had a 10 fall in FEV1 A dose response was demonstrated between the allergen concentrations and the intensity of the nasal allergic response This occupational challenge procedure thus was able to measure the nasal and lower respiratory tract response to airborne allergen exposure in a work environment It can be used to define further the determinants of this response
S765	Attitudes of faculty and students will influence the success of educational programs to address acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS In 198889 170 medical school faculty and 227 students completed needs assessment questionnaires at the University of Louisville and the results were compared to assess the respondents attitudes about AIDS Both the faculty and the students were found to be fearful of infection had strong negative attitudes toward AIDS patients and had low levels of confidence in the current knowledge about AIDS Both cognitive and affective training strategies are recommended to help learners distinguish unwarranted from warranted fears of infection and to increase their empathy for patients with AIDS
S766	Dimethyl4 4dimethoxy5 6 56dimethylenedioxybiphenyl2 2dicarboxylate DDB is a synthetic analogue of Schizandrin C an active compound isolated from a Chinese herb Fructus schizandrae We administered this compound to dystrophic hamsters in vivo for 31 days This led to a 61 reduction of the calcium content an 86 reduction of the area of calcium deposits and a 52 reduction of the area of necrosis of cardiac muscle However skeletal muscle necrosis was not significantly improved No clear change in plasma creatine kinase CK was observed In an in vitro incubation study the rate of CK release and tetanus tension of the extensor digitorum longus muscle of dystrophic hamsters were not substantially changed by the addition of DDB This study suggests that DDB has some effect on cardiac necrosis and that it might be useful for treatment of the cardiac involvement in patients with muscular dystrophy or other conditions with accompaning Ca accumulation
S767	Using the continuouswave Doppler technique of transcutaneous aortovelography TAV aortic blood velocity was measured in 66 normal individuals at rest and during maximum voluntary supine exercise Stroke distance the systolic velocity integral a measure of stroke volume minute distance a measure of cardiac outputstroke distance times heart rate and peak velocity increased significantly with exercise but flow time shortened slightly Stroke distance was found to rise to a plateau of 24 above the resting value at low work rates during exercise This relatively undemanding noninvasive technique for measuring haemodynamic response to physiological stress may prove valuable in the assessment of left ventricular function Our results in normals are consistent with findings by other techniques and provide a basis for clinical comparisons
S768	Ileal pouchanal anastomosis is a relatively new surgical alternative to conventional ileostomy in patients with chronic ulcerative colitis The rationale for the operation is that the disease is cured by the colectomy proximal proctectomy and distal endorectal mucosal resection but enteric continence is maintained because the anal sphincters are preserved and the reservoir capacity is restored by incorporating an ileal pouch This article describes the criteria for selecting appropriate patients the surgical technique the short and longterm clinical results and the physiologic consequences of the operation The possible implications of this new procedure on the future management of patients with chronic ulcerative colitis are also presented

S770	In 450 cases of structural heart disease diagnosed prenatally 38 fetuses 85 had either a dysplastic or a displaced tricuspid valve The tricuspid valve was dysplastic in 22 fetuses all of which had evidence of tricuspid regurgitation resulting in right atrial dilation and increased cardiothoracic ratio An associated abnormality of the pulmonary valve occurred in 16 fetuses The remaining 16 fetuses had Ebsteins malformation 14 with evidence of tricuspid incompetence at presentation and 10 with an associated abnormality of the pulmonary valve Of the 38 cases the pregnancy was interrupted in 17 spontaneous intrauterine fetal death occurred in 8 11 infants died postnatally and 2 infants are still alive additional abnormalities were found in 8 cases chromosomal anomalies in 2 ventricular septal defects in 2 corrected transposition in 2 the Chiari malformation in 2 supraventricular tachycardia in 1 case and coarctation of the aorta in 1 Fetuses with severe abnormalities are selected for fetal echocardiography by the four chamber screening program and a high rate of natural loss both in intrauterine life and immediately after birth was observed in the 21 cases in which pregnancy was continued This would explain the higher incidence of tricuspid valve disease in our prenatal compared with postnatal series Although increased cardiothoracic ratio and associated lesions of the right ventricular outflow tract contribute to the poor outcome in the cases detected prenatally the absence of these features does not always indicate a good prognosis because progression of disease can occur with advancing gestational age No absolute measurement or single echocardiographic feature emerged as a consistent predictive factor of prognosis
S771	We have found glial fibrillary acidic protein GFAP the major component of astrocyte intermediate filaments to be expressed in cell lines of the RT4 peripheral neurotumor family The RT4 family is a stemcelllike cell line RT4AC that spontaneously undergoes differentiation in culture to three derivative cell types This process termed celltype conversion results in a segregation among the derivative cell types of parental cell phenotypes that have been described as neuronallike or gliallike We have identified a 50kDa GFAPimmunoreactive cytoskeletal protein and GFAP mRNA in continuous RT4AC and RT4D glialtype derivative cell lines but not in two presumptive neuronaltype cell lines This result suggests that GFAP gene expression is coordinately coupled with the expression of other glial properties during celltype conversion In addition the RT4AC and RT4D sublines were found to significantly express GFAP only at high cell densities and not during logarithmic growth and to express GFAP precociously during morphological differentiation following treatment with 1 mM N6 O2dibutyryladenosine 35cyclic monophosphate These observations closely reflect reports of glial filament expression in astrocyte cultures suggesting that a common regulatory mechanism is employed by central and peripheral nervous system glia
S772	The Pediatric Trauma Score has been recommended to triage children with scores of 8 or less to a level 1 pediatric trauma center The Injury Severity Score correlates well with the Pediatric Trauma Score During a 36month period ending December 31 1985 paramedics saw 983 pediatric trauma patients aged 17 years and younger and intervened with advanced life support procedures in 196 20 One hundred fortyfour patients receiving advanced life support were transported to either a level 1 adult trauma center or a pediatric community hospital Our data confirm the correlation between Pediatric Trauma Score and Injury Severity Score and support recommendations to transport patients with Pediatric Trauma Scores of 8 or less to trauma facilities We also conclude that Pediatric Trauma Scores may be useful in predicting hospital resource use
S773	To study the digestion pattern of human highmolecular weight mol wt kininogen HMWK in plasma during contact activation we have prepared monoclonal antibodies MoAbs to the lightchain LC and the heavychain moiety of HMWK One MoAb from each set was purified and neither MoAb inhibited the clotting activity of HMWK In enzymelinked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting experiments neither antibody bound to kininogendeficient plasma Digestion of purified HMWK with plasma kallikrein yielded on reduced sodium dodecyl sulfate gels two LC forms at 62 and 49 kd respectively Digestion of HMWK with tissue kallikrein TK yielded mainly the 62kd form In immunoblot analyses of these digests the antiLC MoAb detected products at 62 and 49 kd respectively With plasma kallikrein the 62kd species slowly shifted to 49 kd and with TK the 62kd species accumulated with time AntiLC MoAb was also used as a probe in immunoblotting experiments to study the digestion pattern of HMWK in whole plasma activated with kaolin or dextran sulfate In activated normal pooled plasma NHP and factor XIdeficient plasma native HMWK mol wt 115 kd was cleaved within five to ten minutes and two LC forms at 62 and 49 kd were detected In kaolinactivated prekallikrein PKdeficient plasma the disappearance of the 115kd form was relatively slow and only the 62kd form of LC was seen HMWK was not cleaved when factor XIIdeficient plasma was incubated with kaolin LCdependent coagulant activity paralleled the presence of LC bands seen in the immunoblots and lowermol wt fragments of LC were not identified These data indicate that in activated NHP two forms of LC of HMWK 62 and 49 kd are formed sequentially Further the LCdependent coagulant activity remains detectable long enough to suggest that proteolytic inactivation of LC is too slow to be an important control mechanism
S774	A technique of permanent dermal micropigmentation using a nonallergenic iron oxide pigment to cover recalcitrant areas of vitiligo is described The areas included in this study were the distal digits the lips hands wrists axillae elbows hairline perioral area and lower legs The immediate postmicropigmentation results invariably showed dramatic aesthetic improvements There was a moderate degree of fading in the majority of cases most of which occurred within the first six weeks The pigment that remained usually persisted with minimal to no further fading Short and longterm complications which were few mild and resolved fully are discussed No allergic reactions to the pigment or koebnerization of the vitiligo have been noted
S775	We tested the hypothesis that liver histology from patients with graftversushost disease could be distinguished from other common liver diseases Liver biopsies from 33 allogeneic marrow transplant recipients with acute and chronic graftversushost disease and 37 nontransplant liver disease patients without graftversushost disease were recut restained and coded for blind review Analysis of individual histologic features showed significantly more cytologic aberration of bile duct epithelium and more cholestasis among biopsies with graftversushost disease when compared to biopsies without graftversushost disease p less than or equal to 005 The duration of graftversushost preceding the biopsy influenced the histologic features Biopsies before Day 35 showed frequent acidophilic bodies but infrequent bile duct changes Biopsies from Days 35 to 90 posttransplant had more frequent bile duct exocytosis and disruption and biopsies from patients with chronic graftversushost disease beyond Day 90 showed more frequent portal fibrosis and bile duct dropout Pattern assessment of coded biopsies showed that a histologic diagnosis of graftversushost disease had a positive predictive value of 86 a sensitivity of 66 and a specificity of 91 Falsenegative diagnoses occurred most frequently in biopsies obtained less than 4 weeks posttransplant usually because bile duct abnormalities were not present Falsepositive diagnoses of graftversushost disease occurred in nongraftversushost disease biopsies with periportal inflammation and proliferated bile ducts However biopsies of chronic graftversushost disease had more frequent dropout and disruption of bile duct epithelium than did biopsies of acute or chronic hepatitisABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S776	A previously introduced method by which prehepatic betacell secretion is calculated in vivo from plasma measurements of insulin and Cpeptide was applied to data derived from iv glucose tolerance tests performed in normal women Prehepatic secretory rates calculated using the combined model appeared biphasic in nature after glucose injection Basal insulin secretion was 639  98 pmolmin The duration of first phase was approximately 5 min with secretion reaching a peak of 2033  342 pmolmin The first phase was followed by a significant refractory period in which the secretory rate fell below basal values The magnitude of second phase secretion was small relative to first phase secretion and appeared pulsatile in nature Total integrated insulin secretion was 222  27 nmol of which first phase accounted for 32 and second phase accounted for the remaining 68 Total incremental integrated secretion was 106  14 nmol accounting for approximately half of the total insulin secretion Proportions of first and second phase secretion changed to 665 and 335 respectively with incremental data This study shows that the combined model of insulin and Cpeptide is capable of estimating prehepatic insulin secretion from the iv glucose tolerance test and may provide a useful tool to measure secretion in vivo under various pathological conditions
S777	Prognosis in aplastic anemia is usually linked to the degree of hypoplasia in the bone marrow and pancytopenia in the blood The authors were therefore intrigued when a patient with methimazoleassociated aplastic anemia who satisfied criteria for severe disease recovered rapidly and completely once her drug was withdrawn Review of the English language literature revealed ten fully documented cases of aplastic anemia associated with use of the antithyroid drugs methimazole carbimazole and propylthiouracil Analysis of the ten and of an eleventh case presented here indicated that the disorder is typically characterized by severe pancytopenia and profound marrow hypoplasia yet surprisingly good prognosis ie minimum survival of more than 70 with partial or complete recovery from symptoms and cytopenias in survivors within 25 weeks The only deaths both in the 1950s were from brain hemorrhage in patients who were not transfused with platelets The discrepancy between the clinical and laboratory severity of antithyroid drugassociated aplasia on the one hand and its relatively good prognosis and short term course on the other should be kept in mind when considering these patients for bone marrow transplantation or for therapy with antithymocyte globulin
S778	Using a monospecific rabbit antibody against Yersinia enterocolitica outer membrane protein 1 we examined synovial biopsy specimens from 7 patients with Yersiniainduced arthritis Yersinia were demonstrated in the synovial membrane by indirect immunofluorescence in 4 patients with Yersiniainduced arthritis but not in 6 control patients with Salmonellainduced arthritis or with rheumatoid arthritis These findings suggest the persistence of Yersinia in the joints of patients with Yersiniainduced arthritis
S779	We have shown that heparin lowers blood pressure significantly in hypertensive rats This study was initiated to examine whether prostaglandin PG mediates the antihypertensive action of heparin To this end the effect of three different PG synthesis inhibitors indomethacin aspirin meclofenamate on the cardiovascular and renal actions of heparin was studied in spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR During 4 weeks of treatment heparin reduced blood pressure significantly P less than 001 in SHR This was accompanied by significant decrements in hematocrit and total peripheral resistance but a significant increment in cardiac output All of the PG inhibitors used significantly potentiated the antihypertensive effect of heparin and further reduced blood pressure by about 20 Although heparin alone increased plasma renin activity heparin and PG inhibitors together prevented this effect When compared with heparintreated rats SHR treated with heparin and PG inhibitors combined had significantly p less than 005 to 001 lower plasma aldosterone levels These levels however were not different from SHR treated with PG inhibitors alone Like blood pressures the renal histopathologic lesions in SHR treated with heparin or heparin and PG inhibitors combined were significantly less severe than those in untreated SHR or SHR treated with PG inhibitors alone Finally captopril was shown to potentiate the effect of heparin In conclusion the antihypertensive effect of heparin does not appear to be PG mediated but may be related to the structural changes in renal arterioles inhibition of angiotensinconverting enzyme or both
S780	Endothelial cells form the luminal vascular surface and thus have a central role in the regulation of coagulation One important way in which endothelial cells control the clotting system is by regulating the expression of binding sites for anticoagulant and procoagulant factors on the cell surface In the quiescent state endothelial cells maintain blood fluidity by promoting the activity of numerous anticoagulant pathways including the protein Cprotein S pathway After activation as can be brought about by cytokines the balance of endothelial properties can be tipped to favor clot formation through coordinated induction of procoagulant and suppression of anticoagulant mechanisms Tumor necrosis factor suppresses the endothelial anticoagulant cofactor thrombomodulin and induces expression of the procoagulant cofactor tissue factor Working in concert these changes can allow fibrin formation to proceed in an inflamed focus but maintain blood fluidity in the surrounding area of normal vasculature Recent studies suggest that similar changes in endothelial coagulant properties can be induced by advanced glycosylation end products proteins modified by glucose that accumulate in the vasculature at a rapid rate in diabetic subjects indicating the potential relevance of these mechanisms in diabetic vascular disease
S781	We have presented a case of pregnancy complicated by diabetes insipidus Treatment with desmopressin acetate DDAVP appropriately managed the DI and was not associated with a worsening of the condition as pregnancy progressed
S782	The conditioned medium of a HTLVIcarrying T cell line HUT102 showed cytotoxic activity against a mouse fibroblast cell line LM We prepared the cDNA library from HUT102 polyA RNA and screened it using oligonucleotide probes that correspond to the amino acid sequences conserved in tumor necrosis factor TNF and lymphotoxin LT As a result we obtained two kinds of cDNA clones encoding LT in which amino acid residue 26t of mature LT is different one is Asn and another is Thr The sequence of the genomic clones obtained using a polymerase chain reaction method showed that the HUT102 genome also contains two types of LT genes Recombinant LTs expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited the same level of cytolytic activity against LM cells These results indicate that the cytotoxin constitutively produced by HUT102 cells include two kinds of LT
S783	Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF and pulmonary fibrosis associated with a collagen vascular disorder PFCVD are chronic inflammatory lung disorders which may be characterized in various subgroups of patients by increased numbers of macrophages neutrophils lymphocytes andor eosinophils Previous studies have suggested that the cell populations recovered with bronchoalveolar lavage BAL may be important in predicting disease progression and response to therapy We evaluated this hypothesis in 27 patients by determining if the cell populations recovered with BAL differed between patients who improved remained stable or worsened in their pulmonary functions as defined by at least a 15 percent change in forced vital capacity over a sixmonth observation period The findings suggested that BAL eosinophilia may be a marker of progressive lung disease in patients with IPF and PFCVD
S784	Spontaneous postanesthetic tremor that resembles shivering is common during recovery from anesthesia Risks to postoperative patients include an increase in metabolic rate of up to 400 hypoxemia wound dehiscence dental damage and disruption of delicate surgical repairs The etiology of spontaneous postanesthetic tremor is most commonly attributed to normal thermoregulatory shivering in response to intraoperative hypothermia However the mechanism of this tremor remains unknown hampering prevention and treatment The present study was designed to determine whether mechanisms other than thermoregulation contribute to the tremor The electromyograms EMGs of eight muscles were observed in nine women during recovery from isoflurane anesthesia Signals from each muscle were compared to those of pathologic clonus induced by plantar flexion in unanesthetized patients with spinal cord transections and to those of coldinduced shivering in normal unanesthetized subjects Two distinct EMG patterns were identified 1 regular bursting signals of 57 Hz similar to those produced by pathologic clonus in patients with spinal cord transections and 2 tonic irregular signals of 515 Hz which had poorly defined bursts that did not demonstrate the synchronous 48cyclemin waxing and waning pattern typical of normal shivering EMG activity occurred most often at expired isoflurane concentrations of 01019 and was not related to rectal temperature During the later part of recovery when isoflurane concentrations were less than or equal to 01 hypothermic patients frequently demonstrated no clinical or EMG evidence of muscular activityABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S785	Severe hypercalcemia a potentially lifethreatening condition has been reported rarely during pregnancy A patient with hypercalcemic crisis associated with excessive ingestion of absorbable calcium antacid was treated successfully with hemodialysis as well as other therapeutic measures such as saline diuresis This acute therapy resulted in longterm normalization of maternal calcium levels The fetus who exhibited a low biophysical score during the initial admission was delivered a month later and had an uncomplicated neonatal course Acute hemodialysis can be an effective rapid and safe method of lowering serum calcium levels in pregnant patients with severe hypercalcemia unresponsive to other medical therapies
S786	The frequency and pathogenesis of nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver NRHL were examined in general autopsy series We found NRHL in 12 cases 21 of 577 consecutive autopsy livers without hepatic necrosis fibrosis cirrhosis or tumors All of these cases were middleaged to elderly adults and there was a slight female predominance of 21 Symptoms related to the liver were absent in all but two cases NRHL was an incidental finding in these 12 cases at autopsy The main other diseases in these cases were classified into four groups a organic cardiac diseases four cases b pulmonary diseases with rightsided cardiac hypertrophy four cases c small arterial diseases involving the liver two cases and d systemic amyloidosis involving intrahepatic small arterial branches two cases The frequency of NRHL in these four groups at autopsy was 38 71 333 and 222 respectively suggesting that while NRHL is rare clinicians should be aware of its association or development of NRHL in several conditions Disturbances of outlet venous blood flow and inlet arterial blood flow may contribute to the development of NRHL in the former two and latter two groups respectively
S787	Prominent crystalline inclusions were noted in the glomeruli of a 57yearold man with a 6month history of swelling and pain in the hands slight proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine and BUN The crystalline inclusions were most prominent in the visceral epithelium but were also noted in endothelial and mesangial cells in the parietal epithelium and in the epithelial cells of the proximal tubules On electron microscopy the crystalline structures were of various geometric shapes but had no definite substructure Immunofluorescence was negative The patient was considered to have a hitherto undescribed metabolic disease Several months later the patient underwent an operation for carpal tunnel syndrome and amyloid deposits crystalline inclusions similar to those noted in the kidney were observed in the synovial tissue Shortly after this the patient was found to have multiple myeloma of IgG kappa type with Bence Jones proteinuria Lymphoplasmacytic cells in the bone marrow contained the same crystalline inclusions noted in the kidney and synovium This case therefore seems to represent a new and very rare form of glomerular involvement in multiple myeloma
S788	The objective of this study was to examine the effect of antihypertensive treatment on the structure of intramyocardial resistance vessels in spontaneously hypertensive rats The rats were divided into four groups one was used as control and the other three were treated from the age of four to 24 weeks with isradipine hydralazine and metoprolol respectively Half of the animals in each group were examined at the end of active treatment and the rest were examined three weeks later The rats were anesthetized and killed during constant flow perfusion with 1 percent glutaraldehyde The media index was determined by point counting The media indices of rats treated with isradipine and hydralazine were significantly smaller than those of agematched spontaneously hypertensive rat controls whereas the media indices of rats in the metoprolol group did not differ significantly Three weeks after treatment withdrawal the media index tended to increase in all three groups but the values for the isradipine and hydralazine groups were still significantly reduced Noninvasive blood pressure measurements taken at the same time demonstrated a significant blood pressure reduction in all groups although differences within each treatment group were evident All pressures had stabilized on the level of spontaneously hypertensive rats three weeks after withdrawal Thus it is evident that both isradipine and hydralazine were able to prevent hypertrophy of intramyocardial vascular structure and continue to do so even after treatment withdrawal This finding is consistent with previous findings suggesting a close relationship between the extent of blood pressure reduction and the degree of prevention of vascular hypertrophy
S789	Preliminary experimental studies in our laboratory have shown that autologous pericardium treated with glutaraldehyde prevents late deterioration and calcification of the tissue For this reason glutaraldehydetreated autologous pericardium has been used in a series of 64 patients who underwent operations for leaflet extension of the mitral valve between 1980 and 1989 Ages ranged from 25 to 60 years mean 19  15 The causes of mitral valve insufficiency were rheumatic fever 69 bacterial endocarditis 17 congenital 8 endomyocardial fibrosis 45 and trauma 15 The autologous tissue was fixed in a 062 glutaraldehyde solution for 15 minutes and rinsed in saline for an additional 15 minutes Patching techniques varied depending on the site and the extent of the lesion Associated mitral valve repair techniques Carpentiers techniques were mandatory in all patients The period of followup extended from 6 months to 9 years mean 31  25 years There were no operative deaths in this series and there was one late death 2 In the six patients 12 who underwent reoperation there has been no case of calcification of the pericardial patch Postoperative mitral valve function was assessed by bidimensional color Doppler echocardiographic techniques Mitral valve insufficiency was trivial or absent in 80 of the patients This experience permits us to conclude that leaflet extension is a simple and safe technique in valve reconstruction allowing repair of mitral valves that otherwise would need to be replaced It permits use of an adultsize prosthetic ring in children Glutaraldehydetreated autologous pericardium is the material of choice for this type of repair
S790	Controversy exists concerning the association of inguinal hernia and colonic carcinoma and more specifically whether the development of an inguinal hernia justifies sigmoidoscopy To study the role of endoscopic screening in cases of inguinal hernia we prospectively evaluated 464 patients with inguinal hernia over a 54month period with flexible sigmoidoscopy Each patient was over the age of 40 and male Sigmoidoscopy documented polyps 97 patients 21 percent and carcinoma 22 patients 5 percent Multiple neoplasms were observed in 6 percent 7 of 119 patients Occult blood was detected in the fecal specimens of 8 percent of the total group of patients but in only 13 percent of the patients with polyps or carcinomas A normal examination occurred in only 38 percent of the total group By using the presence of an inguinal hernia in patients older than 40 years of age as an indication for sigmoidoscopy we found that more than one of every four patients had an asymptomatic concurrent malignant or premalignant colonic lesion Flexible sigmoidoscopy should be used for screening colonic neoplasms in patients with inguinal hernia
S791	The steady state synthesis of L35Smethionineradiolabeled cellular proteins by two rat osteogenic sarcoma cell lines G2 and C12 was examined by twodimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under basal conditions and after 72h treatments with 10 nM 125dihydroxycholecalciferol or triamcinolone acetonide Computer analysis resolved 681 spots with mol wt ranging from 10105K and isoelectric points ranging from 4080 Fourteen spots were abundant greater than or equal to 2000 partsmillion with the remainder occurring in limited abundance 1502000 partsmillion in both clones Only 28 proteins were radiolabeled at significantly different rates by G2 and C12 cells under basal conditions The high degree of similarity in the identity and relative abundance of proteins synthesized by these distinct subclones suggests that minor changes in the levels of specific intracellular proteins may have major effects on the osteoblastic phenotype 125Dihydroxycholecalciferol 125OH2D3 or triamcinolone acetonide treatment induced qualitative and quantitative changes in the synthesis of specific subsets of proteins including induction of novel proteins complete repression of proteins synthesized under basal conditions and significant increases or decreases in the levels of others 125OH2D3 significantly altered the levels of 13 proteins in G2 cells and 28 proteins in C12 cells 125OH2D3 enhanced the synthesis of two proteins no 304 and 2506 in both subclones The remainder of the proteins affected by 125OH2D3 were unique to the subclone With the exception of protein 304 the changes induced by 125OH2D3 differed from those induced by triamcinolone acetonide suggesting that unique proteins modulate the osteoblastic phenotype in response to these steroids
S792	Of 711 patients who were delivered after one or more previous cesarean sections 17 24 had an extremely serious complication Uterine rupture and placenta previa or placenta accreta with accompanying hemorrhage were the major contributors to mortality and major morbidity Nine uterine ruptures occurred including five associated with labor with a low transverse uterine scar and one with an unknown scar 14 of trials of labor There were two cases of placenta previa and five with varying degrees of placenta accreta The nature and frequency of the observed complications emphasize the potentially serious remote consequences of cesarean section
S793	Blastomycosis is a rare systemic fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis which is often difficult to diagnose because of its spectrum of manifestations varying severity and unusual occurrence in most geographic areas Because routine serologic methods and skin tests are not reliable for this pathogen diagnosis is made by visualization of the organism in tissue sputum or exudate or by culture Once blastomycosis is diagnosed therapeutic options include treatment with amphotericin B or ketoconazole or simple observation if spontaneous resolution is anticipated The purpose of this discussion is to review the features of blastomycosis that relate to the clinical practice of medicine
S794	An antibody detection procedure based on agglutination of autologous red cells has been developed for samples of whole blood A nonagglutinating monoclonal antibody to human red blood cells conjugated to a synthetic peptide antigen in this case residues 579 to 601 of the HIV1 envelope precursor ArgIleLeuAlaValGluArgTyrLeuLysAspGlnGlnLeuLeuGlyIleTrp GlyCys  SerGlyLys permitted the detection of antibodies to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV1 in 10 microliters of whole blood within 2 minutes Agglutination was specifically inhibited by addition of synthetic peptide antigen but not by unrelated peptides The frequency of false positive results was 01 with HIV1 seronegative blood donors n  874 The false negative results were approximately 1 n  81 The autologous red cell agglutination test is potentially suitable for simple rapid qualitative screening for antibodies to a variety of antigens of medical and veterinary diagnostic significance
S795	There is evidence from population studies of strong positive associations between smoking arterial pressure and serum cholesterol concentration and risk of ischaemic heart disease and these appear to be independent of one another but the evidence from unifactorial trials of risk factor reduction is less impressive For smoking there is no good experimental evidence that cessation reduces the risk of IHD but there are good observational data to show that those who choose to cease have a lower mortality from IHD and all causes of death compared with those who continue to smoke For arterial pressure none of the randomized controlled trials has shown any benefit from a reduction in arterial pressure in relation to IHD although the same studies have shown that risk of stroke is reduced substantially The best trial evidence for risk factor reduction is seen for serum cholesterol and in all three major placebo control trials reduction was associated with a corresponding decrease in the incidence of IHD for each 1 decrease in serum cholesterol concentration there was a 3 reduction in risk of IHD However total mortality was unchanged and in the case of the WHO CoOperative Study there was a statistically significant excess of deaths in the treatment group The use of drugs in the primary prevention of IHD is a matter of judgement based on the risk of disease the efficacy of the treatment and side effects
S796	The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the emerging discipline of pharmacoeconomics Specific methodologies and terms are defined Pharmacoeconomic research is described related to and contrasted with clinical drug trials Additionally we present a brief overview of the general steps taken designing a pharmacoeconomic study Finally several issues centering around pharmacoeconomic analysis are presented for discussion and debate The need for highquality pharmacoeconomic research is stressed along with the need for appropriate education of individuals trained in the health sciences
S797	Eleven 3 of 340 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma HCC presented with obstructive jaundice The tumor extensively infiltrated the major bile ducts in eight patients Jaundice was relieved by endoscopic endoprosthesis in four patients nasobiliary drainage in two patients percutaneous transhepatic stenting in one patient and surgical intubation in one patient The survival interval of these eight patients mean  SD was 35  20 days Three patients had tumor fragments in the common bile ducts In two patients major hepatic resection was done after initial tube decomposition of the biliary system One patient remained tumorfree on followup at 24 months and the other patient had recurrent tumor detected on followup at 17 months after surgery The tumor was irresectable in the third patient Multiple surgical and endoscopic procedures kept the bile duct patent for 17 months before the patient died of the disease Not all patients who present with obstructive jaundice due to HCC are terminally ill With proper management good palliation and occasional cure are possible
S798	Eight men with isolated hypogonadotropic hypogonadism were treated with pulsatile gonadotropinreleasing hormone GnRH after maximal testicular growth and function had already been achieved with human chorionic gonadotropin hCG and human menopausal gonadotropin hMG Only four subjects could normalize plasma testosterone T levels group A After 18 months of GnRH therapy testicular size of group A increased by 53 P less than 001 over that previously attained with exogenous gonadotropins However despite further testicular growth two men who were previously azoospermic on hCGhMG remained so on GnRH In the other two patients total sperm count increased minimally Thus pulsatile gonadotropin levels achieved with GnRH are more effective in stimulating testicular growth but not necessarily sperm output than are stable gonadotropin concentrations obtained with hCGhMG
S799	We conducted a study to determine the costs of caring for patients with arthritis Data were obtained from the Medicaid Management Information System MMIS of Washington DC A retrospective analysis was undertaken of all direct medical costs related to individual Medicaid recipients who obtained treatment for arthritis First all data were adjusted for patient compliance with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs Second we determined the actual expenditure of treating arthritis Last the medical costs of treating adverse gastrointestinal side effects were examined There was a linear relationship between compliance and pharmaceutical dose schedule per diem Treatment costs per quarter were 145 54 percent of the cost was for NSAIDs with the remainder equally divided between physician and hospital costs Approximately 25 percent of the population experienced NSAIDrelated gastrointestinal side effects that required further medical care The perquarter mean cost of treating these adverse gastrointestinal drug reactions was 66 per person which added nearly 46 percent to the perquarter mean cost of treatment The total cost of treating patients with arthritis therefore averaged 211 per quarter Nearly one third of overall cost went to provide medical care to the 25 percent of the population who experienced adverse reactions and slightly more than two thirds went towards treating the disease itself Overall costs of treating adverse drug reactions were accounted for by pharmaceuticals about 42 percent usually the histamine H2receptor antagonist cimetidine rare but expensive inpatient hospital care about 38 percent and physician visits about 20 percent
S800	Calcium channel blockers inhibit myometrial contractility by preventing the increase in intracellular free calcium which follows stimulation They could thus be useful in treating premature labour The effect of nitrendipine a dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist on the contractile response of strips of pregnant human myometrium to oxytocin angiotensin II AII and ergometrine has been examined A total of 68 tissue strips were studied with random allocation to treatment group Initial concentration response curves to one of the three agonists were determined the concentrationresponse determinations were repeated in the presence or absence of nitrendipine at 109M The initial EC50S for tissues exposed to oxytocin and AII were 82 X 1010M and 34 X 108M respectively The contractile response to both agonists was significantly blunted in the presence of nitrendipine ANOVA P less than 0001 for both agents This effect was greatest at high agonist concentrations The initial EC50S for tissues exposed to ergometrine was 39 X 108M Exposure to nitrendipine blunted the response ANOVA P less than 0001 an effect most marked at low concentrations of ergometrine The effect of nitrendipine on myometrial responses to the naturally occurring hormones oxytocin and AII supports suggestions of a role for it in inhibiting premature labour
S801	Chromaffin cells were isolated from bovine adrenal medullae and maintained in primary culture After prelabeling with 32PO4 exposure of the chromaffin cells to acetylcholine increased the phosphorylation of a Mr approximately equal to 100000 protein and a Mr approximately equal to 60000 protein tyrosine hydroxylase visualized after separation of total cellular proteins in naDodSO4polyacrylamide gels Immunoprecipitation with antibodies to three known phosphoproteins 100kDa 87kDa and protein III revealed an acetylcholinedependent phosphorylation of these proteins These three proteins were also shown to be present in bovine adrenal chromaffin cells by immunolabeling techniques 100kDa is a Mr approximately equal to 100000 protein selectively phosphorylated by calciumcalmodulindependent protein kinase III 87kDa is a Mr approximately equal to 87000 protein selectively phosphorylated by protein kinase C and protein III is a phosphoprotein doublet of Mr approximately equal to 74000 IIIa and Mr approximately equal to 55000 IIIb phosphorylated by cAMPdependent protein kinase and calciumcalmodulindependent protein kinase I Furthermore 100kDa was shown to be identical to the Mr approximately equal to 100000 protein whose phosphorylation was increased by acetylcholine treatment The acetylcholinedependent increase in phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase 100kDa 87kDa and protein III required extracellular calcium and was mimicked by nicotine veratridine elevated K and calcium ionophore A23187 but not by muscarine In addition forskolin increased the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase 100kDa and protein III but not that of 87kDa Phorbol 1213dibutyrate increased the phosphorylation of tyrosine hydroxylase 87kDa and protein III but not that of 100kDa The data demonstrate that cholinergic activation of chromaffin cells increases the phosphorylation of several proteins and that several protein kinase systems may be involved in these effects
S802	A family of cytokine receptors comprising molecules specific for a diverse group of hematopoietic factors and growth hormones has been principally defined by a striking homology of binding domains This work proposes that the approximately 200residue binding segment of the canonical cytokine receptor is composed of two discrete folding domains that share a significant sequence and structural resemblance Analogous motifs are found in tandem approximately 100amino acid domains in the extracellular segments of a receptor family formed by the interferonalphabeta and gamma receptors and tissue factor a membrane tether for a coagulation protease Domains from the receptor supergroup reveal clear evolutionary links to fibronectin type III structures approximately 90amino acid modules that are typically found in cell surface molecules with adhesive functions Predictive structural analysis of the shared receptor and fibronectin domains locates seven betastrands in conserved regions of the chain these strands are modeled to fold into antiparallel betasandwiches with a topology that is similar to immunoglobulin constant domains These findings have strong implications for understanding the evolutionary emergence of an important class of regulatory molecules from primitive adhesive modules In addition the resulting doublebarrel design of the receptors and the spatial clustering of conserved residues suggest a likely binding site for cytokine ligands
S803	OBJECTIVE To determine the effect of lowdose methotrexate in asthmatic patients on steroid use asthma symptom scores pulmonary function airway reactivity blood cellular components and immunoglobulin E levels DESIGN A randomized doubleblind parallel placebocontrolled 13week clinical trial with followup of patients in an open trial of methotrexate at the conclusion of the doubleblind study SETTING An asthma care outpatient clinic PATIENTS From February 1988 to March 1990 19 patients with severe steroiddependent asthma were enrolled in the study Two of these patients were excluded from analysis INTERVENTIONS Patients were administered methotrexate or placebo intramuscularly to assure complete absorption once weekly during the 13week study RESULTS Patients on methotrexate and placebo both significantly decreased their steroid dose by 396 95 CI 251 to 541 P  0001 and 402 CI 179 to 674 P  0003 respectively Pulmonary function did not differ significantly between the methotrexate and placebo groups In addition airway reactivity and symptom scores were unchanged on methotrexate or placebo No significant toxicities were seen during the course of the 13week blinded study but one patient on methotrexate and prednisone in the followup period developed Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia and died Despite continuing methotrexate for up to 1 year and increasing methotrexate to 30 mg weekly no significant benefit of methotrexate on asthma control could be shown CONCLUSION Our study does not support the use of methotrexate in the treatment of severe asthma
S804	In an effort to develop a transcatheter technique for dilatation of the prostatic urethra without the use of balloons the feasibility of using Gianturco selfexpanding stents was evaluated Initially eight human cadaveric prostatic urethras were stented to evaluate the ability of the stent to dilate the lumen In all cases the device attained its unconstrained diameter immediately on placement Subsequently stents were placed in the prostatic urethra of 12 dogs and followed up for 1 month four dogs 3 months one dog and 6 months seven dogs Five bare straightend prostheses one nyloncovered straightend device and six flaredend stents were used Three of the bare straightend stents migrated during the followup whereas the nyloncovered and flaredend stents did not Stent diameters greater than 13 times the urethral diameter caused moderate to marked edema and inflammation After 6 months white deposits were found on the solder points presumably from electrolysis Our experience suggests that placement of Gianturco selfexpanding stents may be a useful method of dilating and maintaining the luminal diameter of the prostatic urethra although care must be taken to select the proper stent size
S805	Thirtyfour patients with stages IE and IIE gastric lymphoma were treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy combinations without stomach resection In 20 patients the diagnosis was established by endoscopic biopsy only the other 14 had laparotomy and biopsy No patient had a gastrectomy before treatment Nineteen patients had stage IE disease and 15 had stage IIE Lymphoma diagnoses were diffuse largecell 26 immunoblastic three diffuse welldifferentiated three nodular mixed one and unclassified one The treatment plan was to deliver an initial four cycles of chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy and finally more chemotherapy Thirtythree patients received cyclophosphamide doxorubicin vincristine prednisone and bleomycin CHOPBleo Four patients with stage IIE disease received cyclophosphamide methotrexate etoposide and dexamethasone CMED Twentythree patients 68 never had a relapse Three patients had successful salvage therapy one for local recurrence and two for tumor dissemination Five patients died of recurrent abdominal disease and one died of tumor dissemination Two died of treatmentrelated complications one of sepsis during treatment with CMED and one of bleomycininduced lung fibrosis No patient developed stomach perforation or bleeding as a result of chemotherapy or radiotherapy Twentyfour of the 26 surviving patients were able to retain their stomachs One patient required a gastrectomy for progressive disease during chemotherapy and another required a subtotal gastrectomy for relief of an obstruction caused by cicatrization These data show that surgery is not a necessary procedure in gastric lymphoma Favorable results can be achieved by combining effective chemotherapy and local radiation
S806	The immunologic basis of homotypic and heterotypic protection by immunization with two candidate rotavirus vaccine strains simian strain RRV and bovine strain WC3 respectively was investigated Mice were orally inoculated with RRV and 6 d later splenic lymphocytes lysed target cells infected with RRV serotype 3 but not with human rotavirus serotypes 1 or 2 4 w after inoculation cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTLs generated in vitro from CTL precursors were also strainspecific Also the frequency of RRVspecific CTLs from CTLp after RRV immunization was 20fold greater than that of crossreactive CTLs Inoculation of mice with WC3 serotype 6 on the other hand produced crossreactive CTLs from CTLp at 4 w CTLs lysed target cells infected with WC3 or human serotypes 1 2 or 3 to the same extent The frequency of crossreactive CTLs after WC3 immunization was greater than or equal to 20fold greater than that of WC3specific CTLs Crossreactive rotavirusspecific CTLs induced after WC3 immunization may in part explain the immunologic basis of protection against heterotypic challenge
S807	High field strength MR imaging systems may require several kilowatts of RF power to obtain images A fraction of this power is absorbed by the patient and changes in body temperature have been measured in experimental animals The purpose of this study was to quantify changes in body surface temperature and other physiologic parameters in humans during MR scanning at 15 T Blood pressure heart rate respiration and axillary temperature measurements were obtained on 27 normal volunteers Measurements were made at RF power levels of 0 02 and 08 Wkg with the power sequence randomized In 14 volunteers receiving lumbar scans statistically significant increases in temperature were observed at RF power levels of 02 02  01 degree C and 08 05  01 degree C Wkg No significant changes related to RF power were observed in blood pressure or respiratory rate At the 08 Wkg level there was a slight increase in heart rate 3  13 beats per minute In the 13 patients receiving head scans physiologic changes were substantially smaller The temperature increases and other physiologic changes observed during MR scanning with the 15 T imager at RF powers of 02 and 08 Wkg were small and of no clinical concern Additional studies should be performed in patients with cardiac failure vascular occulusion and metallic implants or prostheses
S808	Eighteen patients with pulmonary lesions of histiocytosis X were studied with highresolution computed tomography CT Thinwalled cysts were found in all but one patient The other abnormalities included nodules n  14 cavitated nodules n  3 thickwalled cysts n  7 reticulation n  4 groundglass opacities n  4 and irregular interfaces n  4 The lesions were most often diffuse n  16 with a topographic predominance in the upper or middle lung zones in nine patients Comparison of CT scans and chest radiographs shows that small and large cysts and micronodules are better detected with CT Comparison of abnormalities found in patients in the early and late stages of the disease as well as the evolution observed in one case suggests that CT patterns progress from nodules to cavitated nodules and thickwalled cysts to cysts to confluent cysts
S809	1 The effects of medium glucose concentration 020 mmoll and flow 10033 of normal on lactate uptake at low lactate concentration were studied in perfused livers from 48hstarved rats with perfusate pH values of 74 and 68 2 Lactate uptake was independent of glucose concentration in the range 510 mmoll but was slightly inhibited with time at 20 mmoll glucose This pattern was independent of perfusate pH 3 At both pH values lactate uptake decreased proportionally with flow and at low flow lactate was produced by the livers The effect of flow was greatest at pH 74 where a net lactate production was found at 48 of normal flow whereas at pH 68 lactate production was not seen until the flow was reduced to 33 of normal 4 When glucose was omitted from the perfusate lactate production ceased at both pH values 5 The effect of low pH on lactate uptake and production in liver probably reflects inhibition of glycolysis by low pH
S810	In conclusion the concept of endopyelotomy remains extremely attractive and the early results appear promising However the methodology appears to be far in advance of the actual science Objective studies with furosemide washout renography or Whitaker tests prior to endopyelotomy and at 1 year following endopyelotomy are lacking Currently because of its lessinvasive nature lack of external catheters and rapid convalescence we are continuing to use a ureteroscopic approach to endopyelotomy However although this method overall represents a lessinvasive approach the reader is cautioned to keep in mind that our patient series is too small and the followup is too brief for any conclusions to yet be drawn in favor of this method
S811	Twodimensional echocardiography has provided information to aid in the diagnosis and management of infants with ventricular septal defect but its inability to resolve very small ventricular septal defects and problems with defining ventricular septal defect orifice size because of overlying muscle or tricuspid tissue have made it unsuitable as a standard for defining the natural history of ventricular septal defect In this study 114 serial twodimensional Doppler color flow mapping studies were performed to define ventricular septal defect anatomy location and color flow diameter as an indicator of shunt size in 66 patients over a 40 month period Twentyfive patients first studied at 6 months of age mean age at most recent study 159 months had congestive heart failure and 41 mean age 45 months did not In the congestive heart failure group there were 24 perimembranous and 1 muscular ventricular septal defect and aneurysm formation was present in 17 Mean  SD color flow diameter was 82  19 mm and color flow diameteraortic root diameter ratio was 063 In the 30 patients who underwent cardiac catheterization color flow diameter bore a close relation to angiographic diameter r  096 and pulmonarysystemic flow ratio QpQs r  088 In the patients with congestive heart failure 4 of the 25 ventricular septal defects all with aneurysm present or positioned adjacent to the tricuspid valve became smaller but none closed Of the 41 patients without congestive heart failure 21 had a perimembranous defect 15 with aneurysm 18 had a muscular ventricular septal defect and 2 had a supracristal ventricular septal defectABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S812	Spectrin Tunis Sp alpha I78 is an alpha l domain variant that causes asymptomatic elliptocytosis in the heterozygote state It is manifested by a reduction of spectrin dimer selfassociation and by the development of a major 78Kd fragment at the expense of the alpha l 80Kd fragment upon spectrinlimited digestion Amino acid sequence analysis following peptide transfer onto Immobilon membranes showed that the 78Kd fragment results from a sensitized cleavage after lysyl residue 10 Using a 135kb genomic alphaspectrin probe and the Xbal Pvull and Mspl polymorphic sites detected with this probe we concluded that spectrin Tunis is associated with the    haplotype in the above order Twenty mer oligonucleotides complementary to genomic segments from introns 2 and 3 respectively were synthesized We then performed DNA amplification and sequencing In the two investigated carriers of spectrin Tunis we found the CT base substitution of the codon corresponding to position 35 of the alpha l domain CGGTGG ArgTrp The mutation lies in the last part of an alpha helix that extends from residues 9 to 44 of partial repeat alpha 1 and is comparable with helix 3 of full repeats 1 to 5 The modified proteolytic site located 25 amino acid residues upstream occurs at the beginning of the helix
S813	Cefonicid 15 mgkg was administered intravenously at a constant rate of infusion over 15 min to 10 geriatric patients mean age 77 years and to 4 young subjects mean age 35 years Modeldependent and noncompartmental pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated and found to be congruous noncompartmental data are reported Significant differences in the values for area under the curve mean residence time total body clearance and renal clearance were observed between the geriatric and young groups Mean elimination halflife values were 959 and 488 h for the geriatric and young groups respectively Total body and renal clearances were inversely correlated to age and directly correlated to creatinine clearance Free fraction was not correlated to albumin concentration but was correlated exponentially to total cefonicid concentration Despite the prolonged halflife values observed in our geriatric patients the difference in mean trough concentrations was slight Daily administration of a 15mgkg dose should provide adequate concentrations in serum and should not produce appreciable accumulation in geriatric patients
S814	Thirteen dogs affected with Xlinked Duchennes muscular dystrophy and 11 female carrier dogs were studied by electrocardiography ECG and echocardiography Twelve of the affected dogs were studied as immature animals and followed at 1 to 6 month intervals until they were 7 to 46 months of age Compared with control dogs affected dogs had significantly increased p less than 002 QR ratios in ECG leads II III aVF CV6LL V2 and CV6LU V4 Carrier dogs had significantly increased p less than 002 QR ratios in leads V2 and V4 The QR ratio increased in three of six dogs followed up from age 6 months to greater than 2 years The PR intervals were significantly shorter p less than 002 in affected dogs Ventricular arrhythmias were identified in four of six mature affected dogs Twodimensional echocardiography revealed distinctive hyperechoic lesions in 12 of the 13 affected dogs and in 6 of the 11 carrier dogs Hyperechoic lesions corresponded to calcified myocardium and surrounding dense connective tissue This study establishes the dog affected with Duchennes muscular dystrophy as an animal model of Duchennes cardiomyopathy and demonstrates that the heart in carrier dogs is affected by the dystrophic process
S815	Sedativehypnotic drugs for the treatment of chronic insomnia are generally considered ineffective by most experts but helpful by many patients Occasionally insomniainduced debilitations may be remedied by longterm use of sedativehypnotic drugs some examples are given The present discrepancy between expert and patient opinion may be derived from current research practices The improbability that series of sedativehypnotic drug trials will be carried out for patients with insomnia further biases against observation of rarer but clinically significant distinctions among these drugs
S816	There are several treatments from which to choose for the patient with symptomatic uterine prolapse who wishes to retain fertility Transabdominal construction of a sacrocervical ligament with transplanted fascia lata femoris is a useful solution to this problem The technique is described
S817	STUDY OBJECTIVE To confirm the antitumor efficacy of treatment with interleukin2 and lymphokineactivated killer cells in patients with metastatic renal cancer DESIGN Nonrandomized phase II clinical trial SETTING Tertiary care units in university medical centers PATIENTS Consecutive trial of 35 patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell cancer who have bidimensionally measurable disease performance status 0 or 1 and normal function of all vital organs Thirtytwo patients completed interleukin2 priming and received at least one lymphokineactivated killer cell infusion Three patients were removed from the study and did not receive infusion of cells secondary to rapid tumor progression or toxicity INTERVENTIONS Patients initially received recombinant interleukin2 100000 unitskg body weight every 8 hours on days 1 to 5 in a priming phase to stimulate lymphokineactivated killer cell precursors and effector activity in vivo Leukapheresis was done on days 8 to 12 and lymphocytes were cultured in vitro with interleukin2 for 3 to 4 days to amplify lymphokineactivated killer cell activity Finally interleukin2 100000 unitskg every 8 hours was infused with cultured cells on days 12 to 16 All doses of interleukin2 and lymphokineactivated killer cells were administered in intensive care units MEASUREMENTS and MAIN RESULTS The mean number of doses of interleukin2 administered during the priming phase was 129  04 the mean number of lymphokineactivated killer cells reinfused was 70  06 X 1010 and the mean number of interleukin2 doses administered during the last phase was 102  06 The overall objective response rate was 16 two patients had complete responses and three patients had partial responses with greater than 50 reduction of all measurable tumor The complete responders remain diseasefree at 12 and 9 months Two partial responders have not had tumor regrowth at 16 and 15 months The third partial responder relapsed at 4 months Toxicity was severe but generally of short duration and manageable There were no treatmentrelated deaths Hypotension weight gain anemia and elevations of serum creatinine levels and liver enzymes were common Two patients required intubation one patient had a myocardial infarction Conclusions This phase II study confirms the antitumor activity of interleukin2 and lymphokineactivated killer cell therapy in patients with metastatic or unresectable renal cell cancer Response rates especially complete remission rates are comparable or better than rates achieved with other forms of therapy
S818	Hypertonic aerosol and dry airflowinduced bronchoconstriction were examined in the canine lung periphery by the use of a wedged bronchoscope technique Collateral resistance was measured in anesthetized dogs before and after exposure to isotonic and hypertonic aerosols and dry airflow Hypertonic aerosols produced significantly greater responses than isotonic aerosols and resistance increased in an exposuredependent manner Atropine attenuated responses to these challenges indicating that aerosolinduced peripheral lung constriction was in part muscarinic in origin Paired hypertonic and dry airflowinduced constriction exhibited marked differences in magnitude and time course responses to hypertonic aerosol peaked immediately dry airinduced responses rose slowly to a maximum 5min postchallenge These differences may reflect differences in stimulus strength or differences in the regulatory pathways activated by each challenge Despite this a significant correlation exists between aerosol and dry airinduced responses in the canine lung periphery and suggests that changes in airway fluid osmolality have an important role in the initiation of airflowinduced bronchoconstriction
S819	The incidence of postpartum thyroiditis PPT in the general population has been reported to range from 19 to 167 depending on the study To determine whether bias may have played a role in the generation of these widely varying estimates a set of methodologic criteria were applied to the published original research dealing with the epidemiology of PPT The articles that passed these methodologic filters reported a narrow range of incidences of PPT varying between 37 and 59 Reanalysis of these articles confirmed that thyrotoxicosis occurred more frequently in the first 3 months post partum than did hypothyroidism and that a positive antimicrosomal antibody titer was strongly associated with postpartum thyroid dysfunction odds ratio 866 95 confidence interval 459 to 1632 This article suggests that PPT is a common condition that occurs in the postpartum period The best estimate of the incidence of PPT in an unselected cohort of postpartum women is 49
S820	In a prospective study of 145 women bacterial vaginosis was clinically diagnosed in 46 women Compared with clinical diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis detection of socalled clue cells in Papanicolaou smears showed a sensitivity of 90 and a specificity of 97 The positive and negative predictive values were 94 and 95 respectively The study results indicate that demonstration of clue cells in Papanicolaou smears is a useful method for identification of women with probable bacterial vaginosis This provides a basis for the use of archival material in retrospective studies with regard to possible links between bacterial vaginosis and development of cervical cancer
S821	Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of cineangiography were evaluated by multivariate logistic discriminant analysis in 32 patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular RV cardiomyopathy 27 patients with biventricular dilated cardiomyopathy 28 patients with atrial septal defect and 18 normal subjects In patients with arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy and biventricular dilated cardiomyopathy the diagnosis was confirmed by endomyocardial biopsy All RV values overlapped for the diagnosis of atrial septal defect and arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy overlapping extended to dilated cardiomyopathy for enddiastolic volume and infundibular dimensions RV ejection fraction appeared reduced in all the diseases in particular mean values in dilated cardiomyopathy and arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy were 38 and 53 respectively p less than 005 Left ventricular quantitative studies showed a significant difference between dilated and arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy both in terms of pumping indexes mean enddiastolic volumes 180 vs 91 mlm2 and mean ejection fraction 33 vs 60 and indexes of contractility stressenddiastolic volume 37 vs 67 Multivariate analysis disclosed that transversally arranged hypertrophic trabeculae separated by deep fissures were associated with the highest probability of arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy p less than 0001 Posterior subtricuspid and anterior infundibular wall bulgings were the only other independently significant variables Coexistence of these signs was associated with 96 specificity and 875 sensitivity Thus arrhythmogenic RV cardiomyopathy presents quantitative volumetric and hemodynamic as well as qualitative features that clearly distinguish it from dilated cardiomyopathy and confirm its nosographic autonomy among the primary diseases of the myocardium
S822	A review of uncommon skin tumours all of which characteristically arise in elderly patients is presented Angiosarcoma of the face and scalp is a highly progressive tumour with a poor prognosis but initially it may be misdiagnosed as a simple bruise or cellulitis In welldifferentiated tumours a characteristic feature is interlacing endothelial celllined channels showing considerable nuclear atypia Merkel cell tumours which develop as deepseated nodules in the skin occur most frequently in photodamaged areas especially on the head and neck The prognosis of Merkel cell tumours is generally poor histological evidence suggests that some of these tumours may be a special type of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma Atypical fibroxanthoma which is normally benign occurs most frequently in elderly fairskinned males especially around the face It is typically a polypoid lesion with a vascular appearance Acantholytic squamous cell carcinomas also known as adenoid squamous cell carcinomas are most common in fairskinned men with a history of keratoses They also occur in the female genital region and the oral mucosa Histologically these tumours differ from squamous cell carcinomas because of their tendency to form ductlike areas in tumour lobules
S823	This prospective randomized study was undertaken to determine the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy compared with no therapy for bacteriuria in elderly ambulatory nonhospitalized women Sixtyone women mean age 858 years with bacteriuria were in the no therapy control group and 63 women mean age 858 years with bacteriuria were in the therapy group none had symptoms of urinary tract infection One short course of antimicrobial therapy achieved a cure rate of 683 43 of 63 women cured two weeks after treatment During the sixmonth followup period ten 164 of 61 women in the no therapy group and five 79 of 63 women in the therapy group developed symptomatic urinary tract infection At the time of sixmonth followup 19 345 of 55 women in the no therapy group and 35 636 of 55 women in the therapy group did not have bacteriuria We conclude that for asymptomatic bacteriuria in elderly ambulatory nonhospitalized women shortcourse antimicrobial therapy is effective at twoweek followup and that antimicrobial therapy can eliminate bacteriuria in most of these women for at least a sixmonth period
S824	We studied the calcium content and mechanical strength of cortical bone from rats and dogs after different periods of demineralisation showing that the rate of demineralisation differed considerably between the species Specimens from the rat were further treated by chemical extraction and autolysis and tested for osteoinductive properties We showed that partially demineralised cortical bone retained adequate mechanical strength while retaining the biological effects of completely demineralised bone This shows that it is possible to prepare allografts which have adequate mechanical strength and still retain osteoinductive properties

S826	Clinical and metabolic features of chlorpropamide toxicity are described in two patients with diabetes mellitus and accidental chlorpropamide overdosage Elevated serum insulin levels were found during hypoglycemia in both patients The worlds literature was reviewed for other cases of chlorpropamide toxicity in which insulin levels have been measured during hypoglycemia A consistent feature of chlorpropamide toxicity is hyperinsulinemia It is concluded that stimulation of the pancreatic beta cells during chlorpropamide toxicity leads to hyperinsulinemia and hypoglycemia
S827	The molecular mechanisms of somatostatin SRIF desensitization were investigated in the anterior pituitary tumor cell line AtT20 Previous studies have shown that pretreatment of AtT20 cells with SRIF analogs desensitizes the cells to SRIF inhibition of hormone release cyclic AMP formation and calcium influx This desensitization may involve a change in the properties of the SRIF receptors Pretreatment of AtT20 cells with Trp8SRIF reduced the binding of the SRIF analog 125ICGP 23996 desAlal Gly2desaminoCys3 Tyr113 14dicarbasomatostatin to AtT20 cell membranes The loss of 125ICGP 23996 binding was dependent on the time of Trp8SRIF treatment and was reversible The ability of GTP analogs to inhibit 125ICGP 23996 binding was reduced after Trp8SRIF treatment suggesting that the SRIF receptor and the inhibitory G proteins become uncoupled during desensitization This is indicated further by the decrease in SRIF stimulation of GTPase activity and SRIF inhibition of forskolinstimulated adenylyl cyclase activity in desensitized membranes The reduction and recovery of SRIF inhibition of adenylyl cyclase activity after Trp8SRIF pretreatment has a similar time course as the changes in 125ICGP 23996 binding GTP inhibition of forskolinstimulated adenylyl cyclase activity is also reduced in SRIFdesensitized membranes The loss of the GTP effect occurs rapidly and does not fully recover after Trp8SRIF pretreatment The levels of ADPribosylation of inhibitory GTP binding protein the relative quantity of the alpha subunits of the inhibitory G proteins and their electrophoretic mobility after 2dimensional gel electrophoretic analysis are not altered in SRIFdesensitized membranesABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S828	Longitudinal measures of grating acuity were obtained from 16 children after early surgery optical correction and occlusion therapy for congenital unilateral cataract Compliance with contact lens wear and occlusion therapy was good in this population Monocular grating acuities were obtained by preferential looking during months 1 through 15 and by an operant procedure during months 16 through 53 Grating acuities of normal eyes did not differ from those obtained in an agematched normal population and showed no evidence of occlusion amblyopia During the first year of life grating acuities of aphakic eyes were typically within the normal range but lagged behind normal development during years 2 through 4 These results suggest that early surgery is associated with favorable longterm visual results but does not even with good compliance completely eliminate deprivation amblyopia
S829	The pharmacokinetics of furosemide were studied longitudinally during longterm administration in 10 very low birth weight infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia Mean birth weight of the infants was 829  217 g mean gestational age at birth was 266  29 weeks and mean postnatal age at the start of therapy was 24  10 weeks Serial determinations of furosemide pharmacokinetic parameters were performed during 2 weeks to 3 months of longterm therapy Plasma halflife was prolonged in infants less than 31 weeks postconceptional age gestational  postnatal age frequently exceeding 24 hours All infants less than 29 weeks postconceptional age whose dosing schedule was once every 12 hours accumulated furosemide to potentially ototoxic levels Furosemide renal clearance increased and plasma halflife decreased in association with increasing postconceptional age Furosemide secretory clearance was very low in patients less than 31 weeks postconceptional age resulting in a reliance on glomerular filtration to deliver drug to its main site of action within the lumen of the loop of Henle Thus elevated plasma levels may be required to ensure adequate luminal delivery and adequate diuresis in these infants with low secretory clearance Nevertheless the current dosing schedule once every 12 hours of furosemide should be modified to once every 24 hours in infants of low postconceptional age to avoid possible toxic effects
S830	Early electrical therapy for patients with ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia can result in a significant increase of lives saved from sudden cardiac death Rapid defibrillation has become a goal of prehospital and emergency department cardiac care and the use of automatic external defibrillators can aid in reaching this objective The history mechanics and implications of automatic external defibrillators are presented

S832	OBJECTIVETo see whether investigation of dyspeptic patients aged over 40 after their first consultation with the general practitioner would increase the proportions with early and operable gastric cancers DESIGNProspective study of gastric cancer in dyspeptic patients aged over 40 from a defined population SETTING10 General practices six in central Birmingham four in Sandwell the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham and Sandwell District General Hospital PATIENTS2659 Patients aged 40 or over referred with dyspepsia MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREIncrease in early and operable gastric cancers detected in middle aged patients with dyspepsia RESULTSDisease was identified in 1992 patients 75 Fifty seven were found to have gastric cancer 36 being treated by potentially curative resection including 15 with early cancer CONCLUSIONSThe investigation of dyspeptic patients over 40 at first attendance can increase the proportion of early gastric cancers detected to 26 and the proportion of operable cases to 63 Such a policy has the potential to reduce mortality from gastric cancer in the population
S833	The influence of fresh gas flow FGF setting on rebreathing was investigated in 15 infants and children weight 35218 kg during balanced anaesthesia with mechanically controlled ventilation using a Tpiece Mapleson E system and a Nuffield ventilator 200 Tidal volume VT minute volume VE maximal inspired PICO2 and endtidal PECO2 carbon dioxide tensions and airway pressure were measured VE set to produce a PECO2 of about 45 kPa and measured at a high FGF minimal rebreathing was unchanged throughout the study and the regression equation for VE and weight was VE ml min1  146 x kg  482 r  092 Measurements were then repeated at FGFVE ratios reduced to 15 and 10 To achieve minimal rebreathing PICO2 less than 05 kPa FGFVE ratios greater than 18 range 1849 had to be used At FGFVE ratios of 15 some alveolar rebreathing occurred indicated by increased inspired P less than 0001 and endtidal P less than 0001 carbon dioxide tensions At FGFVE ratios equal to 10 alveolar rebreathing was more pronounced and hypercapnoea occurred with a PECO2 mean  1 SD of 589  053 kPa At this FGF setting change in IE ratio from 12 to 11 did not influence the level of alveolar rebreathing A minimal FGF ml min1 setting of 15 x VE that is 15 146 x kg  482 approximated to the expression 200 x kg  1000 is recommended for controlled ventilation to avoid hypercapnoea when using the Tpiece system in children weighing less than 20 kg
S834	Monomeric human gammaglobulin HGG when injected into adult mice induces a state of specific immunologic unresponsiveness to further challenge with immunogenic forms of HGG In this report we have directly determined the role of the thymus in the induction of HGG tolerance and the proliferative responsiveness of T cells from normal and HGGtolerant mice Draining lymph node T cells were isolated from HGGtolerized and challenged mice and tested for their proliferative response to HGG in vitro T cells from untreated but challenged adult CBACaJ and AJ mice proliferate in response to HGG whereas such mice given monomeric HGG before challenge fail to show an HGGspecific proliferative response APC from tolerant or nontolerant mice were equally effective in the support of Agspecific proliferation of primed T cells The influence of the thymus gland on HGGinduced T cell unresponsiveness was assessed by determining whether thymectomized mice could be tolerized to HGG The results suggest that the generation of T cell tolerance to HGG is independent of thymic function as assayed by both antibody production in vivo and T cell proliferation in vitro Unresponsiveness of T cells from tolerant mice was not a result of the presence of CD8 cells since removal of CD8 cells from lymph node T cells did not alter unresponsiveness to HGG in vitro Further mixing tolerant T cells with normal HGGprimed T lymphocytes did not inhibit proliferation of the HGGprimed cells The results of this investigation suggest that this mouse model of tolerance to HGG represents a thymusindependent unresponsiveness of mature peripheral T cells to a nonselfAg Understanding the regulation of tolerance to HGG may give additional insight into the mechanisms required for the maintenance and possibly the induction of tolerance to certain selfAg in peripheral lymphoid organs
S835	From a multivariate analysis of more than 14200 patientyears experience with papillary thyroid carcinoma PTC we devised a prognostic scoring system based on patient age tumor grade extent and size AGES This scoring system can identify patients at increased risk of PTC mortality and was employed as an adjustment variable for analyzing the role of different types of surgical treatment in 860 PTC patients Cancer mortality at 25 years in patients with an AGES score of 399 or less was 1 after ipsilateral lobectomy n  131 and 2 after bilateral resection n  603 whether subtotal or total p  015 Of patients with an AGES score of 4 or more those who underwent lobectomy alone n  30 had a mortality rate from PTC at 25 years of 65 while those undergoing bilateral resection n  86 had a lower rate of 35 p  006 For patients at minimal risk score of 399 or less of PTC death no improvement in survival was demonstrable when patients underwent more than ipsilateral lobectomy However in a subgroup score of 4 or more identified to be at significant risk of PTC death the survival after bilateral resection was much higher than after ipsilateral lobectomy alone In neither the minimal nor the higher risk subgroup was PTC survival significantly improved by the performance of total thyroidectomy
S836	In conclusion I hope that my comments have reaffirmed your biases or even more importantly stimulated you to think in a different way about the information explosion in our specialty and medicine in general I believe our specialty is in a golden era that will benefit from the past and be nourished by new discoveries and understanding We as clinicians must accept the challenge of recognizing what new information deserves incorporation into our practice what old information deserves to be sustained and what merits new scrutiny and perhaps should be discarded If I had one wish it would be that anesthesiologists would never lose their zeal to be studentstheir thirst for new informationas the continuum of anesthesia education is indeed a lifelong process That wish ladies and gentlemen is my challenge to all anesthesiologists
S837	The nonrecirculating isolated perfused rat liver was used to study biliary antibiotic excretion by the liver in a steadystate controlled environment in which bile flow bile salt output and antibiotic delivery were maintained under constant conditions The effects of piperacillin ampicillin and gentamicin on bile flow and bile salt output were analyzed none altered bile salt output and only high concentrations of piperacillin 100 microgramsmL increased bile flow The ratio of antibiotic concentration in bile and perfusate depended on the type of antibiotic and perfusate concentration Piperacillin infusions at perfusate concentrations of 50 or 100 microgramsmL in the presence of 60 microM taurocholate yielded bile to perfusate ratios of 112  10 versus 49  3 respectively Using similar perfusate the concentration ratios for ampicillin 20 microgramsmL and gentamicin 10 microgramsmL were only 34  05 and 05  01 respectively By altering the perfusate to contain either 60 microM or 240 microM taurocholate we found variance in bile salt output from 27  1 to 115  2 mumolh yet this alteration had little effect on the output of ampicillin perfusate concentration of 20 microgramsmL 73  7 versus 74  12 microgramsh or piperacillin perfusate concentration 100 microgramsmL 10  1 versus 11  2 mgh Thus it appears ampicillin and piperacillin are excreted into bile at high concentrations by bile saltindependent pathways Partial biliary obstruction 6 cm H2O results in significant decreases in bile volume Infusion of 50 microgramsmL of piperacillin resulted in increased biliary flow that approached nonobstructed values Obstruction resulted in significant decreases in bile piperacillin concentration Whether the choleretic effect of high concentrations of piperacillin has any clinical significance in nonobstructed or obstructed conditions remains to be established
S838	For evaluation of the feasibility and clinical potential of using the phase data from standard MR imaging sequences to measure blood flow 11 vessels with diameters of 4 to 7 mm were imaged in seven dogs The flow in either the superior mesenteric vein or the inferior vena cava was measured first at laparotomy in mlmin with electromagnetic flow meters Immediately thereafter these vessels were imaged by MR in 25mm thick sections by using a standard spin echo SE 75030 sequence with a Philips 05T imager Previous phaseflow calibration of the imager and sequence allowed calculation of the blood flow rates from the phase images that were used to measure the vessels crosssectional areas and blood phase values Comparison of the measurements obtained with each technique showed a significant correlation r  977 p less than 05 between MRimaging values and flowmeter measurements when the blood velocity was less than approximately 40 cmsec the known upper limit of the flow dynamic range for the MR hardware and sequence used There was no correlation for blood velocities greater than 40 cmsec However the range of blood flow velocities in dogs and man extends to more than 100 cmsec Thus these results suggest that this technique might yield valuable adjunctive flow data in routine clinical imaging provided that improvements in hardware and software permit a larger dynamic range
S839	The quadrilateral space syndrome is a recently established entity with seemingly consistent pathological and radiographic features An example of this syndrome is reported In this patient entrapment of the axillary nerve by fibrous bands in the quadrilateral space caused shoulder pain with paresthesias in the upper extremity Subclavian angiography provided the diagnosis by demonstrating that the posterior humeral circumflex artery which was normal when the arm was in a neutral position was occluded when the arm was abducted and externally rotated Axillary neurolysis through a posterior approach resulted in relief of symptoms
S840	We investigated the effect of highdose prednisone therapy in 33 boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy The drug was given daily in doses of 15 mgkg of body weight to a maximum of 80 mg for six months Muscle strength joint contractures timed functional tests functional ability and pulmonary function were measured at the beginning and end of the treatment period The trial was designed using natural history controls and the power of the study was 080 to detect a slowing of 50 in the rate of progression During the period of the trial muscle strength functional grades timed functional tests and pulmonary function improved Contractures followed the expected natural history of the illness
S841	A review of 96 consecutive patients who underwent palliative surgery for primary colorectal cancer was undertaken to clarify the value of palliation achieved with surgical treatment The overall rate of postoperative mortality was 8 percent 8 of 96 and the overall rate of postoperative morbidity was 24 percent 23 of 96 The mortality rate was 5 percent 3 of 66 after resective surgery and 17 percent 5 of 30 after nonresective surgery Three deaths were related to the malignant disease three were related to the intraabdominal infection and two were related to formation of intestinocutaneous fistulas Of the 8 patients who died 1 had a tumor with local visceral involvement only and 7 had a tumor with more distant spread Median survival was 10 months for all patients 15 months for patients treated with resective surgery and 7 months for nonresected patients Five patients 5 percent have survived for longer than 5 years The median relief of preoperative cancer symptoms was 4 months 4 months after resective surgery and 1 month after nonresective surgery Twentyfive patients have undergone second surgery It is concluded that palliative resective surgery for colorectal cancer can improve patient comfort with an acceptable postoperative mortality rate when cancer growth is localized and in favorable cases with more distant spread whereas nonresective surgery fails to achieve symptom relief
S842	Several noninvasive techniques based on different physical principles have been developed to investigate skin function and have been used for patch test assessment In the present paper the advantages and the defects of these methods are described in the light of the more recent data available in literature Meanwhile the eye and the fingers still remain the simplest method to assess skin irritancy Bioengineering techniques could provide efficient recording systems for monitoring skin color skin blood flow and barrier function damage useful to the investigator rather than to the clinician
S843	Assessment of the pulsatile mechanical behavior of the coupled left ventricle and the peripheral arterial circulation requires accurate estimation of instantaneous aortic flow Before the availability of Doppler technologies this could only be achieved by invasive techniques The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of Dopplerbased measurement of instantaneous aortic blood flow and waveform morphology throughout ventricular ejection when compared with an established invasive method Accordingly data from electromagnetic flow and continuouswave aortic Doppler recordings were simultaneously acquired and compared in five monkeys over a wide range of flows generated by intravenous infusions of the betaadrenoceptor agonist dobutamine and the alphareceptor agonist methoxamine Instantaneous aortic pressure was measured using a highfidelity micromanometertipped catheter placed in the ascending aorta Excellent correlations were noted for stroke volume cardiac output left ventricular ejection time maximal flow velocity and maximal rate of change of flow velocity dQdtmax When compared with electromagnetic flows continuouswave aortic Doppler had significantly lower times to maximal flow velocity and dQdtmax Frequency domain analysis indicated that both the magnitude and phase were within  6 up to the third harmonic Instantaneous comparison disclosed that during early systole up to 10 of ejection Doppler was higher than electromagnetic flow rate by 11  19 p less than 005 At 2030 of systolic ejection electromagnetic flow rates were slightly higher than Doppler 5  4 at 20 of ejection p less than 0001 and 2  3 at 30 of ejection p less than 005 From 40 of ejection to the end of systole flow rates using both techniques were virtually identicalABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S844	Epidemiologic casestudy and cohortstudy data concerning effects of estrogen replacement therapy on the risk of cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women are reviewed Although there is conflicting literature most research strongly suggests that estrogens and estrogen replacement therapy in particular reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease Such reduced risk in estrogen users is most likely mediated in part by the beneficial effects of estrogen therapy on lipid metabolism Risks associated with the use of estrogens and possible effects when progestational agents are added to an estrogen regimen are also discussed
S845	Tables containing 23 entries for estimating fetal weight with ultrasound parameters have proven to be equivalent to the longer tables in current use
S846	Translocations involving chromosomes 8 and 14 in Burkitts lymphoma BL often involve the switch mu Smu region on chromosome 14 which contains multiple repeats This has enabled us to use the polymerase chain reaction PCR to detect breakpoints that involve this region on chromosome 14 and the cmyc gene on chromosome 8 Using pairs of flanking primers each pair including one annealing to repeat sequences within the switch region and one of three primers from the cmyc region first intron 3 or 5 flanking sequence of the first exon of cmyc we have been able to amplify DNA fragments containing the corresponding breakpoint regions from chromosome 14 in both cell lines and biopsied tumor samples The definitive demonstration of sequences from both chromosomes in these fragments permitted the confirmation of the presence of a translocation Because of the sensitivity of PCR we were able to localize breakpoints in samples containing as few as 1 neoplastic cell in 108 cells PCR provides a valuable tool for the detection of 814 chromosomal translocations which should prove to be of value in diagnosis and molecular epidemiologic studies as well as providing a means of detecting minimal disease
S847	Closure of the nostril in atrophic rhinitis is a simple operation Opening the obturated nose by excising the obturator membrane very often causes stenosis A new and effective method for opening the nostrils by means of flaps is suggested
S848	Juvenile xanthogranuloma presenting as an isolated corneoscleral lesion is rare We report such a case in a 5yearold boy who required lamellar sclerokeratectomy to the level of Descemets membrane Ten months after treatment by total excision and lamellar corneoscleral grafting with donor tissue there was no evidence of recurrence We discuss the clinical and histologic features of this disorder the differential diagnosis and treatment options
S849	OBJECTIVETo compare the efficacy and tolerability of hydrochlorothiazide sustained release verapamil and their combination in patients with mild to moderate hypertension DESIGNRandomised multicentre trial of 48 weeks duration with a double blind comparison of hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil followed by an open trial of combined treatment for patients not achieving the target diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg during treatment with a single drug SETTINGOutpatient departments in 10 clinics and 10 private practices of general practitioners or internists PATIENTS369 Hypertensive patients with a diastolic blood pressure of 95120 mm Hg during a placebo run in period of two weeks INTERVENTIONSInitial treatment consisted of 125 mg hydrochlorothiazide n  187 or 120 mg sustained release verapamil n  182 once daily regimen I If the target diastolic blood pressure of less than 90 mm Hg was not achieved within four weeks doses were increased to 25 mg hydrochlorothiazide or 240 mg verapamil once regimen II and twice daily regimen III Patients not achieving target blood pressure were given the combination of hydrochlorothiazide and verapamilthat is 25 and 240 mg once regimen IV and twice daily regimen V MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREBlood pressure determined with a device permitting automatic repeated measurements with printouts RESULTSAfter eight weeks of treatment with a single drug 76 out of 178 43 and 101 out of 175 58 patients achieved the target blood pressure with hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil respectively During follow up until 48 weeks patients treated with verapamil reached the target blood pressure more often and at lower doses and were less likely to switch to combination treatment than patients randomised to hydrochlorothiazide treatment Adding verapamil to hydrochlorothiazide was more effective than the addition of hydrochlorothiazide to verapamil At the end of the study 42 out of 169 25 and 73 out of 163 45 patients initially randomised to hydrochlorothiazide and verapamil respectively were at target blood pressure without combination treatment After adding verapamil to hydrochlorothiazide or hydrochlorothiazide to verapamil an additional 58 34 and 29 18 patients reached the target blood pressure respectively Altogether 92 out of 332 28 patients failed to achieve target blood pressure with regimen V There were four 10 seven and seven withdrawals due to possible adverse effects to treatment with hydrochlorothiazide verapamil combining verapamil with hydrochlorothiazide and combining hydrochlorothiazide with verapamil respectively CONCLUSIONSIn doses currently used in antihypertensive treatment verapamil was more effective than hydrochlorothiazide as a single agent and in combination in mild to moderate hypertension whereas withdrawal rates caused by side effects possibly related to treatment were similar
S850	Surgical repair of complex thoracic aneurysms requiring aortic valve replacement and coronary revascularization is occasionally complicated by significant bleeding despite the experience of the surgeon While bleeding from the mediastinal tissues and the anterior suture line is usually easily controlled posterior bleeding may require dismantling the repair and a second bypass run The synergism of a second bypass run and continued bleeding may result in increased mortality andor morbidity We recently encountered bleeding in a patient who developed ventricular dysfunction after bypass and opted to interpose a Goretex graft between the aneurysm wall and the right atrium with immediate hemostasis and a benign course Subsequently we used four different shunts successfully in 9 of 33 patients The average bleeding rate 30 minutes after protamine was 221  60 mlminute with a range of 190 to 350 mlminute The initial two hour chest tube drainage averaged 880  285 ml with a range of 490 to 1300 ml There were no reexplorations for bleeding The shunt in the first patient has remained open without cardiac decompensation The last patient developed heart failure and required elective repair of a leak at the descending end of an arch replacement Our experience suggests that these shunts can be effective particularly if posterior suture line bleeding is encountered
S851	Blood transfusions have been shown to prevent allograft rejection to increase the rate of tumor growth and to increase susceptibility to infectious complications We evaluated the mechanism of this immunosuppression by studying the effect of transfusions on macrophage function in a Lewis rat model Allogeneic transfusions were found to decrease macrophage migration in response to inflammatory stimuli and to increase their production of the strongly immunosuppressive arachidonic acid metabolite prostaglandin E Syngeneic transfusions did not alter macrophage migration or arachidonic acid metabolism The immunosuppression seen following transfusions appears to be related to an increased synthesis of prostaglandin E
S852	A great deal is said these days about how important it is for doctors to pay attention to the patients beliefs about his or her disease Better knowledge of such beliefs it is argued will enable the doctor to counter ignorance enhance communication and reduce noncompliance The view advanced here is that the significance of patients beliefs and their frequent resistance to rational correction will emerge only if they are seen as components in a process of narrative reconstruction It is suggested that the main difficulty is not ignorance but rather the fact that doctor and patient have different purposes whereas the doctors objective is to explain the aetiology of the disease the patient may be more concerned to make sense of the disruption caused by the disease
S853	An ultrathinlayer polyacrylamide gel isoelectric focusing technique that uses a composite of ampholytes from three commercial sources is described for subtyping esterase D All common allelic products of esterase D were separated clearly The technique described in this paper provides a higher conclusive call rate on known blood specimens 958 and questioned bloodstains 697 compared with continuous zone electrophoresis in agarose gels 899 and 376 respectively
S854	A critical review was performed to assess studies about Bowens disease as a cutaneous predictor of the development of internal malignancy In six of seven published cohort studies the authors concluded that there was an association between Bowens disease and internal malignancy Three major methodological deficiencies occurred in these studies lack of an adequate comparison group inclusion of persons who already had internal malignancy when Bowens disease was diagnosed and lack of lifetable analysis to describe and to compare cancer incidence rates over time Though an association between Bowens disease and internal malignancy may be pathophysiologically plausible and may eventually be demonstrated we conclude that published reports do not demonstrate that persons with Bowens disease have an increased risk to develop internal malignancy
S855	Interferonalpha and the adenosine deaminase ADA inhibitor deoxycoformycin dCF have each been shown to be efficacious in the treatment of some lymphoid malignancies and to have potent antiproliferative activities in vitro This study examined whether dCF and recombinant interferonalpha A rIFNalpha A were additive synergistic or antagonistic in their effects on the cultured B lymphoblastoid cell line Daudi Treatment of Daudi cells for three to four days with doses of rIFNalpha A that were growth inhibitory was unexpectedly found to increase the level of ADA activity per cell two to threefold and therefore to prevent the inhibition of ADA by limiting concentrations of dCF However the opposite effects of dCF and rIFNalpha A on ADA activity did not lead to antagonistic effects on growth inhibition The higher concentrations of dCF with deoxyadenosine necessary for appreciable growth inhibition could inhibit the increased ADA activity in rIFNalpha Atreated cells thus resulting in additive antiproliferative effects
S856	76 healthy women who had been menopausal for less than 96 months and who had never received any form of treatment to prevent bone loss were entered into a randomised doubleblind study For the first 6 months half the patients received tiludronate 100 mg daily while the others received placebo During the second 6 months all patients received placebo Bone mineral density of the lumbar spine decreased significantly by 21 SE 08 in the placebo group and did not significantly change in the tiludronate group 133 08 The difference in response between the groups was significant as were the differences between values for corrected urinary hydroxyproline and calcium Treatment with tiludronate was not followed by increased secretion of parathyroid hormone A 6 month course of oral tiludronate may counteract postmenopausal bone loss for at least a year by decreasing bone resorption
S857	Accurate aminoacylation of a tRNA by Escherichia coli methionyltRNA synthetase MTS is specified by the CAU anticodon A genetic screening procedure was designed to isolate MTS mutants able to aminoacylate a methionine amber tRNA CUA anticodon Selected suppressor MTS enzymes all possess one or several mutations in the vicinity of Trp461 a residue that is the major contributor to the stability of complexes formed with tRNAs having the cognate CAU anticodon Analysis of catalytic properties of purified suppressor enzymes shows that they have acquired an additional specificity toward the amber anticodon without complete disruption of the methionine anticodon site It is concluded that both positive and negative discrimination toward the binding of tRNA anticodon sequences is restricted to a limited region of the synthetase residues 451467
S858	Flunarizine plasma concentrations and side effects were evaluated in migraine patients during a 3 month course of prophylactic treatment Plasma concentrations did not correlate with daily dose in mgkg Mean flunarizine levels were higher in patients showing sleepiness or sedation Weight gain was independent of plasma concentrations Future clinical trials of flunarizine should be supported by drug monitoring in order to clarify the relationship between plasma levels and drug effects
S859	One hundred thirtyfive hepatocellular carcinomas were examined for the presence of antigenic tumor markers by the avidinbiotinperoxidase complex method Ninetyseven were from the US and 38 came from Argentina The following markers were tested alphafetoprotein AFP alpha1antitrypsin AAT hepatitis B surface antigen HBsAg hepatitis B core antigen HBcAg hepatitis D delta antigen HD delta Ag and Mallorys bodies MB In the US cases AFP was present in 43 AAT in 41 HBsAg in 17 and MB in 48 Both HBcAg and HD delta Ag were absent In the cases from Argentina AFP was found in 26 and AAT in 18 None of the other antigens were seen Thirteen US tumors expressed three antigens and two four antigens simultaneously This study reveals in humans a heterogenous expression of antigens by neoplastic hepatocytes with geographic differences possibly due to multiple factors such as alcohol consumption or prevalence of hepatitis B infection
S860	To evaluate the effects of exercise testing training and beta blockade on serum potassium 40 normal subjects 24 men 16 women mean age 33 years had 4 maximal exercise tests with venipuncture for serum potassium before and less than or equal to 40 seconds after each test After initial exercise testing they were randomized to atenolol 50 mg daily atenolol 100 mg daily propranolol 80 mg twice daily or placebo All began a 9week dynamic exercise program for 8 weeks followed by a 1week drugfree washout period Tests were done after weeks 1 8 and 9 A significant mean increase p less than 005 in serum potassium occurred with maximal exercise in the atenolol 50 mg and propranolol groups after 1 week of treatment mean  standard deviation 478  029 to 509  043 mEqliter and 481  055 to 530  033 mEqliter By week 8 after training all beta blockade groups showed an increase in postmaximal exercise test serum potassium atenolol 50 mg 478  029 to 511  026 mEqliter atenolol 100 mg 495  041 to 516  036 mEqliter propranolol 481  055 to 505  029 mEqliter After washout only the placebo group showed an increase in postmaximal test serum potassium 499  046 to 535  027 mEqliter Data indicate that hyperkalemia with maximal exercise testing increases after training with atenolol and propranolol compared to placebo and that this effect resolves once treatment is discontinued
S861	In this paper we examined in detail the ability of anti1F7 to modulate 1F7 CD26 surface expression as well as analyzed the functional relationship between the surface expression of CD3 CD2 and CD26 and human T cell activation We showed that anti1F7induced modulation is an energydependent process that occurs via capping and internalization of the Agantibody complex Although the recovery rate for Ag reexpression of 1F7 following optimal modulation is relatively delayed reexpression of 1F7 is greatly accelerated following phorbol ester treatment Most importantly we demonstrated that modulation of the CD26 Ag leads to an enhancement in the proliferative activity of modulated human T cells treated with antiCD3 or antiCD2 which is preceded by an enhancement in Ca2 mobilization CD26 modulation also led to an increase in antiCD3 or antiCD2mediated T cell clone proliferation Finally whereas modulation of the CD26 Ag has an effect on CD3 or CD2induced T cell activation modulation of the CD3TCR complex inhibits the proliferative response of T cells incubated with antiCD3 plus anti1F7 or antiCD2 plus anti1F7 However modulation of the CD2 structure does not affect antiCD3 plus anti1F7induced human T cell activation The above results thus provide additional evidence that the CD26 Ag plays an integral role in the regulation of human T cell activation
S862	The gene for protein H a novel bacterial cell wall protein with specific affinity for human IgG Fc was cloned from a group A Streptococcus and expressed in Escherichia coli Recombinant E coli cells produced two forms of a human IgG Fcbinding protein one with an apparent Mr of 42 kDa in a periplasmic fraction and the other with an apparent Mr of 45 kDa in a mixed fraction of cytoplasms and membranes Both 42kDa and 45kDa protein preparations similarly bound to human IgG1 to IgG4 human IgG Fc and rabbit IgG but not to IgG of mouse rat bovine sheep goat and human IgA IgD IgE and IgM The complete nucleotide sequence of the cloned 18kb DNA fragment was determined An open reading frame encoded a hypothetical protein of 376 amino acid residues Mr  42498 The Nterminal amino acid sequence consisting of 41 residues which was removed posttranslationally had typical characteristics of Grampositive bacterial signal peptides Thus the mature form of protein H was suggested to consist of 335 residues Mr  38162 There were 3 repeated sequences consisting of 42 residues that were highly homologous to those of protein Arp an IgAbinding streptococcal cell wall protein and streptococcal M6 and M24 proteins The Cterminal amino acid sequence consisting of 93 residues directly following the repeated sequences was also highly homologous to that of M6 and M24 proteins No sequence homology was found between protein H and protein A or protein G two other IgGbinding bacterial cell wall proteins
S863	Of 192 anterior resections for rectal cancer performed over 10 years by one author RJH 169 88 per cent included total mesorectal excision and all included lavage of the clamped distal rectum Of this series 152 79 per cent were classed as curative 110 with a resection margin greater than 1 cm and 42 with a resection margin less than or equal to 1 cm The group with a greater than 1 cm margin had a significantly lower Dukes A to B ratio than the group with a margin less than or equal to 1 cm although the proportion with Dukes C lesions was similar in both groups chi 2  6712 P  0035 There were no local recurrences in the latter group 95 per cent confidence interval CI is 059 per cent while there were four 36 per cent in the former group 95 per cent CI is 0874 per cent There were no significant differences in recurrence rates local and distant between the two groups Fishers exact test P  02 Reduction of resection margin provided total mesorectal excision and washout is properly performed does not increase local recurrence or compromise survival
S864	The purpose of this study was to describe interactional styles used by nurse practitioners and physicians in their attempts to influence patients decision making The ethical concepts of paternalism maternalism and shared decision making operationalized as command consequence and concordance respectively formed the conceptual framework for the analysis of the interactions Videotaped interactions of 85 physicians and 42 nurse practitioners in either joint or solo practice were analyzed Tests of a priori hypotheses using hierarchical loglinear modeling yielded the following significant results Males and physicians in solo practice used more command statements and fewer consequence statements than females and nurse practitioners in solo practice who used fewer command statements and more consequence statements All groups used more commandconsequence statements than concordance statements
S865	The mean number of cases of Clostridium difficile diarrhea at the Minneapolis Veterans Administration Medical Center increased to 173 per month in JuneAugust 1985 compared with 71 per month in the previous 17 mo Plasmid profiles and clindamycin susceptibility were used as markers to evaluate the increase in cases Ninety clindamycinresistant and 22 clindamycinsusceptible isolates of C difficile from 1985 were examined for plasmids A clindamycinresistant organism contained a cryptic plasmid of 31 kilobases kb None of the clindamycinsusceptible isolates contained the 31kb plasmid as compared with 40 of 90 clindamycinresistant isolates P less than 005 Restriction endonuclease digestion and Southern blot hybridization were used to confirm the identity of the 31kb plasmid between strains Isolates retained clindamycin resistance after plasmid curing It could not be determined if the organism responsible was an indigenous C difficile strain that acquired a plasmid or was a new strain introduced from outside the hospital
S866	To compare the cost effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation and conventional chemotherapy we evaluated the resources used in the care of adult patients with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia who were enrolled in a prospective trial and received induction chemotherapy at a single university hospital Nineteen patients were subsequently treated with chemotherapy and 17 with transplantation Cost accounting began with induction chemotherapy and extended over a fiveyear period Costs were estimated by means of a resourcebased multivariate prediction model The transplantation and chemotherapy groups had virtually equivalent use of resources hospital days laboratory tests blood products and radiologic and operative procedures over five years except for a 10fold increase in the use of the intensive care unit for the patients who underwent transplantation P less than 0001 The total costs over five years were estimated at 193000 per patient for transplantation and 136000 per patient for chemotherapy P  002 At five years the costs per year of life saved lifeyear were nearly equal 62500 per lifeyear for transplantation vs 64000 per lifeyear for chemotherapy because of the better rate of diseasefree survival in patients who underwent bone marrow transplantation We conclude that the cost effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation to treat acute nonlymphocytic leukemia compares favorably with that of chemotherapy and could be further enhanced if intensive care resources were used more selectively
S867	Sorbitol accumulation myoinositol depletion and reduced NaKATPase activity have been identified in experimental diabetes in several tissues in which diabetic complications occur However a reduction in renal NaKATPase activity has not been universally reported prompting us to examine the influence of diabetes duration on the activity of this enzyme complex in isolated glomeruli Additionally we examined the ability of the aldose reductase inhibitor sorbinil to directly stimulate glomerular NaKATPase activity in vitro an area of interest in view of the central position that the ability of sorbinil to restore NaKATPase activity in vivo occupies in the interpretive scheme that links associated changes in sorbitol myoinositol and NaKATPase to enhanced polyolpathway activity Glomerular NaKATPase activity was significantly decreased in rats with acute less than 18 days streptozocininduced diabetes but was significantly greater than control values in rats with more chronic greater than 32 days diabetes In vitro addition of sorbinil 1 x 107 M directly stimulated NaKATPase in control 0627  0090 vs 0843  0098 mumol P1mg1min1 but not diabetic glomeruli These results indicate that the time of examination after induction of diabetes critically influences glomerular NaKATPase activity and suggest that sorbinil at least in normal glomerular tissue has a membraneassociated effect that may be independent of its aldose reductaseinhibiting property
S868	Four monoclonal antibodies BH11 T230 AG3 and BC3 were produced against different epithelial components of the normal thymus An immunohistologic study was performed on 13 thymomas by the use of these and other stromal and lymphocytespecific reagents The aim of this study was to find possible relationships between the proliferating thymoma epithelial cell type and the T cell composition of thymomas Our results indicate that cortical T cell differentiation is present in thymomas and that this differentiation is induced in the absence of detectable levels of MHC class II antigens on the epithelial component in most cases The role of the MHC class II antigens cannot be excluded however because these antigens were always present on macrophages Analysis of the selected group of thymomas each of which contained epithelial cells homogeneously stained by at least one of the described monoclonal antibodies showed that the cortical type T cell inducer capacity of thymomas is independent of the epithelial type predominant in the tumor
S869	The progression of retinopathy was reevaluated at two years in 64 of the 68 patients with mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy originally randomly assigned for an eightmonth period either to intensified diabetic control with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion CSII or to unchanged conventional injection treatment Twentythree of the 34 patients in the former group and 24 of the 34 in the latter agreed to continue to follow their original treatment assignment for a further 16 months The others crossed over at the end of the first eight months of the study During those first eight months substantial lowering of blood glucose concentration had been achieved in the CSII group unexpectedly associated with evidence of accelerated progression of retinopathy compared with the conventional injection treatment group Glycemic separation was maintained at two years between the two groups continuing to receive the assigned treatment during this time the mean retinopathy level deteriorated with conventional injection treatment and improved with CSII At two years the degree of retinopathy in the two treatment groups was indistinguishable with some trend to lesser overall deterioration with CSII It is concluded that in diabetics with mild to moderate nonproliferative retinopathy the acceleration in activity associated with tightened control is not sustained and does not initiate vasoproliferative deterioration in retinopathy
S870	Thymus was interposed in six patients following tracheal reconstruction three tracheoinnominate fistula repairs two resections for stenosis and one repair of a membranous tear during esophagectomy The two resections for stenosis were elective the others were emergent repairs This gland readily accessible in the upper mediastinum is easily dissected from the pleura and pericardium and separated into two lobes Pedicles based at the thoracic inlet measure between 15 and 20 cm by 4 cm Each lobe receives independent arterial blood supply and venous drainage which remains intact even if the innominate vein must be divided to effect tracheal repair All patients survived the perioperative period The patient with the tracheoinnominate fistula died 1 month later No patient had evidence of further vascular complications or tracheal anastomotic leak even though one patient developed a long segment of necrotic trachea Reinforcement following tracheal reconstruction is important in preventing complications from anastomotic leak or vascular erosion The pedicled thymus gland is an excellent readily available interposition flap for emergent or elective tracheal reconstruction
S871	Thirtyeight patients with erythroderma of unknown etiology were diagnosed over a 15year period and represented 19 of all patients admitted to our department for erythroderma The malefemale ratio was 661 and the median disease duration was 2 years range 1 to 23 years Keratoderma of palms andor soles was seen in 79 Laboratory findings were normal except for an increased IgE level in 69 of the patients studied Lymph node histology showed dermatopathic lymphadenopathy Bone marrow investigation results were normal in 48 or showed eosinophilia 32 or hyperplasia 20 Initial skin biopsies showed nonspecific histology in most patients but later biopsies revealed pleomorphic infiltration During the observation period four patients progressed to mycosis fungoides and another nine patients were suspected of having mycosis None developed Sezarys syndrome Only one third of the patients went into complete remission half of them died during the observation period Patients with erythroderma of unknown etiology are predominantly men and seem to belong to a certain subgroupherein called the red man syndrome
S872	To document the in vivo interactions occurring between the immune system and HIV replicating cells we analyzed using in situ hybridization the production of IL1 beta IL6 IL2 and INFgamma in eight hyperplastic lymph nodes from HIV1 infected patients Numerous IL1 beta and IL6producing cells associated in clusters were detected in sinuses Few individual IL1 beta and IL6producing cells were present in interfollicular and follicular areas IL2 and INFgammaproducing cells were observed in all lymph node compartments with a selective enrichment in germinal centers The amount and distribution of IL1 beta IL6 and IL2producing cells in HIV lymph nodes were not different from those found in six HIV unrelated hyperplastic lymph nodes In contrast a higher level of INFgamma production was observed in HIV1 lymph nodes The CD8 cells that accumulate in germinal centers of HIV lymph nodes and not in nonHIV germinal centers were actively involved in this INFgamma production INFgamma synthesizing cells were in direct contact with cells containing HIV core antigens and HIV RNA Thus a high INFgamma production may characterize antiHIV T cell immune response potentially contributing to control of viral spreading as well as to the development of follicle lysis
S873	Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation ECMO has been used in more than 1000 infants in 50 centers in the United States The extracorporeal circuit contains approximately 400 ml of blood an amount exceeding the blood volume of most fullterm neonates The effect of this additional blood volume on drug disposition is unknown In this study we determined the pharmacokinetic parameters of gentamicin in 10 infants on ECMO Gentamicin concentrations were determined by a fluorescence polarization immunoassay Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined from these concentrations by using a twocompartment model Our study demonstrated a mean steadystate volume of distribution of 051  011 literskg a figure similar to that in previous studies of fullterm infants The elimination halflife was found to be prolonged mean 573  263 min The creatinine level in the plasma of the infants was found to be a statistically significant predictor of elimination halflife Recommendations regarding initial dosing levels of gentamicin in infants on ECMO are made
S874	Because of the likely involvement of central convergence of afferent inputs in mechanisms underlying referred pain the activity of single neurones was recorded in the cats trigeminal V subnucleus caudalis medullary dorsal horn to test for the presence and extent of convergent inputs to the neurones In chloraloseanaesthetized or decerebrate unanaesthetized cats electrical stimuli were applied to afferents supplying facial skin oral mucosa canine and premolar tooth pulp laryngeal mucosa cervical skin and muscle and jaw and tongue muscles and tactile and noxious mechanical and thermal stimuli were applied to skin and mucosa Considerable proportions of caudalis neurones which could be functionally classified on the basis of their cutaneous receptive field properties as lowthreshold mechanoreceptive LTM widedynamicrange WDR or nociceptivespecific NS neurones could be excited by electrical stimulation of several of these afferent inputs Extensive convergence of afferent inputs including inputs from skin or mucosal areas outside the neuronal oralfacial receptive field delineated by natural stimuli was a particular feature of the units classified as cutaneous nociceptive neurones ie WDR and NS On the basis of antidromic activation 15 of these WDR and NS neurones were shown to have a direct projection to the contralateral thalamus The findings question the use of terminology and classifications of somatosensory neurones based only on the cutaneous receptive field properties of the neurones since distinctions between the different neuronal populations become less obvious when properties other than those related to cutaneous afferent inputs are taken into account Moreover the observations of extensive convergence of different types of afferents which was especially apparent in cutaneous nociceptive neurones also suggest a role for these neurones in mediating deep pain and in spread and referral of pain
S875	Twelve hydrocephalic patients undergoing hydrodynamic studies and shunt procedures during general anaesthesia were subjected to short term observations of the cerebrovascular effects of isoflurane Intraventricular pressure IVP arterial pressure AP cerebral perfusion pressure CPP  APIVP endtidal PCO2 Cerebral Function Monitor CFM activity and middle cerebral artery MCA flow velocity were measured Introduction of 1 isoflurane for a 10min period did not cause significant changes in IVP or MCA flow velocity but caused marked and significant reductions in arterial pressure and CPP and increases in CFM activity In five patients 2 isoflurane was administered for another 5 min before discontinuation of the isoflurane This caused further significant reduction in arterial pressure and increased IVP in four of the five patients The decrease in CPP was thus even greater than the reduction in arterial pressure and the CFM activity decreased in four out of five patients The MCA flow velocity did not change significantly
S876	To determine which test of islet function is the most sensitive indicator of subclinical betacell loss we studied six conscious dogs before and 1 and 6 wk after removal of the splenic and uncinate lobes 64  2 pancreatectomy PX To assess hyperglycemic potentiation acute insulin secretory responses AIR to 5 g iv arginine were measured at the fasting plasma glucose FPG level after PG was clamped at approximately 250 mgdl and after PG was clamped at a maximally potentiating level of 550650 mgdl FPG levels were unaffected by PX 112  4 mgdl prePX vs 115  5 mgdl 6 wk after PX P NS Similarly basal insulin levels remained constant after PX 11  2 microUml prePX vs 11  1 microUml 6 wk after PX P NS The AIR to 300 mgkg iv glucose decreased slightly from 42  9 microUml prePX to 32  5 microUml 6 wk after PX P NS and thus the betacell loss was underestimated In contrast insulin responses to arginine declined markedly after PX The AIR to arginine obtained at FPG levels declined from 23  3 microUml prePX to 13  2 microUml 6 wk after PX P  04 The AIR to arginine obtained at PG levels of approximately 250 mgdl declined even more from a prePX value of 56  7 microUml to 21  4 microUml 6 wk after PX P  02ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S877	Pulmonary function tests were evaluated in 28 Chinese patients with betathalassemia major receiving regular transfusions and desferoxamine and in 34 heightmatched normal Chinese children Comparison of lung function using analysis of covariance with reference to standing height showed that patients with thalassemia had a proportional decrease in forced vital capacity and forced expiratory flow volume in 1 second whereas their expiratory flow rates residual volume and total lung capacity were comparable to those in normal children The singlebreath carbon monoxide diffusion capacity was normal Our findings suggest that children with thalassemia major have mild restrictive lung disease The previous controversy regarding the presence of restrictive or obstructive lung disease in patients with thalassemia may be related to the use of inappropriate control values
S878	Case of isolated ACTH deficiency accompanied by hyperprolactinemia was reported Prolactin PRL secretory dynamics were evaluated by several stimulation thyrotropinreleasing hormone TRH sulpiride and suppression Ldopa tests Before glucocorticoid replacement therapy both TRH and sulpiride administration resulted in PRL hyperresponsiveness The sulpirideinduced PRL increase was higher than that induced by TRH Ldopa administration resulted in normal PRL suppression Following glucocorticoid replacement therapy the elevated basal PRL level returned to normal and PRL hyperresponsiveness to TRH or sulpiride also returned to normal These data suggest that the elevation of basal PRL level and PRL hyperresponsiveness observed in this patient is caused by glucocorticoid deficiency
S879	An infusion of propofol was compared with intravenous boluses of diazepam as sedation for minor oral surgery under local anaesthesia in 12 healthy patients who had elective bilateral surgical extraction of lower third molars the patients served as their own controls Plasma catecholamine vasopressin and cortisol concentrations were determined from repeated blood samples The total administered dose of propofol was 393 SD 134 mgkg and of diazepam 028 SD 007 mgkg No cardiovascular depression or airway problems occurred Other side effects were also rare but some discomfort on injection was frequent with propofol Recovery times were faster after propofol than after diazepam as assessed by the Maddox wing and visual analogue scales Propofol also provided better amnesia compared to diazepam at the time of the extraction of the teeth Eight of the 12 patients subjectively preferred propofol sedation There was no hormonal stress response in either group
S880	Stretching of 25gauge stainless steel wire causes alterations in the physical properties of the wire The yield strength and ultimate tensile strength are increased and the elasticity is decreased These alterations make stretched wire more satisfactory for maxillofacial surgical applications than unstretched wire
S881	Clinical and cytologic findings in 21 breast cancer patients with symptomatic pericardial effusion are presented The etiology of the pericardial effusion was definitely malignant by cytologyhistology in 13 patients 62 and suspected malignant by cytology in 2 patients 9 One patient 5 with definitely nonmalignant pericardial effusion by cytology was found to be histologically positive at autopsy In 5 patients 24 there was no histologicalcytological evidence of malignancy radiation pericarditis could be the etiology in 4 of these 5 patients The median time from the diagnosis of breast cancer to the development of symptomatic pericardial effusion was 60 months range 1219 months Ten patients developed cardiac tamponade they were treated by either pericardiocentesis or pericardiectomy The mean survival of patients with negative cytologyhistology was 12 months patients with suspicious cytology had a mean survival of 9 months patients with malignant effusion treated by pericardiectomy had a mean survival of 223 months while patients with malignant pericardial effusion who were not subjected to surgery had a mean survival of 47 months only It is concluded that the etiology of symptomatic pericardial effusion in breast cancer patients is not always malignant which emphasizes the role of fluid cytology in establishing definite diagnosis The survival probability is a function of the extent of extracardiac disease among patients with malignant pericardial effusion those selected for pericardiectomy have a longer than average survival
S882	Sixteen patients undergoing hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass for open heart surgery were studied prospectively Oxygen consumption and CO2 production showed a marked increase during the first 6 h postoperatively Consequently the measured resting energy expenditure was markedly elevated compared to the predicted energy expenditure This hypermetabolic response occurred simultaneously with maximum spontaneous rewarming after the end of surgical procedures Ventricular function was low throughout the postoperative period and no cardiac response to increased energy requirements was recorded On the contrary marked increases in arteriovenous oxygen and CO2 difference were observed during the period of highest resting energy expenditure We conclude that the first hours after hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass represent the period of highest risk for decompensation The continuous monitoring of CO2 production is suggested as a useful clinical method to detect postoperative changes in metabolic rate
S883	Tissue thromboplastin probably plays an important role in the development of posttraumatic pulmonary microembolism Infusion of purified human tissue thromboplastin in animals resulted in an intravascular coagulation and respiratory insufficiency This could be inhibited by previous infusion of phospholipase C PLC from Bacillus cereus We have studied the effects of PLC infusion on the course of posttraumatic pulmonary microembolism induced by a highenergy c 700 J missile trauma to the hind legs of pigs The trauma resulted in a major muscular injury and an indirect femoral fracture Untreated pigs developed intrapulmonary microemboli The degree of microembolism in the lungs was measured quantitatively by external detection over the right lung of radiolabeled platelets and fibrin Infusion of 80 micrograms PLCkghour resulted in an accumulation of blood PLC associated with toxic reaction leading to increasing tachycardia and circulatory collapse after 10 hours PLC infusion of 20 microgramskghour did not inhibit the pulmonary microembolism A PLCdose in between viz 4050 microgramskghour proved to efficiently inhibit most of the microembolism during the infusion period Cessation of PLC infusion after 24 hours was accompanied by a later increase in pulmonary trapping of platelets and fibrin and decreases in paO2 Concomitantly there were opacities seen on chest Xrays The results show that tissue thromboplastin is an important etiologic factor in posttraumatic pulmonary microembolism and that inhibition with phospholipase C can be of value in the prophylaxis of the syndrome
S884	alphaNeoendorphinlike immunoreactivities alphaNEIR were demonstrated in tissues from three patients with medullary carcinoma of the thyroid MCT A large amount of alphaNEIR was detected in the extracts of primary tumors and metastatic lymphatic tissues by a highly sensitive and specific radioimmunoassay RIA Gel filtration analyses showed two different molecularweight forms of the alphaNEIR One eluted at the void fraction and the other at the position of 125IalphaNE on Sephadex Pharmacia Fine Chemical Uppsala Sweden G50 chromatography Immunohistochemical examination revealed the presence of alphaNEIR in the Ccell carcinoma These data presumably reflect that alphaNE the opioid peptide derived from preproenkephalin B is synthesized in the MCT
S885	Believing that improved therapeutic results in cases of intracerebral hematoma might be obtained by minimal invasion of the brain we used computed tomographicguided stereotactic aspiration in 175 of 241 patients with putaminal hemorrhage These patients who were treated 6 or more hours after onset had hematomas larger than 8 ml and were unable to raise an arm andor leg on the affected side Craniotomy was performed in 15 other patients most of whom were brought to the hospital with large hematomas within 6 hours of onset The remaining patients either had mild deficits of consciousness 33 patients or severe deficits andor were elderly 18 patients and were treated conservatively Thirteen patients 74 showed rebleeding after stereotactic aspiration 6 instances of major and 7 instances of minor rebleeding Craniotomy and removal of the hematoma were required in three of these patients Aspiration should be avoided in patients who have a tendency for bleeding even if mild because rebleeding occurred in 6 of 23 such patients 26 in these study The consciousness level improved in 66 patients 38 was unchanged in 103 patients 59 and was worse in 6 patients 3 1 week postoperatively Motor function of the arm improved in 55 patients 31 and was worse in 23 patients 14 Six months after surgery the results for the 175 patients who underwent stereotactic aspiration were 19 excellent 32 good 35 fair 7 poor 6 dead and 1 unknown For the entire series of 241 patients the results were 24 excellent 26 good 31 fair 7 poor 11 dead and 1 unknownABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S886	The accuracy of five commercially available pulse oximeters was compared against arterial blood oxygen saturation under similar clinical conditions The oximeters had very similar performance in the clinically useful range of 80100 with a tendency slightly to underestimate the true saturation
S887	One weak link in synthetic ligament reconstruction of the knee is the fixation deviceligamentbone interface In this study a laboratory model using bovine calf bone was designed to evaluate six different fixation devices combined with either an unlooped ligament in different configurations or a looped ligament Results are expressed in terms of maximum load to failure elongation at the site of fixation stiffness of fixation prior to failure and mode of failure When failure of the test model occurred it was always at the ligamentfixation device interface the fixation devicebone interface or a combination of the two Elongation was recorded in all modes of fixation The most secure fixation was obtained with a cortical screw and a looped ligament the strength and predictability being mainly dependent on bone quality The least secure and least predictable fixation was obtained with a prototype called bucket wedge A barbed ligament staple and an unlooped ligament also had low predictability and considerably less strength than the screw fixation but showed less sensitivity to alterations in bone quality
S888	We examined longitudinal disability scores in 54 patients with Parkinsons disease followed for 6 years at UCLA We sorted data into 3 groups based on age at onset of symptoms group A onset under 50 years group B 50 to 59 years group C 60 years or older There were no significant differences between groups initially All 3 groups improved dramatically when levodopa was given but group A showed significantly less disability in years 4 5 and 6 than did group C The groups did not differ with respect to side effects To determine if age at onset affected mortality we sorted records from 4 geographically diverse centers into the same 3 groups Results on 359 patients followed for 3314 personyears covering a period of 17 years after onset of symptoms showed that group A had the most favorable observedtoexpected mortality ratio 182 compared with 217 and 220 for groups B and C respectively but the difference was not statistically significant Results from the disability analyses indicate that patients with onset of Parkinsons disease under 50 years of age may have a more favorable prognosis than those whose symptoms begin in later years
S889	The noninvasive measurement of vascular dynamics and elasticity is critical in understanding haemodynamic conditions of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and atherosclerosis Although there are numerous invasive and in vitro techniques for such measurements until now noninvasive methods have been limited We have now obtained stroboscopic NMR images of the carotid arteries of 80g rats The change in the crosssectional area of arteries of diameter approximately 600800 microns was correlated with the change in absolute blood pressure These are the first microimages of a dynamic system and enable the direct visualization of compliance the noninvasive measurement of Youngs modulus the direct determination of the local effects of vasoconstrictors and vasodilators and the mapping of the entire cardiac cycle
S890	The mediumterm performance of commercially available xenograft prostheses in the aortic position was evaluated in 198 patients operated upon since 1975 No associated procedures were performed in these patients in whom a variety of prostheses was employed The valve behaviour has been compared with other xenograft series homografts and synthetic prostheses There was a 55 hospital death rate and a 75 late mortality Five late deaths were valve related five were unrelated to the valve and four were of unknown cause but in elderly patients At eight years 861 of patients were alive the majority functionally improved Thromboembolic events were considerably fewer than those experienced with most nonbiological prostheses all but three events being transient Reoperation for primary valve dysfunction was a safe procedure but reoperation for infected prostheses carried a high mortality In comparing the aortic xenograft with other prostheses severe dysfunction was found to occur with similar frequency in all prostheses up to eight years and was rare Mild prosthetic dysfunction asymptomatic diastolic murmur occurs in about 25 of all tissue valves at eight years including the homograft The progression or otherwise of mild dysfunction has yet to be evaluated in currently available xenograft prostheses
S891	A patient with adultonset recurrent respiratory papillomatosis RRP initially diagnosed at age 28 years was treated with radiation therapy due to the rapid regrowth of lesions Following 6 years of apparently inhibited growth papilloma recurred and squamous carcinoma was diagnosed from a laryngeal biopsy A spontaneous laryngocutaneous fistula developed and laryngectomy was performed 14 years after irradiation The laryngectomy specimen was snap frozen and representative tissues were stored frozen for viral studies The larynx was wholeorgan sectioned for histologic examinations residual papilloma as well as carcinoma was observed Koilocytosis and other virusassociated histologic changes were also found HPV capsid antigen was present in papilloma carcinoma and clinically normal epithelium HPV nucleic acids conforming to HPV type 6 were present in keratin pearls and dysplastic cells According to prior reports carcinoma developing in preexisting papilloma arises from juvenileonset RRP Irradiated papilloma develop cancer at about 10 years and the patients rarely survive Nonirradiated cases develop cancer after 30 years and some develop papilloma in the hypopharynx and trachea but most patients survive Irradiation is not an obligatory precursor for malignant transformation of cancer however until now there have been no case reports of favorable outcome after irradiation of papilloma
S892	The integrated concentration of serum GH ICGH is used for the assessment of spontaneous GH secretion In order to use the ICGH as a diagnostic tool a normative reference range needs to be established We determined the ICGH by continuous blood withdrawal in 119 children of normal height weight and growth rate Although the mean ICGH increased with pubertal status 44  12 microgramsL at Tanner I n  36 55  21 microgramsL at Tanner IIIII n  43 and 58  16 at Tanner IVV n  40 P less than 003 there was a considerable overlap of individual ICGH levels between the pubertal groups Gender affected the mean ICGH level slightly but not the range Although the mean ICGH of girls tended to be higher than that of boys this difference was not statistically significant Ninety five percent of the ICGH values were above the 32 microgramsL level The response to pharmacological stimulation clonidine insulin or arginine was also evaluated in 68 of the subjects The peak GH response to pharmacological stimulation microgramsL with clonidine 210  107 n  66 was significantly higher than to either arginine 131  61 n  23 or insulin 142  63 n  19 P less than 001 The peak response to clonidine increased significantly with pubertal status P less than 0001 and there was an interactive effect of gender and pubertal stage where the GH response of prepubertal boys exceeded that of prepubertal girls but the response of pubertal girls exceeded that of pubertal boys P less than 002 The peak stimulated GH levels was correlated with ICGH in this subgroup r  052 P less than 00001 This study provides a large normative data base for ICGH and the GH provocative tests in normally growing children of varying pubertal status
S893	333 consecutive patients with hypopituitarism diagnosed between 1956 and 1987 were retrospectively examined The patients had been given routine replacement therapy The overall mortality was higher than in an age and sex matched population Deaths from vascular disorders were also significantly increased 60 40 male 20 female versus 308 expected 235 74 female The hazard function for vascular death was independent of age at diagnosis time after diagnosis calendar year of diagnosis gender degree of pituitary insufficiency hypertension and diabetes mellitus Mortality risk was raised irrespective of whether hypopituitarism was due to pituitary adenoma or secondary to other diseases 7 patients 3 male 4 female died from malignant diseases expected 101 and 41 respectively These observations indicate that life expectancy is shortened in patients with hypopituitarism Growthhormone deficiency could be a factor in this increased mortality from cardiovascular disease
S894	Cerebrospinal fluid CSF samples from 84 patients with confirmed or suspected diseases of the central nervous system were studied with hydrogen1 magnetic resonance MR spectroscopy In 19 of the patients clinical chemical tests of the CSF indicated normal protein contents and normal quantities of cells these samples were used as controls Preliminary results indicate that tumors may be reflected in the MR spectra of CSF disk herniations could not be distinguished on the basis of the MR spectral characteristics
S895	The brachial plexus tension test BPTT appears to offer a means of examining the extensibility and mechanosensitivity of the neural tissues related to an upper limb This test was used to evaluate possible cervical or brachial plexus neural involvement causing arm pain syndromes in 37 patients presenting for assessment following neck injury in motor vehicle accidents The BPTT was considered positive in 55 of the 61 symptomatic arms There were no falsepositive responses in the 13 asymptomatic arms although a slight loss of extensibility was evident in five arms Twenty patients without clinical evidence of current or previous neck pathology were similarly examined There were no reports of pain on BPTT in this group In 36 of the 40 arms a full range of extensibility was present In the other four arms the loss of extensibility was slight This study suggests that arm pain and paraesthesiae which follow neck injury in motor vehicle accidents arise from irritable cervical neural tissues The study also highlights the persistent nature and widespread distribution of the pain in these patients
S896	The binding of peanut PNA and wheat germ WGA lectins to tissue sections was examined in biopsy specimens from normal urothelium ten patients and from tumor tissue of noninvasive 17 patients and invasive bladder 31 patients carcinomas The results were correlated to DNA content histopathologic grade and the presence or absence of invasion Significant alterations in lectin binding associated with the development of cancer were found A gradual loss of both PNA and WGA binding was found to correlate with higher grades of atypia P less than 0001 The loss of WGA binding was significantly correlated with both tumor aneuploidy P less than 0001 and the presence of invasion P less than 005 whereas no significant correlation was found between loss of PNA binding and these variables We concluded that the loss of WGA binding structures associated with bladder cancer shows a better correlation with known risk factors aneuploidy and invasion than the loss of PNA binding does
S897	Two patients experienced severe brain swelling during the evacuation of acute subdural hematomas Postoperative computed tomographic CT scans revealed delayed extradural hematomas on the sides opposite the subdural hematomas Extradural bleeding occurred in the area of the fractured skull One patient improved neurologically after evacuation of the extradural hematoma and the other was not operated because he was moribund Drilling exploratory burr holes in the fractured area may have been a better strategy than awaiting a postoperative CT scan The reduction of intracranial pressure after the removal of subdural hematoma was postulated to be the most important factor contributing to the formation of the extradural hematoma
S898	Several investigators have reported decreased natural killer cell activity of the peripheral blood from children with acute leukemia both at diagnosis and in relapse This study was to determine whether this decreased natural killer activity is the result of a diminished number or defective function of natural killer cells or both The percentage of Leu 19 NKH1 CD56 and the lytic activity of a purified Leu 19 population from the peripheral blood of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia as well as from healthy children were determined This cell population mediates most natural killer and natural killerlike activity in the peripheral blood Twentythree children with acute lymphocytic leukemia 16 at diagnosis seven in relapse as well as six control children were studied The percentage of Leu 19 cells was significantly lower in the blood of children either at initial diagnosis median 3 P less than 0005 or in relapse median 1 P less than 001 than that for the control children median 125 The cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC against K562 in 3hour 51Cr release assay was significantly lower for patients either at diagnosis median 85 lytic unitsLU107 cells P less than 0005 or in relapse median 3 LU107 cells P less than 0005 than that for normal controls median 97 LU107 cells The lytic activity of a fluorescent activated cell sorter FACS purified Leu 19 population was evaluated The Leu 19 cells were sorted from PBMC of 11 children with acute lymphocytic leukemia who had more than 2 Leu 19 cells in their PBMC nine at diagnosis and two in relapse The lytic activity of sorted Leu 19 cells was significantly P less than 004 lower for patients at initial diagnosis median 45 LU107 cells than that for normal control children median 317 LU107 cells One of the two children studied at relapse had low Leu 19 lytic activity The authors concluded that 1 The percentage of Leu 19 cells in the peripheral blood of the majority of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia either at diagnosis or in relapse is below normal 2 The lytic activity of PBMC from the majority of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia is reduced both at diagnosis and in relapse and 3 The lytic activity of Leu 19 purified PBMC is reduced in the majority of children with acute lymphocytic leukemia These findings confirm the defective natural killer cell profile in children with acute lymphocytic leukemia both at the time of diagnosis and in relapse
S899	Four monoclonal antibodies reactive by immunofluorescence and by flow microfluorimetry with canine and porcine gastric parietal cell membranes were produced by fusion of mouse NS1 myeloma cells with splenocytes from mice immunized with a population of canine gastric mucosal cells containing 6070 parietal cells One of these an IgM antibody designated 2C1 reacted with the surface membranes of parietal cells by immunofluorescence flow microfluorimetry and immunogold electron microscopy competed with 125Ilabeled gastrin for binding to gastric cells and inhibited by 56 maximal gastrin stimulation of 14Caminopyrine uptake in parietal cells The antibody immunoprecipitated 125Ilabeled samples of a 78kDa gastrinbinding protein purified from membrane extracts of porcine gastrin mucosa but did not recognize the same protein labeled covalently with 125Ilabeled gastrin217hexadecapeptide These observations suggest that the previously identified 78kDa gastrinbinding protein is the gastrin receptor and that the antibody 2C1 is directed against the gastrin binding site of the gastrin receptor
S900	Postoperative discitis POD continues to be a diagnostic challenge and its management remains variable This article raises the following questions and presents new observations What is the current role of the CT scan in POD Is a uniform pathogen involved and is there a basis for the duration of intravenous antibiotics What is the expected longterm functional result In a retrospective analysis of 12 consecutive patients with POD followed for an average of 29 months 1742 months the CT scan was extremely sensitive in showing a pathogen was present The CT scan was misread in over onethird of the cases Grampositive cocci were the only organisms cultured 10 of 13 cultures 8 of 12 patients The erythrocyte sedimentation rate ESR invariably fell predictably to normal within 90 days when patients were treated with IV antibiotics for more than 40 days Most patients were clinically improved and subjectively better at followup examination No correlation existed between the patients subjective result and preexisting medical conditions the type of antibiotic or the length of treatment the ESR or the followup roentgenograms
S901	This study screened 1986 ADA annual session participants for interdental gingival inflammation by using the Eastman Interdental Bleeding Index EIBI The EIBI provides a sensitive and objective measure of interdental gingival inflammation and has been shown to be reliable At least one bleeding site was found in 81 of the 435 dentists examined This study showed that in a dental population the prevalence of gingival inflammation was high when the health of interdental tissues was assessed
S902	The authors describe the abnormalities of gonadal function developing in a patient with prostate cancer who had received estrogen therapy continuously for 6 years The pretreatment prostate biopsy showed well developed acini consistent with normal androgenization and adenocarcinoma Twelve years later 6 years after discontinuation of estrogen treatment the patient presented with severe hypogonadism gynecomastia and primary hypothyroidism Testicular biopsies showed ghosts of seminiferous tubules with absence of Leydig cells and prostatic biopsies showed atrophic acini without evidence of malignancy Despite undetectable serum testosterone levels serum gonadotropins were inappropriately normal and responded minimally to gonadotropinreleasing hormone GnRH administration Replacement therapy with levothyroxine did not correct gonadal dysfunction Thus prolonged estrogen therapy may result in irreversible testicular destruction and loss of the feedback response of the hypothalamic pituitary gonadal axis
S903	The type of acidemia umbilical arterial pH less than 72 occurring in newborns with secondstage baseline fetal heart rate FHR abnormalities was evaluated in 277 term gestations Umbilical arterial acidemia occurred in 40 of the neonates with moderate to severe bradycardia 25 of 63 in 30 with mild bradycardia 16 of 53 and in 22 with tachycardia seven of 32 compared with only 6 eight of 129 of those with a normal FHR P less than 05 in each of the three comparisons The majority 31 of 56 55 of the acidemic neonates had a mixed respiratorymetabolic pattern whereas 13 of 56 23 had a respiratory pattern and 12 of 56 21 had a metabolic pattern The mean umbilical arterial buffer deficit mEqL was significantly greater P less than 0005 in newborns with metabolic acidemia 159  28 than in those with either mixed 96  25 or respiratory 64  19 acidemia We conclude that baseline secondstage FHR abnormalities can predict which newborns are at increased risk of having umbilical arterial pH below 72 at birth Selective determination of umbilical arterial pH and blood gas analysis may be useful in assessing intrapartum management retrospectively
S904	We prepared a prosthesis for the replacement of the lumbar vertebrae of sheep using apatite and wollastonitecontaining glassceramic The material is stronger than human cortical bone and has the special feature of chemical bonding to bone Ten sheep underwent replacement of L3 and L4 vertebrae without bone grafting The animals were killed at intervals from three months to 27 months after operation and the interface between the prosthesis and bone was examined radiologically histologically and crystallographically Bone bonding with the prosthesis had occurred in half the implants It took at least one year for bonding to be complete but an apatite layer on the surface of the prosthesis was observed as early as three months after the operation suggesting the possibility of much earlier bone bonding if more rigid fixation of the prosthesis had been provided
S905	Questionnaire responses from 120 men and 337 women over the age of 50 years were studied to determine the prevalence of back pain among the elderly In order to gain a rough indication of the back pain among elderly women which might be due to osteoporosis the prevalence was compared in the two sexes The prevalence of back pain without radiation to the legs and concomitant morbidity was found to be similar among men and women up to the 7079year agegroup After this age the prevalence was higher in women Those with exceptional loss of body height or kyphosis had a high prevalence of back pain while those who had sustained previous hip or radius fractures did not There was increasing prevalence of back pain among women with increasing number of previous fractures The study gives little indication of serious morbidity of osteoporosis in the form of back pain before very old age
S906	Two hundred twenty patients who underwent a radical cystectomy and en bloc pelvic lymph node dissection with urinary diversion were reviewed to define the incidence of upper tract carcinoma developing after cystectomy Each patient was followed for at least five years or until death In 5 of 220 24 upper tract lesions developed with a diseasefree interval from cystectomy of twentytwo to fiftyfour months All patients died within two to twentyseven months of diagnosis Common pathologic features included the presence of highgrade multifocal lesions or carcinoma in situ CIS in the cystectomy specimen tumor invasion of the intramural ureter and positive findings on urethrectomy specimens Although the incidence of this disease process is low heightened surveillance of the upper urinary tracts would seem appropriate in patients displaying these pathologic features
S907	Fiftytwo patients with malignant hypercalcemia were treated with a single dose of 3amino1hydroxypropylidene11 bisphosphonate AHPrBP previously APD a potent inhibitor of osteoclastmediated bone resorption In order to establish a doseresponse in humans patients were divided into four groups receiving 30 mg 45 mg 60 mg or 90 mg respectively as a 24hour infusion Initial plasma calcium was similar in all groups except in the group receiving 90 mg of which some patients had higher initial values All patients responded to AHPrBP with a rapid decrease of plasma calcium concentration from 347  010 mmolL at day 0 to 243  006 at day 6 P less than 001 Plasma calcium became normal within four to six days in 43 patients Eight of the nine patients whose calcium did not become normal were in the lowdose 30 and 45 mg of AHPrBP groups Slight and asymptomatic hypocalcemia occurred in only tow of the 26 patients in the lowdose groups but in six of the 26 patients in the highdose groups A followup study in 40 patients showed that hypercalcemia recurred within 1 month in five of ten patients in the group receiving 30 mg in three of ten patients in the group receiving 45 mg and in one of 20 patients in the groups receiving 60 and 90 mg whereas mortality was almost identical in all four groups In all groups plasma phosphate plasma creatinine urinary calcium and hydroxyproline excretion decreased significantly In conclusion when administered as a singleday infusion in the treatment of tumor hypercalcemia AHPrBP leads to a dosedependent decrease in plasma calcium To prevent transient hypocalcemia and early relapse the optimal dose should be adapted to the degree of severity of hypercalcemia
S908	Systemic and carotid hemodynamics were studied in 10 healthy male volunteers before and after shortterm administration of a 4 mg dose of the calcium entryblocker lacidipine in a placebocontrolled doubleblind crossover study Hemodynamic parameters of the right common carotid artery were measured before and at 1 12 and 3 hours after dose administration by means of pulsed Doppler flowmetry In addition systemic hemodynamic parameters were calculated from cardiac impedance measurements at the same time In comparison with placebo lacidipine produced a significant decrease in blood pressure together with systemic and carotid arteriolar dilatation Heart rate increased sharply whereas carotid arterial diameter and tangential tension did not change The study provided evidence that the calcium entryblocker lacidipine produces systemic and carotid arteriolar vasodilation and that the heart rate baroreflex response after administration of calcium inhibitor is not associated with a significant modification of the geometry of carotid arterial wall
S909	This prospective study compared images obtained with a photostimulable imaging plate with matched images obtained with a conventional screenfilm combination in 26 patients undergoing intraoperative arteriography Diagnostic accuracy of the two techniques was assessed objectively and image quality was assessed subjectively In 16 patients 62 the radiation exposure was reduced by 50 for the imaging plate technique by decreasing the mAs level generally used for the screenfilm combination Because of the dynamic range of the imaging plate system no repeat examinations were necessary while 12 of the screenfilm studies had to be repeated because of over or underpenetration Imaging plate studies required 6 more time for processing than screenfilm studies Receiveroperatingcharacteristic analysis indicated no difference in diagnostic accuracy between the two imaging techniques Subjective evaluation also revealed no difference in observer preference for imaging plate or screenfilm studies The imaging plate technique is an excellent alternative to screenfilm studies in the operating room
S910	During percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left anterior descending artery in two patients although the artery could be initially dilated the vessel would not remain patent despite numerous redilations and pharmacological maneuvers A third patient developed total occlusion of the right coronary artery during diagnostic catheterization In these patients the presence of a guide wire across the occlusion provided patency and stability With the guide wire in place the patients were taken to the operating room without further chest pain or evidence of ischemia
S911	A 12yearold boy with a short history of dyspnea and occasional leftsided chest pain was discovered to have a diaphragmatic hernia that apparently resulted from minor chest trauma two years earlier A large portion of the small bowel part of the transverse colon and the entire omentum were found in the left side of the chest The patient recovered uneventfully after primary repair of the diaphragm Although such lesions are usually associated with relatively severe injuries this case shows that they may result from any type of chest trauma
S912	There is only one previous report of an estrogensecreting adrenal tumor occurring in a woman during reproductive years Our patient presented with mild hirsutism associated with menstrual bleeding every 36 weeks The occurrence of apparently intermenstrual bleeding prompted an evaluation of estrogen levels Markedly elevated plasma estrone levels were found 8602305 pmolL normal 50340 Lesser relative elevations in 11deoxycortisol and androstenedione were noted Computed tomographic scanning of the adrenal glands identified a large tumor which was subsequently resected Estrone levels fell to 120 pmolL and all other abnormalities were corrected Eighteen months after adrenalectomy ovulation occurred regularly and steroid levels were entirely normal Steroid production in a cell suspension made from tissue obtained from the 190g tumor was compared with that occurring in normal human adrenal cells The production of estrone by the tumor cells was 40fold greater than that by normal adrenal cells There was also a mild excess of 11deoxycortisol produced by tumor cells but the tumor cells were less than 50 as efficient as normal cells in producing cortisol dehydroepiandrosterone androstenedione testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate Examination of the steroid profile in plasma occurring in three other patients with adrenal tumors reveals that while elevations in estrone occur frequently this is usually due to the peripheral conversion of very high levels of androstenedione Estrone androstenedione and 11deoxycortisol plasma levels were elevated in all four patients dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was elevated in only two of four patients After resection of one of these tumors all steroid levels remained normal despite the occurrence of extensive metastases These observations confirm the difficulty of making a diagnosis of estrogen excess in a woman during reproductive years because of the paucity of physical signs The acquisition of aromatase activity was clearly demonstrated by tumor cells from our patient in vitro Elevated plasma concentrations of estrone androstenedione and 11deoxycortisol provide useful markers for adrenal tumors but no one steroid can be relied upon in all tumors and metastases may lack the steroidogenic capabilities of the primary tumor
S913	The potential effects of dietary glutathione on the metabolism of peroxidized lipid ingested in the diet were studied using everted sacs of rat small intestine and peroxidized methyl linoleate Peroxidized methyl linoleate was added to the luminal side and the appearance of thiobarbituric acidreactive TBAreactive material on the contraluminal side was measured Incubation with NNbis2chloroethylNnitrosourea BCNU under conditions in which it inhibits the glutathione disulfide reductaseglutathione peroxidase system increased the appearance of TBAreactive material indicating that at least a portion of the TBAreactive material passing through the epithelium is peroxide in nature Adding glutathione GSH to the luminal side substantially decreased the appearance of TBAreactive material on the contraluminal side either without or with BCNU treatment Inhibition of GSH transport and control experiments with GSH peroxidized methyl linoleate and purified brush border membranes showed that this decrease was due primarily to uptake of luminal GSH and its use to support intracellular GSHdependent reactions Thus the results indicate that exogenous GSH which can exist in certain diets can be taken up by the small intestine and used to protect against absorption of lipid peroxidation products
S914	We report two siblings with 46XX hermaphroditism in whom we were unable to show the presence of Y specific DNA sequences using the DNA probes Y190 GMGY7 pHY21 pDP34 and 27a We conclude that an autosomal or X chromosome gene mutation is the most likely mechanism of inheritance in this family with 46XX hermaphroditism
S915	Concentrations of interleukin 1beta and tumor necrosis factor in cerebrospinal fluid CSF of 42 neonates with Gramnegative enteric bacillary meningitis were determined and correlated with outcome and other CSF indices At the time of diagnosis interleukin 1beta was detected in CSF of 40 infants and peak concentrations correlated significantly with outcome from disease Days of interleukin 1beta concentrations of greater than 200 pgml or greater than or equal to 20 pgml were significantly correlated with days that CSF cultures were positive and that K1 antigen and endotoxin were detected in CSF Tumor necrosis factor activity was detected in CSF of 25 of 27 infants there was no correlation between outcome and CSF tumor necrosis factor concentrations The results provide a possible rationale for therapeutic intervention to improve outcome
S916	The NK11 mouse was constructed by weekly injections of monoclonal antiNK11 antibody from birth through adulthood Spleen cells from these mice have decreased NK11 cells and null Thy1 and B220 cells Their splenic NK activity to YAC targets was low and was not enhanced by IFNalpha or IFNbeta Bone marrow BM of these NK11 mice have normal precursors to NK cells 1 NK activity could be generated from NK11 BM cells cultured in rIL 2 for 5 to 6 days These cultured BM cells expressed Qa5 Thy1 AsGm1 and NK11 antigens The precursor cells of these BM cytotoxic cells are NK11 2 transfer of BM cells from the NK11 mice reconstituted the NK activity of irradiated NKdepleted recipients Lymphokineactivated killer cells could also be generated from spleens of these NK11 mice Therefore the NK11 mice were specifically depleted of mature cytotoxic NK cells but not the NK11 precursors of NK cells This mouse model is valuable to study ontogeny and physiologic relevance of NK cells
S917	Fat embolism after bilateral total knee arthroplasty TKA occurred in 12 of the authors patients having bilateral TKA with intramedullary instrumentation Usually embolism was manifested as neurologic changes most often changes of mental status Death is a potential consequence and this occurred in one patient The present authors believe that fat embolism is not predictable preoperatively and propose that intraoperative guidelines can be used to reduce risk of this complication Intraoperative monitoring by a SwanGanz catheter will permit measurement of the pulmonary arterial pressure pulmonary vascular resistance and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure A sustained rise of any of these would be an indication to abort the second knee operation If SwanGanz catheter is not available a sustained fall of oxygen saturation to 90 or lower can be used as a criterion The risk for fat embolism is increased with the use of intramedullary instrumentation and the above guidelines are recommended for operations with this type of instrumentation A fluted intramedullary rod and vent holes should be used
S918	We investigated paraffinembedded brain sections from 41 patients with CreutzfeldtJakob disease CJD and from 9 with GerstmannStraussler syndrome GSS using antihuman prion protein PrP antisera antiGSS kuru plaque cores and antiPrP synthetic peptide and antibeta protein antiserum The antihuman PrP antiserum reacted with the plaques in CJD and GSS with or without degenerative neurites neuritic components In addition the antibeta protein antiserum immunolabeled kuru plaquelike compact plaques in some cases of CJD Therefore previous morphological classifications of the plaques may not always be valid Senile plaques labeled with antibeta protein antiserum were evident in 65 of the CJD brains and 50 of GSS brains from patients in their 60s and in 73 of brains from CJD patients in their 70s but not in brains from patients under 60 years of age The incidence of the senile plaques was compatible with the normal aging process and was apparently not accelerated by the disease process of CJD or GSS These immunostaining approaches using antihuman PrP and antibeta protein antisera allow classification of plaque types and increase the reliability of the pathological diagnosis in persons with dementia
S919	On a number of occasions there have been descriptions of epidemic achlorhydria in subjects undergoing repeated gastric secretory studies typically as part of research protocols We observed a case in a 37yrold healthy man undergoing weekly gastric analyses along with endoscopy and gastric biopsy as part of a research protocol studying gastric adaptation to aspirin In the middle of the 2nd wk of aspirin administration he developed severe nausea and epigastric discomfort Aspirin administration was discontinued but as per protocol gastric analyses endoscopies and biopsies were continued Compared to the week preceding the acute illness biochemical analyses showed a transient 74fold increase in basal gastric acid 36fold increase in pepsin secretion 88fold increase in DNA loss 56fold increase in mucus secretion and 12fold increase in gastric bleeding Basal acid secretion was zero and pepsin secretion was onethird of control during the 2nd wk of the infection Endoscopy at the time of symptoms showed erosions in the gastric body and antrum as well as numerous mucosal hemorrhages and an acute ulcer in the antrum Endoscopy 7 days later revealed that the gastric mucosa had almost completely recovered with only a shallow erosion seen at the site of the previous ulcer Gastric biopsies were normal before and during the first 2 wk of aspirin ingestion Gastric biopsies taken at the time of the acute illness associated with increased basal acid secretion showed marked acute inflammation of the antrum with many Campylobacter pylori bacilli At that time neither acute inflammation nor C pylori were found in biopsies from the body of the stomach Biopsies obtained 1 wk later zero basal acid showed acute inflammation of both the gastric body and antrum One week later biopsies from the gastric body showed mild focal acute inflammation moderate chronic inflammation and an occasional lymphoid follicle the gastric antrum showed chronic inflammation Antral biopsies obtained 2 yr later showed persistent chronic gastritis with prominent lymphoid follicles and scattered foci of acute inflammatory cells C pylori bacilli were still present but were less apparent We believe that the syndrome of acute epidemic gastritis is often iatrogenic C pylori infection Our case shows that increased basal acid and pepsin secretion occur before onset of basal acid hypochlorhydria in the acute phase of C pylori infection
S920	4 strips of 5 Epiquick patch tests 19 allergens plus 1 control were applied symmetrically in duplicate on the left and right sides of the upper back in 100 consecutive patients 70 positive allergic patch test reactions were recorded on the left side and 67 on the right side 67 positive reactions were concordant on both sides 64 with the same score of intensity and 3 with a different score 3 positive reactions in 2 patients on the left side were negative on the right side 1 TMTD 1 cobalt chloride and 1 wool alcohols At rechallenge 6 weeks later they were positive No explanation could be found for negative results at the first challenge on one side and not on the other The rate of nonreproducible positive results to the overall number of positive reactions was 42 The good reproducibility rate 958 provides useful information for further comparative studies
S921	Infection of the genital tract by HPV is a sexually transmitted disease of increasing prevalence The association of HPV infection with genital tract malignancies is of great concern and further studies are needed to clarify this association Few investigators believe at this time that proof of a direct causative role exists for HPV in these cancers but indirect evidence of such a role is abundant There are many clinical forms of HPV infection of the genital tract and few clinicians can easily recognize them all Treatment of condyloma acuminatum is difficult and frustrating Cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is the safest and most effective therapy for most forms of condyloma acuminatum Recurrence of condyloma acuminatum is common with all presently used forms of therapy probably owing to latent HPV infection in normalappearing skin No form of treatment is ideal for all forms of condyloma acuminatum but without continued efforts to find better therapeutic modalities and preventative measures the epidemic of genital HPV infection will continue unchecked
S922	Proteoglycan levels were measured in a series of synovial fluid samples from patients with acute and chronic joint diseases using a modified chemical dye binding method Levels found in 50 miscellaneous inflammatory arthritis fluids mean  1732  909 microgramsml were higher than found in either 50 with rheumatoid arthritis 963  313 microgramsml or 50 with osteoarthritis 838  273 microgramsml For comparison proteoglycan levels were measured in 15 cadaver synovial fluids 989  442 microgramsml and 12 synovial fluids from patients with sports injury 1637  794 microgramsml Patients were recruited into a trial where synovial fluid was aspirated as often as possible over a 6month period during which the patients were followed using a number of well proven clinical parameters No correlation was found between the degree of joint destruction as measured by Xray damage and the concentration or total amount of proteoglycan in the synovial fluid In addition there was no correlation between the level or total amount of proteoglycan and any clinical parameter of disease activity
S923	Colloidal bismuth subcitrate CBS DeNol exhibits gastroprotective properties in experimental animals and enhances the healing of chronic gastroduodenal ulcers but the mechanisms of these actions have not been entirely elucidated The present study was designed to determine whether epidermal growth factor EGF which also has gastroprotective and ulcer healing properties contributes to the action of DeNol on the stomach in rats It was found that DeNol protects the gastric mucosa against ethanol damage and that this is accompanied by increased mucosal generation of prostaglandins PG Removal of the endogenous source of EGF sialoadenectomy did not significantly decrease the protective and PG stimulating effects of DeNol Pretreatment with exogenous EGF partially protected the stomach against ethanol injury but did not influence the protective action of DeNol in sialoadenectomised animals DeNol like EGF given orally enhanced the healing of chronic gastric and duodenal ulcers induced by serosal acetic acid DeNol was found to bind EGF in a pHdependent manner and to accumulate it in ulcer area Thus the peptide is available locally in high concentrations to accelerate the reepithelialisation and tissue repair of the ulcerated mucosa These ulcer healing effects of DeNol were reduced by sialoadenectomy and restored in part by oral administration of EGF We conclude that salivary glands in rats are not essential for the gastroprotection induced by DeNol but seem to play an important role in the ulcer healing action of this drug possibly via an EGF mediated mechanism
S924	Analysis of the requirements for information management in the various segments of the health care delivery system indicates that the needs of the various user groups overlap arguing that an integrated information system should be shared between groups Trends in health care policy suggest that the health care database should be global in scope not limited to one health care facility The design of an integrated health care information system that permits local autonomy requires a new approach to systems architecture
S925	Mastectomy was dictated by medical considerations in about 40 of 424 consecutive patients who had invasive breast cancer with no evidence of systemic metastases Half of the women considered suitable for local excision of the breast cancer followed by radiotherapy conservation elected to have mastectomy and intraoperative findings dictated mastectomy in about 20 of those electing conservation Consequently conservation was accomplished in about one quarter of those treated for breast cancer Younger rather than older women more frequently expressed the desire for breast conservation
S926	There are three ways in which studentstudent interaction may be organized for nutrition education Of the three cooperation is the only instructional strategy congruent with the goals of nutrition education The essential elements of cooperative learning and the specific actions teachers need to take to implement it are presented When cooperative learning is implemented effectively longterm modifications of nutrition knowledge attitudes and behavior result Nutrition education classes will more successfully fulfill their purposes when cooperative learning is primarily used
S927	Tumordraining lymph node cells from mice bearing the methylcholanthreneinduced MCA 106 tumors can be sensitized in vitro to acquire antitumor reactivity We examined the effect of interferon alfa on the function of cells that underwent in vitro sensitization in adoptive immunotherapy Interferon alfa increased the antitumor reactivity of in vitro sensitized cells in the treatment of MCA 106 pulmonary metastases This effect was evident in irradiated mice indicating that a host response to the interferon alfa was not required Interferon alfa treatment increased class I major histocompatibility complex antigen expression on tumor cells and increased their susceptibility to lysis by in vitro sensitized cells These results suggest that interferon alfa enhancement of adoptive immunotherapy was mediated by its effect on tumor cells Interferon alfa may be a useful adjunct to the adoptive immunotherapy of human cancer
S928	Both kallikrein and plasmin readily released 112000 and 102000 molecular weight derivatives from purified human high molecular weight HMWkininogen In each instance these early digestion products were composed of disulfidelinked chains of 64000 and 58000 molecular weights Under the experimental conditions used kallikrein failed to release additional cleavage fragments from HMWkininogen when it had been previously digested by plasmin whereas HMWkininogen pretreated with kallikrein was then cleaved by plasmin into several derivatives of decreasing molecular size The profound molecular changes induced by plasmin were only accompanied by partial kinin release Plasmin cleavage dissociated procoagulant activity from at least one antigenic site of HMWkininogen light chain Moreover kinin activity could be released from a cleavage product of HMWkininogen containing light but not heavy chain antigens indicating that plasmin had cleaved this kininogen on the Nterminal side of the bradykinin region of the molecule Cleavage of HMWkininogen by kallikrein readily released bradykinin whereas kinin release by plasmin was slower and the cleavage pattern different It is therefore unlikely that plasmin is a major source of bradykinin release in plasma A method of isolating HMWkininogen from human plasma is described that provides a homogeneous single band of kininogen with a recovery of approximately 44 with respect to that in plasma in a period of 5 days
S929	To evaluate the roles of plasminogen activator PA and PA inhibitor PAI in human ovulation we obtained follicular fluid and granulosa cells from individual preovulatory follicles of patients undergoing gamete intrafallopian tube transfer The follicular fluid samples n  25 were analyzed for total tissuetype PA antigen PA enzyme activity by fibrin autography PAI activity PAI type 1 PAI1 antigen and PAI1 mRNA The follicular fluid of preovulatory follicles contained low levels of total tissuetype PA antigen less than 1 ngmL Fibrin autography experiments indicated little or no detectable PA activity associated with free or unbound PA The results of the PAI activity assay and PAI1 antigen determination support the concept of a relative abundance of PAI compared with PA Hybridization analysis was used to measure the relative amounts of granulosa cell PAI1 mRNA The levels of PAI1 mRNA correlate with follicular fluid PAI concentrations in individual follicles Taken together these results support the idea that there is very little free or active PA in follicular fluid of human preovulatory follicles but there is an abundance of PAI Furthermore PAI1 produced by the granulosa cells may represent a major form of PAI in follicular fluid
S930	The behindtheback reach test is a reproducible and reliable physical fitness test for musculoskeletal extensibility of the upper extremities shoulder girdles and upper back Requiring only a rigid ruler and marking pen administration of this test can be learned easily both by medical and nonmedical personnel Normative data derived from a study of healthy subjects of different ages demonstrated that extensibility decreases with age Moreover musculoskeletal extensibility for women was significantly greater than that for men The test results were not influenced significantly by anthropometric measurements
S931	Fortyfive consecutive patients 32 women and 13 men underwent biopsy of the temporal artery because of suspected giant cell arteritis Their ages ranged from 38 to 84 years mean 681 years Five patients 111 four of them women were found to be affected by the disease Their ages ranged from 54 to 80 years mean 69 years Clinical and laboratory findings included elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate prolonged fever continuous headache sudden onset of unilateral blindness intermittent mandibular claudication severe anemia and myalgia None of these whether present in isolation or in various combinations were of significant diagnostic value All biopsies were examined both by light microscopy and by scanning electron microscopy The former examination took about 57 days to complete and the latter about 3 hours Light microscopy studies showed that 466 of the arterial biopsies were normal 423 were arteriosclerotic and 111 5 specimens were characteristic of giant cell arteritis Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the biopsies obtained from all five patients found to have temporal arteritis displayed the occlusive pattern the threelaminar appearance of the artery was markedly distorted or lost the internal elastic lamina was barely detectable and the densely hypertrophied media and intima filled the arterial lumen virtually obliterating it We conclude that scanning electron microscopy is a quick and accurate procedure for diagnosis of temporal arteritis and that positive findings may be taken as an indication for immediate steroid treatment
S932	To determine the interactions of phenylalanine and tryptophan with gastric secretagogues acid secretory studies were performed in 10 healthy subjects Phenylalanine and tryptophan potentiated the gastric secretory responses following low doses of pentagastrin whereas their effects on acid secretion stimulated by low doses of histamine or the cholinergic bethanecol were additive Phenylalanine and tryptophan did not increase maximal acid output stimulated by pentagastrin histamine or bethanecol Doses of the H2receptor antagonist ranitidine the prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol atropine and somatostatin that produced approximately 50 inhibition of pentagastrinstimulated acid secretion significantly inhibited phenylalanine and tryptophanstimulated acid secretion After the combination of either phenylalanine or tryptophan with pentagastrin the H2receptor antagonist significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion whereas somatostatin atropine and the prostaglandin E1 analogue were not effective These results indicate that both phenylalanine and tryptophan potentiate gastric acid secretion stimulated by a submaximal dose of pentagastrin whereas their effects on histamine and bethanecolstimulated secretion are additive The potentiating effects of phenylalanine and tryptophan on pentagastrinstimulated acid secretion depend at least in part on intact histamine pathways
S933	Lowstringency hybridization with human glucocorticoid receptor hGR complementary DNA was used to isolate a new gene encoding a predicted 107kilodalton polypeptide Expression studies demonstrate its ability to bind aldosterone with high affinity and to activate gene transcription in response to aldosterone thus establishing its identity as the human mineralocorticoid receptor hMR This molecule also shows high affinity for glucocorticoids and stimulates a glucocorticoidresponsive promoter Together the hMR and hGR provide unexpected functional diversity in which hormonebinding properties target gene interactions and patterns of tissuespecific expression may be used in a combinatorial fashion to achieve complex physiologic control
S934	Populations of alveolar macrophages recovered from the lower respiratory tract secrete fibronectin a multifunctional glycoprotein capable of influencing cell migration attachment differentiation and proliferation Using in situ hybridization of 35Slabeled antisense and sense RNA fibronectin probes the present study demonstrates that most but not all normal alveolar macrophages contain fibronectin mRNA transcripts and that among those macrophages expressing this gene the relative amount of fibronectin mRNA transcripts varies from cell to cell Interestingly while 66  3 of normal alveolar macrophages contain fibronectin mRNA transcripts this is increased to 82  2 P less than 001 of alveolar macrophages recovered from the lungs of individuals with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis IPF a chronic inflammatory disorder associated with exaggerated amounts of fibronectin in the lower respiratory tract Furthermore of the macrophages expressing the fibronectin gene those from IPF patients contain more fibronectin mRNA transcripts than those from normals Consistent with this observation evaluation of tissue samples from IPF patients demonstrated that of all cells present alveolar macrophages showed the greatest numbers of fibronectin mRNA transcripts per cell These observations demonstrate that there can be marked celltocell variation in the expression of the gene for a macrophage product such as fibronectin suggesting that there are processes that modulate similar cells in the same anatomic compartment to vary their expression of the same gene
S935	We report the observation of a high neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity MPXI in patients with megaloblastic anemia MPXI is rapidly measured as part of an automated complete blood count Technicon H1 Technicon Instruments Corp Tarrytown NY We describe the range of MPXI levels in healthy and patient populations and in 10 cases of megaloblastic anemia including five having elevated mean cell volume MCV and five without macrocytosis Regardless of the MCV our megaloblastic patients had hypersegmented neutrophils and elevated MPXI levels without visible alteration of granule content MPXI measurement may be particularly useful in identifying cases of masked megaloblastic anemia where the MCV is below 100 fL The advantage of the MPXI over other methods of uncovering masked megaloblastic anemia is its simplicity when performed as part of a routine complete blood count on an automated hematology instrument
S936	We undertook a randomized doubleblind comparison of griseofulvin and ketoconazole for the treatment of tinea capitis The outcome was based on fungal culture results and changes in clinical signs and symptoms determined by an assessment system that yielded a severity score Patients were evaluated at 4week intervals for 12 weeks Seventynine patients were enrolled 46 received griseofulvin and 33 received ketoconazole Fortyeight patients 26 griseofulvin 22 ketoconazole were considered evaluable Pathogenic fungi were isolated from 78 of the enrolled and 87 of the evaluable patients Trichophyton tonsurans was the predominant dermatophyte isolated Potassium hydroxide preparation correlated poorly with culture results sensitivity 59 Of 22 evaluable ketoconazole patients 16 73 were considered to have been treated successfully 25 of 26 96 patients who received griseofulvin were successfully treated chisquare  354 p less than 010 The proportion of culturepositive patients at each followup visit appeared somewhat greater for the ketoconazoletreated group than for the griseofulvintreated group but the differences were not statistically significant Analysis of severity scores revealed no significant differences between the groups t test and MannWhitney U test No significant hepatotoxicity or other adverse reactions were observed We conclude that griseofulvin should remain the drug of choice for treating tinea capitis
S937	A 14yearold girl presented at the hospital after discovering an abdominal tumor CT scan and ultrasonography indicated a hepatic tumor and also revealed the absence of the portal vein The patient was admitted to excise the hepatic tumor It was found that the venous blood from the small intestines flowed into the left renal vein and then emptied directly into the inferior vena cava A tumor extending from the right lobe through the middle portion of the liver was excised The postoperative course was satisfactory and marked regeneration of the residual hepatic tissue was observed Also the blood level of ammonia in the superior mesenteric vein was low approximately 120 microgramsdl compared to the normal value of 350 microgramsdl in the portal vein This low blood level may indicate the presence of some homeostatic control mechanism
S938	Patient preparation and a modified operative technique are described for electrocoagulation ablation of the endometrium using a rollerbar electrode No preoperative or postoperative endometrial suppression was used Rather the endometrial cavity was denuded by suction curettage just before ablation which was performed in the early proliferative phase of the menstrual cycle Lidocaine paracervical block containing vasopressin was injected at the start of the procedure to control pain and to minimize bleeding and irrigation fluid absorption Pulsed irrigation of the uterus was used to improve visibility through uterine debris and the bubbles generated by the electrical current The first 20 patients who had electrocoagulation ablation of the endometrium with these modifications were compared with the first 18 patients who had laser coagulation ablation using standard technique and preoperative endometrial suppression Compared with the laser method the modified coagulation method resulted in a comparable rate of satisfactory bleeding decrease at 6 months 90 versus 94 but involved a clinically significant reduction in total anesthesia time 668 versus 1173 minutes and volume of irrigation fluid used 57 versus 159 L
S939	To compare the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous and intravenous infusion of opioid analgesics a randomised doubleblind crossover trial was carried out in inpatients 15 patients with severe cancer pain received two 48 h infusions of hydromorphoneone subcutaneously and one intravenously in randomly allocated order The study was made doubleblind by the use of two infusion pumps throughout during the active subcutaneous infusion the intravenous pump delivered saline and vice versa Serial measurements of pain intensity pain relief mood and sedation by means of visual analogue scales showed no clinically or statistically significant difference between the two infusion routes Sideeffects were slight and the mean number of morphine injections for breakthrough pain did not differ significantly between the routes 48 SD 45 for intravenous vs 53 56 for subcutaneous Plasma hydromorphone concentrations measured at 24 h and 48 h of infusion showed stable steadystate pharmacokinetics the mean bioavailability from subcutaneous infusion was 78 of that with intravenous infusion Because of the simplicity technical advantages and costeffectiveness of continuous subcutaneous opioid infusion into the chest wall or trunk intravenous opioid infusion for the management of severe cancer pain should be abandoned
S940	Cytology of intraoperative pleural lavage was examined in 164 lung cancer patients who underwent pulmonary resections None of the patients had any pleural effusion or dissemination Cytology was performed three times 1 at thoracotomy 2 immediately after resection and 3 after washing the pleural cavity with 5000 mL of physiological saline solution just before closure of the chest wall Twentythree patients 14 had more than one positive cytological finding The frequency of positive cytological findings was significantly correlated with pathological T classification pleural status and pathological stage The positive lavage group had a significantly higher recurrence rate than the negative lavage group in patients with stage I or stage II cancer Four patients in the positive lavage group 174 had recurrence in pleura or pericardium whereas only 1 patient in the negative lavage group 07 had a recurrence in pericardium The positive cytological finding of pleural lavage has more important meaning as a prognostic factor in stage I and stage II and indicates a greater possibility of recurrence in pleura or pericardium but further examinations to evaluate the viability of detected malignant cells are required so that the positive cytological findings of pleural lavage can be regarded as subclinical pleural dissemination
S941	Sixteen women with endometriosis were treated with daily subcutaneous injections of a potent agonist of gonadotropinreleasing hormone GnRH for six months Ovarian estrogen secretion was reduced to castrate levels during most of the course of treatment Blinded evaluation of laparoscopic photographs confirmed marked suppression of visually apparent disease but biopsy specimens showed occult inactive endometriosis in most cases Marked pain relief was noted by all patients As a result of this medical oophorectomy the women experienced severe hot flashes and many had insomnia and emotional disturbances Vaginal cytology showed menopausal changes but related symptoms were generally mild Calcium excretion rose to menopausal levels Highdensity lipoprotein and total cholesterol remained unchanged These results indicate that GnRH agonist administration has impressive effects on endometriotic implants and these actions may be enhanced with longer therapy Further development of this new form of therapy should involve either use of lesser degrees of ovarian suppression or adjunctive therapy to counter the side effects of medical oophorectomy
S942	Fiftytwo patients with tetralogy of Fallot underwent repair between March 1985 and July 1987 The repair was made without a ventriculotomy whenever feasible There were no 0 early or latephase deaths 70 confidence limits 0 to 36 Operative reports and preoperative angiocardiograms were retrospectively reviewed to delineate determinants for operative approach Two distinct morphologic subgroups were observed angiographically and confirmed intraoperatively Thirtytwo patients 62 had severe hypertrophy of the infundibular septal structures Each of these 32 underwent transatrial and transpulmonary repair of the infundibular stenosis and 12 of them also required a limited ventriculotomy to enlarge a hypoplastic pulmonary valve anulus The other 20 patients 38 were found to have hypoplasia and not hypertrophy of the infundibular septum Each of these required a formal transventricular approach to the repair with an infundibular patch inserted to relieve the infundibular stenosis Right ventricularleft ventricular systolic pressure ratios after repair were not different between the groups p  079 In conclusion tetralogy of Fallot was satisfactorily repaired by means of a transatrial and transpulmonary approach in two thirds of these patients The avoidance of a ventriculotomy to accomplish repair may be suggested preoperatively by selective angiocardiogram and confirmed by intraoperative assessment These findings have important implications for the development of treatment protocols
S943	Fifteen patients with thoracic spinal cord compression from metastatic neoplastic processes were managed by spinal canal decompression via a modified costotransversectomy approach Ten of the patients also underwent sequential posterior stabilization with Luque or Harrington instrumentation based upon proximity of the lesion to the thoracolumbar junction prognosis for regaining or maintaining ambulatory ability and additional spinal stability considerations A modified lateral decubitus position with the scapula falling away from the side of exposure was used for T15 segment lesions and a prone position was used for the T6T12 segment Adequate decompression of the spinal canal was achieved in all cases All patients who were ambulating preoperatively maintained ambulatory ability and pain andor further neurological improvement as well occurred in 75
S944	Abnormalities of the upper urinary tract were sought retrospectively in 180 children with constipation who had been investigated surgically over a 5year period Of those in whom an intravenous urogram had been performed the incidence of dilatation of the upper renal tract was high but only 12 of the patients with nonorganic constipation had been so investigated
S945	Attempts to determine the ideal number of consultant neurologists that will be required in the United Kingdom in the future are hampered by a lack of information on a variety of topics one of which concerns the workload of the average neurologist at the present time This paper attempts to correct this deficiency by examining the clinical workload of a single handed neurologist practising in the south west of England Diagnostic information is given on the 3020 new patients seen during 19841986 and is compared with similar data on 836 new patients seen in 1975 The pattern of diagnoses on these patients varies little from year to year indicating a constancy of referral habit of those who seek neurological advice However the referral rates for different conditions do not correspond with what would be expected from epidemiological data for when the incidence of particular conditions in the neurology clinic is compared with the calculated incidence in the community very wide variations are noted The implications of these data are discussed and it is suggested that further studies should be performed before detailed predictions are made on how many neurologists will be needed in this country in the future
S946	We have investigated whether the alternatively spliced form of thyroid peroxidase TPO which has been shown clearly to occur in Graves thyroid is present in normal thyroid We have performed a polymerase chain reaction on cDNAs prepared from normal thyroid mRNAs using primers 100 bases upstream and downstream from the 171 nucleotides that have been shown to be spliced out Size analysis of the polymerase chain reaction products by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed bands at 02 and 037 kilobases kb sizes predicted to be obtained when the two forms of TPO cDNA are present This was confirmed by hybridization with a 32Plabeled probe corresponding to the 20 nucleotides of the junction site After stringent washing the 02kb band gave a clear positive signal which was stronger than that of the 037kb band despite the latter cDNA being more abundant This demonstrates clearly that the alternatively spliced form of TPO exists in normal thyroid Its significance is discussed
S947	The tolerance of the duodenal mucosa to luminal acid was investigated by measuring with a liquid sensor pH microelectrode technique the epithelial surface pH pHs and subepithelial tissue pH pHt in rat proximal duodenal bulb Brunner gland area and distal duodenum exposed to luminal acid Under basal conditions pHs was roughly equal in both parts of the duodenum proximal duodenum 740  014 mean  SEM at the villus tip and 754  016 at the depth of crypt distal duodenum 746  019 and 755  009 respectively Yet exposure of the mucosa to luminal acid 10 mM HCl provoked a significantly lesser decrease of pHs 025  013 vs 042  012 pH units in the proximal duodenum suggesting that the response of epithelial HCO3 secretion to luminal acid is stronger in that part of the duodenum Further the initial acidification of pHs was followed in the proximal duodenum by a secondary alkalinization of pHs leading to normalization of pHs which may suggest activation of compensatory protective mechanisms pHt at the villus tip was likewise roughly equal in both parts of duodenum 729  005 vs 717  004 but again acidification of the luminal perfusate progressively from 10 to 100 mM HCl induced a much earlier and significantly more profound acidification in the distal than in the proximal duodenum The possible contribution of Brunner glands to the greater mucosal tolerance to acid in the proximal duodenum was assessed by investigating whether stimulation or inhibition of Brunner gland secretion modulates the response of the duodenal mucosa to acidABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S948	Intradiscal pressure and volume measurements were made in 84 fresh cadaveric lumbar spine disc spaces The nucleus was injected with a roentgenographic contrast agent under fluoroscopic examination The intrinsic pressure the pressure at which the agent entered the disc and the maximum pressure that the disc could hold were measured The discs were graded for degeneration The intrinsic and maximum pressures were found to be inversely related to disc degeneration grade and directly related to each other Relatively greater degeneration was found at lower levels of the lumbar spine as compared to the upper levels The intrinsic disc pressure may prove to be a useful clinical tool in the evaluation of spinal integrity
S949	PURPOSE To our knowledge there has been no report documenting the spectrum of peritonitis in human immunodeficiency virus HIVinfected persons We therefore analyzed our records to confirm our previous observation of a higher incidence of pseudomonal and fungal peritonitis in a group of HIV antibodypositive HIV patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis CAPD PATIENTS AND METHODS During a 22month period we retrospectively studied 71 patients with endstage renal disease undergoing CAPD Of these seven were HIV five were at high risk for HIV infection but antibodynegative and 59 were at low risk for HIV infection Organisms isolated in episodes of peritonitis were classified microbiologically as one of the following grampositive nonpseudomonal gramnegative pseudomonal fungal or culturenegative RESULTS The total peritonitis rate was higher in both the highrisk p less than or equal to 001 and the HIV p less than or equal to 002 groups when compared with that in the lowrisk population These differences were attributable to the following 1 the highrisk groups twofold increase in grampositive infections p less than or equal to 001 and 2 a 24fold increase in pseudomonal p less than 0001 infections and sevenfold increase in fungal p less than 0005 infections in the HIV group These infections were invariably associated with catheter loss and frequently resulted in conversion to hemodialysis CONCLUSION We believe that the use of CAPD in HIV patients may be limited by this increased occurrence of pseudomonal and fungal peritonitis
S950	Yearly fecal occult blood testing FOBT has been recommended for men and women over age 50 years as part of a screening regimen intended to reduce colorectal cancer mortality The primary targets of screening are early surgically curable colon cancers and large adenomatous colon polyps however screening may sometimes reveal only small adenomas ie less than 1 cm in diameter To assess the rates and mechanisms of FOBT detection of small adenomas we performed quantitative analyses utilizing estimates of adenoma bleeding rates and FOBT sensitivity and specificity The analysis suggests that the mechanisms of detection of small adenomas is often chance or serendipity This occurs when an FOBT result is falsely positive because of diet or nonneoplastic gastrointestinal bleeding and leads to colonoscopic discovery of a nonbleeding small adenoma Nevertheless small adenomas remain undetected in most persons who have them even if repeated yearly FOBT screening is done The identification of persons with small adenomas should not be assumed to be an important beneficial outcome of FOBT screening because the clinical significance of small adenomas is not clear the mechanism of detection is serendipity and only a minority of persons with small adenomas are identified The current recommendations to perform periodic surveillance colonoscopy following removal of small adenomas detected during FOBT screening should be reexamined
S951	The effects of chronic administration of U50488H trans34dichloroN21pyrrolidinylcyclohexylbenzeacetamide  a selective kappa opioid agonist on the development of tolerance to its analgesic and hypothermic effects and on mu delta and kappa opioid receptors in brain regions and spinal cord of male SpragueDawley rats were determined Rats were injected ip twice daily with 25 mgkg of U50488H for 4 days The development of tolerance to the analgesic and hypothermic effects of U50488H was almost complete after 4 days of treatment 3HTyrDAlaGlyMePheGlyol DAMGO 3HTyrDSerGlyPheLeuThr DSTLE and 3Hethylketocyclazocine EK were used as ligands for mu delta and kappa opioid receptors respectively The binding of 3HDAMGO to membranes prepared from various brain regions pons  medulla midbrain hypothalamus corpus striatum and cortex and spinal cord was unaffected by chronic administration of U50488H The binding of 3HDSTLE in U50488Htreated rats was decreased in spinal cord and increased in corpus striatum The binding of 3HEK to membranes prepared from pons  medulla midbrain cortex and spinal cord was decreased whereas it was increased in the corpus striatum The changes in the binding of 3HDSTLE and 3HEK after chronic treatment with U50488H were due to changes in the maximum binding values and not in the Kd values The results indicate that in the rat chronic administration of U50488H results in the development of tolerance to its analgesic and hypothermic effects and downregulation of kappa and delta opioid receptors in the spinal cord and an upregulation in the corpus striatumABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S952	Six patients with pregnancies of 1931 weeks duration showing evidence of erythroblastosis fetalis were treated with 25 fetal intracardiac blood transfusions Complications related to the procedure occurred on five occasions in three patients In two of the six patients the fetus died but it was unlikely that death was related to the intracardiac transfusions Fetal intracardiac blood transfusion may result in potentially severe complications but offers an alternative when transfusion cannot be performed into the umbilical cord
S953	Exogenously administered tumor necrosis factoralpha TNF and bacterial endotoxin LPS induce shock and tissue injury Here the authors studied the effect of endogenous TNF on LPSinduced hypotension and tissue injury and investigated the role of PAF in these responses Rats were primed with intraperitoneal injection of zymosan 24 hours before or Bacillus CalmetteGuerin BCG 12 to 15 days before intravenous injection of low dose 05 mgkg LPS It was found that nonprimed animals showed mild hypotension and moderate leukopenia in response to LPS In contrast zymosanprimed rats developed shock and marked leukopenia and more severe bowel injury than nonprimed rats The authors then showed that following LPS injection zymosanprimed animals had higher TNF and plateletactivating factor PAF levels than nonprimed rats Pretreatment of the animal with PAF antagonist SRI 63441 markedly ameliorated the hypotension and tissue injury Interestingly BCGprimed rats did not show aggravation of LPSinduced hypotension Only TNF but not PAF level in these animals was increased Thus it appears that TNF release alone without a sufficient increase in PAF is incapable of causing severe hypotension However most of the BCGprimed animals showed tissue injury which could be prevented by pretreatment with PAF antagonist The authors discuss the possible mechanisms of this discrepancy between systemic and local responses in BCGprimed animals
S954	Intraoral osseous and cartilaginous choristomas are rare lesions with only 72 cases previously reported in the literature Three additional cases are presented and the literature is reviewed One case represents the first reported osseous choristoma on the retromolar pad
S955	The authors reviewed 55 pairs of chest radiographs and computed tomographic CT studies obtained in 33 febrile bone marrow transplant BMT recipients The images were read separately without knowledge of the clinical diagnosis Twentyone episodes of fungal infection were documented One chest radiograph showed a pneumonialike opacity and 17 showed nodular opacities five with cavitation In 20 of 21 episodes CT showed nodules with cavitation n  7 halo n  4 hazy margin n  5 air bronchogram n  2 cluster of fluffy nodules n  1 or sharp margin n  1 In none of the nine bacteremic episodes however were there opacities on chest radiographs or CT studies CT studies demonstrating complicated nodules in febrile BMT patients strongly suggest a fungal infection whereas negative CT studies suggest bacteremia or nonfilamentous fungal infection of nonpulmonary origin CT appears to add useful information to radiographic analysis during the assessment of febrile episodes in BMT patients especially when invasive diagnostic procedures pose a high risk
S956	We report the successful treatment with cyclosporine of a patient with steroid resistant interstitial pneumonitis associated with polymyositis and review the literature regarding the use of cyclosporine in the treatment of interstitial lung disease
S957	In four groups of 10 patients 05 bupivacaine 5 ml was used in spinal anaesthesia for gynaecological surgery Group 1 received plain solution in the sitting position group 2 plain solution in the lateral position group 3 hyperbaric solution in the sitting position and group 4 hyperbaric solution in the lateral position All patients were returned to the horizontal supine position the sitting subjects 2 min after and the lateral subjects immediately after spinal injection In each group the mean height of block was to the midthoracic segments but there was no significant difference between the groups There was however considerable scatter within each group Posture had some effect on the speed of onset of the analgesia but no significant effect on the final outcome The use of 05 bupivacaine as a test dose in extradural blockade is discussed
S958	Separate groups of rats were trained to discriminate the stimulus properties of selective agonists at 5HT receptors using a conditioned taste aversion procedure Fluidrestricted rats were injected with drug or saline and then given access to a 025 saccharin solution for 30 min When rats received a drug trial saccharin consumption was followed by an injection of LiCl 18 mEqkg ip whereas on saline trials saccharin consumption was followed by a second injection of saline instead of LiCl Rats were trained using injections of either 8hydroxy2dinpropylaminotetralin 04 mgkg ip an agonist selective for the 5HT1A receptor or 1mtrifluoromethylphenylpiperazine 08 mgkg ip an agonist selective for 5HT1B and 5HT1C receptors as the drug stimuli Acquisition of the discriminated taste aversion as measured by the differential effects on saccharin drinking between drug and saline trials required only two to three pairings of either drug stimulus with LiCl injections The 8hydroxy2dinpropylaminotetralin discriminative stimulus cue generalized to other drugs that are selective for the 5HT1A receptor such as ipsapirone 816 mgkg ip or buspirone 4 mgkg ip but not to agonists that are selective for the 5HT1B1C receptor such as 1mtrifluoromethylphenylpiperazine or 1mchlorophenylpiperazine The discriminative stimulus properties of 1mtrifluoromethylphenylpiperazine generalized to 1mchlorophenylpiperazine 0208 mgkg ip but not to the 5HT1A agonist 8hydroxy2dinpropylaminotetralin 04 mgkg ipABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S959	A number of animal models have been developed to investigate the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis In general rabbits guinea pigs and dogs have been the animals of choice although rats mice and birds have also been used The techniques used to induce disease development include destabilization of a knee joint either by extra or intraarticular surgical manipulation immobilization of the knee joint to alter load impact and distribution or introduction of a foreign substance into the joint space The success of a particular animal model rests in the ability to parallel on a temporal basis the biological changes which characterize osteoarthritic development as seen in the human population Macroscopic microscopic and biochemical evaluations then permit the detailing of the steps which lead to cartilage erosion In this manner link proteins have been found to be deficient in osteoarthritic guinea pig cartilage
S960	Cancer of the larynx occurs most often in men between 50 and 70 years of age Cigarette smoking and alcohol are responsible for more than 75 percent of cases Hoarseness is the most common presenting complaint If hoarseness persists for more than two weeks laryngoscopy is indicated Clinical staging utilizes direct laryngoscopy esophagoscopy and bronchoscopy to exclude synchronous malignancies The fiveyear cure rate with preservation of voice and glottic function is as high as 90 percent if the lesions of the vocal cords are found in an early stage Total laryngectomy is required for more extensive disease Speech rehabilitation has been revolutionized by tracheoesophageal speech techniques
S961	In human T lymphocytes the antigen receptor Ti is associated noncovalently on the cell surface with the invariant T3 antigen which comprises 3 chains two glycosylated polypeptides of relative molecular mass 26000 Mr 26K and 21K gamma and delta and one nonNglycosylated polypeptide of Mr 19K epsilon The proposed function of T3 is to transduce the activation signals delivered via the antigen receptor Recently we have shown that phorbol esters which stimulate protein kinase C can induce phosphorylation of the gamma subunit of the T3 antigen But the critical question is whether T3 phosphorylation occurs as a normal consequence of immune activation of T lymphocytes In this respect it has been shown that immune stimulation of murine T cells results in phosphorylation of Tiassociated polypeptides that may be the functional analogues of the human T3 antigen We have therefore monitored T3 phosphorylation after exposure of human T cells to antigen or phytohaemagglutinin PHA The data show that both stimuli initiate phosphorylation of the gamma subunit of the T3 antigen which indicates that T3 phosphorylation is a physiological response to immune activation
S962	Several reports indicate that acute ethanol promotes the cleavage of brain sialoglycoconjugates SGC We attempted to confirm this effect by monitoring cleavage of sialic acid SA that had been radiolabeled by pretreatment with the specific precursor of SA N3HacetylDmannosamine injected intracerebroventricularly into rats 20 h prior to ethanol injection 2 or 3 gkg given four times in a simulated binge drinking protocol Analysis of the residual labeled material revealed a significant reduction of radiolabel p less than 001 as compared to saline controls A dose of 3 gkg diminished the total labeled SGC by half Brain sialidase activity was not affected by the ethanol treatment Since ethanol intoxication is associated with enhanced SA cleavage one hypothesis needing testing is that loss of SA might help to cause intoxication If so pretreatment with SA might antagonize intoxication presumably by offsetting loss due to cleavage of SA Consistent with our earlier results we found that when sialic acid was given ip 25 mgkg 1 6 or 24 h prior to ethanol injection 4 gkg ip the sleep time was reduced by 3540 and the performance on rotorod was significantly enhanced p less than 001 When ethanol was replaced by pentobarbital 40 mgkg the sleep time was increased approximately 30 at 6 h after injection with either 25 or 100 mgkg sialic acid whereas at the 24 h postinjection it was decreased approximately 20 at both doses The results suggest that sialic acid is a key component in mediating ethanol effects and perhaps also in a different way anesthetic effects
S963	Preschool age children often experience marked anxiety and physical pain during laceration repair Locally infiltrated anesthetics or topical tetracaine adrenaline and cocaine TAC usually control the physical pain but have little or no effect on anxiety Midazolam is a shortacting benzodiazepine with anxiolytic hypnotic and antegrade amnestic effects In a doubleblind randomized clinical trial we evaluated the efficacy of midazolam in alleviating anxiety during laceration repair in children less than 6 years old On admission to the emergency department anxiety level was determined on a scale of 1 to 4 based on a predetermined behavior criteria Patients with high anxiety level 3 or 4 received a single oral dose of either midazolam 02 mgkg or placebo The anxiolytic effect of midazolam was considered adequate if the anxiety level decreased two or more points from 4 to less than or equal to 2 or from 3 to 1 during laceration repair In the midazolam group 30 70 of the children had a twopoint or more decrease in anxiety level compared with 12 in the placebo group 25 P less than 0001 No respiratory depression or other complications were noted in the midazolam group We conclude that a single oral dose of midazolam 02 mgkg is a safe and effective treatment for alleviating anxiety in children less than 6 years old during laceration repair in the ED
S964	Although a thoracic volume dependence of upper airway resistance and caliber is known to exist in seated subjects the mechanisms mediating this phenomenon are unknown To test the hypothesis that actively altered endexpiratory lung volume EELV affects upper airway resistance in the supine position and to explore the mechanisms of any EELVinduced resistance changes we studied five normal males during wakefulness Supraglottic upper airway resistance Ruaw was calculated at an inspiratory flow of 01 ls The genioglossal electromyogram was obtained with indwelling wire electrodes and processed as moving time average Endtidal CO2 was monitored by infrared analyzer Observations were made during four 20breath voluntary maneuvers two at high and two at low EELV in each subject Each maneuver was preceded by a control period at functional residual capacity At high lung volume the EELV was increased by 223  054 SD liters Ruaw decreased to 678  351 of control while tonic and phasic genioglossal activities declined to 790  231 and 724  298 respectively At low lung volume the EELV was decreased by 086  023 liters Ruaw increased to 1782  1868 while tonic and phasic genioglossal activities increased to 2430  1393 and 2491  1463 respectively P less than 00001 for all The findings were not explained by CO2 perturbations or respiratory pattern Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that the genioglossal responses blunted the EELVinduced changes in upper airway patencyABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS

S966	To determine whether the peripheral sympathetic neurons of subhuman primates are destroyed by guanacline treatment we treated Macaca fasicularis with 2 or 20 mgkg of guanethidine guanacline or the saturated analog of guanacline SAG 5 times per week for 4 or 12 weeks All monkeys given 20 mgkg of guanethidine guanacline or SAG showed a marked loss of neurons in the ganglia of the peripheral sympathetic nervous system Treatment of macaques with 2 mgkg of the guanidinium compounds resulted in patches of smallcell infiltrate slight neuronal loss and degenerative alterations in the sympathetic ganglia Neuronal alterations in sympathetic ganglia of all treated monkeys were accompanied by a prominent heterogeneous infiltrate of mononuclear cells arranged primarily in a perivascular distribution and extending into the ganglionic neuropil Peripheral sensory ganglia were unaffected These histological findings are similar to those described in the guanethidineinduced immunemediated sympathectomy which has been extensively studied in the rat
S967	To determine whether the central vasopressinergic system at the level of nucleus tractus solitarii NTS modulates the reflex control of heart rate we employed a new method for microinjection into the brainstem of conscious freely moving rats Baroreceptor reflex function was assessed during pressure changes induced by intravenous administration of phenylephrine 0258 microgramskg and sodium nitroprusside 0516 microgramskg in rats microinjected through a permanent cannula into the brainstem with saline arginine vasopressin AVP or an AVP blocker Baseline levels of pressure and heart rate were not changed by either peptide pretreatment Restricted injection of AVP 20 ng02 microliter into the NTS attenuated the reflex bradycardia during pressure increases with an upward displacement of the baroreceptor reflex function line p less than 001 without change in the sensitivity Local blockade of endogenous AVP dCH25TyrMeAVP 1 microgram02 microliter depressed baroreceptor reflex sensitivity with intense bradycardia to either small or large pressure increases Baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate in response to decreases in pressure was preserved during pretreatment with AVP whereas endogenous blockade of AVP increased baroreceptor reflex sensitivity These effects were specific to the NTS since in another four rats there were no effects when the injections were made 1 mm above into the cerebellum The changes in baroreceptor reflex control of heart rate in conscious unrestrained rats caused by administration of AVP and its endogenous blockade provide evidence that central vasopressinergic synapses at the NTS are important physiological modulators of baroreceptor reflex function
S968	The 193nm ultraviolet beam from an argon fluoride excimer laser was focused on the corneas of rabbits to produce incisions of the type necessary for radial keratotomy The energy densities used were in two ranges 10 to 21 Jcm2 per pulse and 200 to 700 mJcm2 per pulse The eyes were enucleated and fixed for histologic and electron microscopic examination immediately after exposure Structural analysis of the higher energy density exposures showed ridging on the surface of the cornea micropitting on the stromal surface inside the cut and denudation of the endothelium under the ablation zone The lower energy density incisions did not exhibit significant surface ridging or endothelial cell loss but did exhibit significant stromal swelling during the laser exposure thus making it difficult to produce incisions of a precisely controlled depth Beam profile measurements and infrared thermal measurements of the cornea surface during laser exposure were made
S969	In a blind trial 77 patients were randomised to receive first cadaver kidney allografts that had been perfused either with a pair of CD45 monoclonal antibodies mAbs in an attempt to reduce the immunogenicity of passenger leucocytes or with control human albumin solution No complications of mAb perfusion were observed Patient and allograft survival were similar in both groups Rejection episodes were recorded in 7 18 of the patient with mAb perfused allografts compared with 24 63 of the controls
S970	Bite wounds usually by dogs cats and human beings affect one of two Americans during his or her lifetime and 1 to 2 million Americans annually Despite the relative frequency of bite wounds there are few prospective studies to define optimal care consequently diverse methods are used In this article I review the incidence bacteriology clinical spectrum complications and treatment of animal and human bite wounds The spectrum of pathogenic bacteria that cause bite infections is broader than is generally appreciated and includes both aerobic and anaerobic bacteria Pasteurella multocida is found in only 20 to 25 of dog bite wounds In choosing empiric antimicrobial therapy clinicians must consider the diverse causative bacteria and their characteristic susceptibility patterns Liberal irrigation and elevation of the injured part are also cornerstones of therapy Early aggressive medical and surgical management can minimize if not prevent complications
S971	Two hundred fortytwo voluntary blood donors referred after detection of HBsAg positivity underwent clinical evaluation and liver biopsy and were prospectively followed for an average of 35 years At initial testing 65 of HBsAg carriers had normal laboratory findings during followup 26 of these carriers developed abnormal test results at least transiently Liver histology was normal in 314 revealed nonaggressive liver disease in 636 and chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis in 5 only All except one case of chronic active hepatitis or cirrhosis were associated with abnormal blood biochemical tests Sequential liver biopsies obtained in 56 HBsAg carriers after a minimal interval of 4 years showed mitigation of inflammatory changes in 54 and developing chronic active hepatitis in three cases 54 One carrier died of primary hepatocellular carcinoma Upon followup HBsAg persisted in 98 AntiHBe was found in 90 of all carriers already at the initial testing HBeAg positivity 75 was associated with chronic active hepatitis as well as nonaggressive liver disease clearance of HBeAg occurred in 40 after 2 to 8 years Because of the subclinical progression of liver disease and the increased risk for developing primary hepatocellular carcinoma in asymptomatic HBsAg carriers routine blood testing including alphafetoprotein screening as well as abdominal ultrasound surveillance are indicated Liver biopsy however should be restricted to carriers with abnormal biochemical findings
S972	The enzymes responsible for the sulfate conjugation of LT3 in man has not been characterized T3 sulfotransferase T3ST activity was characterized in normal human liver tissue obtained during clinically indicated surgical resection Subcellular distribution studies showed that the T3ST activity was localized to the cytoplasmic fraction This finding raised the possibility that T3ST activity might be similar to the 2 previously identified forms of cytoplasmic phenol sulfotransferase PST found in human tissue A thermostable TS form of PST catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of micromolar concentrations of pnitrophenol and a thermolabile TL form catalyzes the sulfate conjugation of dopamine and other monoamines Thermal stability and enzyme inhibitor experiments showed that T3ST activity in pooled liver homogenates was very similar to the TS form of PST The apparent similarity of T3ST to TS PST was studied further by measuring T3ST TS PST and TL PST activities in 20 individual liver samples T3ST activities correlated significantly with TS PST activities r  0939 P less than 0001 measured with pnitrophenol but not with TL PST activities r  0118 P greater than 06 measured with dopamine However sulfation of T3 by the TL form of the enzyme might have been masked by the 18fold higher specific activity of TS than TL PST in human liver homogenates When the two forms of PST were separated by ion exchange chromatography T3 was found to be a substrate for both the TS and TL forms of PST True Km values for T3 were similar for TS and TL PST 81 and 127 microM respectively
S973	To evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative outflow resistance OR measurements in predicting late graft patency rates PR for femoropopliteal FP and femoroinfrapopliteal FD bypasses we have reviewed 134 such cases performed during the past 3 years at our institution Of these 64 bypasses were FP 13 autogenous saphenous vein ASV and 51 polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE and 70 were FD 43 ASV and 27 PTFE Total and distal OR measurements measured in millimeters of mercury per milliliter per minute were divided into four groups each for all infrainguinal bypasses combined and for FP and FD bypasses separately The relationship of PR to total and distal OR measurements were analyzed according to the product limit method Overall 1 and 2year PRs were 64 and 56 respectively For FP bypasses the same PRs were 78 and 67 whereas for FD bypasses they were 52 and 45 respectively The 1year PRs for FP and FD bypasses within each respective OR group were analyzed For FP bypasses in the lowest to the highest total OR groups the 1year PRs were 86 75 78 and 62 NS and for FD bypasses they were 72 89 23 and 22 p less than 0001 Similar trends were observed when distal OR measurements were analyzed For infrainguinal PTFE bypasses both total and distal OR measurements were significant predictors of patency whereas for those with ASV only distal OR measurements were predictive These data reaffirm our early experience with OR measurements Although a trend for predicting graft patency was noted for FP bypasses OR measurements were highly predictive only for FD bypasses
S974	We measured total chest wall impedance Zw pathway impedances of the rib cage Zrcpath and diaphragmabdomen Zdapath and impedance of the belly wall including abdominal contents Zbw in five subjects during sustained expiratory change in average pleural pressure Ppl from relaxation  10 and 20 cmH2O and inspiratory change in Ppl  10 and 20 cmH2O muscle contraction using forced oscillatory techniques 054 Hz we have previously reported for relaxation J Appl Physiol 66 350359 1989 Chest wall configuration and mean lung volume were kept constant Zw Zrcpath Zdapath and Zbw all increased greatly at each frequency during expiratory muscle contraction increases were proportional to effort Zw Zrcpath and Zdapath increased greatly during inspiratory muscle contraction but Zbw did not Resistances and elastances calculated from each of the impedances showed the same changes during muscle contraction as the corresponding impedances Each of the resistances decreased as frequency increased independent of effort elastances generally increased with frequency These frequency dependencies were similar to those measured in relaxed or tetanized isolated muscle during sinusoidal stretching PM Rack J Physiol Lond 183 114 1966 We conclude that during respiratory muscle contraction 1 chest wall impedance increases 2 changes in regional chest wall impedances can be somewhat independent depending on which muscles contract and 3 increases in chest wall impedance are due at least in part to changes in the passive properties of the muscles themselves
S975	Simple microphthalmos was diagnosed in 22 patients on the basis of a normalappearing eye and a total axial length at least 2 SDs below the mean for age Anterior segment length was normal in most patients while posterior segment length was at least 2 SDs below the mean in all patients indicating that disproportionate reduction in posterior segment length accounted for the microphthalmos The normal values for total axial length anterior segment length and posterior segment length were determined from the analysis of axial length measurements obtained from agesimilar controls Ten patients had isolated microphthalmos One of them was diagnosed as having nanophthalmos on the basis of microcornea total axial length less than 18 mm and absence of systemic disease Twelve patients had associated systemic disorders such as fetal alcohol syndrome myotonic dystrophy and achondroplasia which implicated decreased size of the optic cup altered vitreous proteoglycans low intraocular pressure and abnormal release of growth factors in the pathogenesis of microphthalmos
S976	By means of the polymerase chain reaction PCR technique DNA sequences were amplified that flank the crossover sites of a characteristic chromosomal translocation for follicular lymphomas t1418q32q21 This technique permitted the detection of cells carrying the t1418 hybrid DNA sequences at a dilution of 1100000 The remission marrow and blood samples of a patient with follicular lymphoma and the t1418 failed to show any abnormality by morphological examination and conventional Southern blot analysis However the t1418 hybrid DNA sequences were detected by the PCR technique Thus this technique is a highly sensitive tool to detect minimal residual cells carrying the t1418 and has the potential to identify a subpopulation of patients with subclinical disease
S977	To develop an androgen receptorbased positronemitting imaging agent for prostate tumors we have prepared 20fluoromibolerone FMib and evaluated its tissue distribution This compound was synthesized in eight steps from 7 alphamethyl19nortestosterone with fluorine introduced in the penultimate step by fluoride ion displacement on a spirocyclic sulfate Fluoromibolerone was obtained in 919 radiochemical yield decay corrected at 15 hr after bombardment with an effective specific activity of 217283 Cimmol The relative binding affinity of FMib is 53 versus R1881  100 or mibolerone  118 In tissue distribution studies in diethylstilbestroltreated male rats 18FMib demonstrates high targettissue uptake efficiency and selectivity the prostate uptake at 05 hr and 4 hr is 1013 injected dosegram tissue IDg and 0506 IDg respectively the prostatetoblood and the prostatetomuscle nontarget ratios are both ca 4 at 05 hr and increase to ca 12 by 4 hr after injection The observed distribution of 18FMib suggests that it may be useful for in vivo imaging of prostatic tumors in man by positron emission tomography
S978	In summary the eicosanoids and PAF modulate the immune response in vitro and in vivo The PG seem to attenuate and TX LT and PAF to potentiate the cellmediated immune response In addition these compounds have nonimmunologic effects that may modify the edema and decreased blood flow associated with the rejection process
S979	Four infants with newly diagnosed cystic fibrosis developed a bulging anterior fontanel within days of starting enzyme replacement treatment In the same time period 41 hospitalized patients less than 1 year of age were diagnosed as having cystic fibrosis and treated suggesting that increased intracranial pressure is common in this setting 97 The clinical course of the four infants was similar the bulging fontanel became apparent 16 days after initiation of pancreatic enzyme replacement and resolved within 1 week in three patients and within 4 months in the other patient Two patients became mildly irritable Computed cranial tomography and lumbar puncture were done in three patients with completely normal findings except elevated cerebrospinal fluid pressure in two infants There was no apparent difference in this treatment or clinical course before diagnosis between the four infants who developed a transient bulging fontanel compared with the overall group of cystic fibrosis patients
S980	The role of the 100kDa polypeptide components of clathrincoated vesicles in endocytosis was investigated by microinjection of specific monoclonal antibodies Receptormediated uptake of transferrin and liposomes was quantitatively inhibited These results show that the 100kDa polypeptides are directly involved in localized clathrin assembly at the cell periphery and are markers for the endocytic pathway This demonstrates an in situ function of these polypeptides and the protein complexes in which they are found
S981	Fatal foodinduced anaphylaxis is rarely reported In 16 months we identified seven such cases involving five males and two females aged 11 to 43 years All victims were atopic with multiple prior anaphylactic episodes after ingestion of the incriminated food peanut four pecan one crab one fish one In six cases the allergenic food was ingested away from home Factors contributing to the severity of individual reactions included denial of symptoms concomitant intake of alcohol reliance on oral antihistamines alone to treat symptoms and adrenal suppression by chronic glucocorticoid therapy for coexisting asthma In no case was epinephrine administered immediately after onset of symptoms Premortem or postmortem serum samples were available from six victims in each case elevated levels of IgE antibodies to the incriminated food were demonstrated Foodsensitive individuals must selfadminister epinephrine promptly at the first sign of systemic reaction Emergency care providers should be aware of cricothyrotomy as a lifesaving procedure
S982	Synthetic peptides made by the method of simultaneous multiple peptide synthesis were coupled to the protein carrier keyhole limpet hemocyanin and used to raise mAb Omission and substitution analogs of the original peptides were tested by ELISA to characterize their reactivity with the respective mAb Linear antigenic determinants were located for 18 different peptides by using omission analogs The length of the antigenic determinants ranged from 2 to 8 residues with an average of 6 residues The three aromatic amino acids phenylalanine tryptophan and tyrosine the charged hydrophilic amino acids aspartic acid and lysine and the neutral amino acid alanine were found to occur most often in the determinant region of the peptides tested whereas asparagine cysteine and histidine occurred the least often Alanine substitution analogs provided more information than omission analogs by enabling the determination of which side chain groups of the antigenic determinant residues were not critical for binding to the mAb Detailed fingerprint information about the interaction of the peptide GASPYPNLSNQQT and its mAb was obtained by synthesizing a complete series of analogs with individual substitutions for each position of the antigenic determinant PYPNLS with the 19 other amino acids These results suggest that at the amino acid level all antigenic determinants of synthetic peptides defined by mAb can be considered discontinuous linear determinants
S983	Reduced hepatic uptake and clearance of macromolecules in liver cirrhosis is due to two major factors increased diffusional barriers resulting primarily from the deposition of excessive connective tissue in the space of Disse and hepatocellular dysfunction manifested by receptor andor postreceptor defects To probe the mechanisms underlying hepatocellular dysfunction in liver cirrhosis we have investigated receptorligand interactions for asialoorosomucoid insulin and epidermal growth factor in hepatocytes isolated from the livers of rats chronically exposed to phenobarbital and carbon tetrachloride for up to 12 weeks Viable cells were allowed to attach at 37 degrees C and the highaffinity cell surface binding sites for each ligand were assessed at 4 degrees C in the presence of 125Iligand In parallel incubations digitonin 0055 was added to the binding medium to assess total cellular binding sites Results demonstrated that chronic treatment of rats with phenobarbital increased hepatocyte asialoorosomucoid surface receptor affinity p less than 005 but had no affect on the number of asialoglycoprotein binding sites Treatment with CCl4 and phenobarbital significantly reduced the number of surface binding sites for asialoorosomucoid p less than 005 and epidermal growth factor p less than 002 although this treatment had no effect on either the binding affinity or the number of binding sites for insulin The decrease in cell surface binding sites for asialoorosomucoid and epidermal growth factor was not due to a redistribution of the surface sites to intracellular locations since the total number of cellular binding sites also was reducedABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S984	The clinical records and serial corneal endothelial images of 25 acapsular pseudophakic eyes with Kelmanstyle onepiece anteriorchamber intraocular lenses and 24 acapsular pseudophakic eyes with suturefixated posteriorchamber intraocular lenses following penetrating keratoplasty were reviewed to determine clinical success and endothelial survival after 1 year Twentytwo 88 of 25 grafts in the anteriorchamber intraocular lens group and 23 96 of 24 grafts in the sutured posteriorchamber intraocular lens group were clear after 1 year best corrected visual acuity of 2040 or better was noted in 25 of the eyes in the anteriorchamber intraocular lens group and 29 of the eyes in the sutured posteriorchamber intraocular lens group The mean intraocular pressure for the anteriorchamber intraocular lens group was significantly lower than for the sutured posteriorchamber intraocular lens group at 3 months 17  4 vs 21  7 mm Hg and at 6 months 17  3 vs 20  5 mm Hg but did not differ at 1 year The mean percent of endothelial cell loss after 1 year did not differ between the anteriorchamber intraocular lens group 32  26 and the sutured posteriorchamber intraocular lens group 27  26 No clinical or endothelial morphometric advantages were noted after 1 year for the suturefixated posteriorchamber intraocular lens over the Kelmanstyle onepiece anterior chamber intraocular lens following pseudophakic penetrating keratoplasty however a longterm prospective randomized study of these two intraocular lens types is recommended
S985	In a retrospective review of the radiographs from 100 patients who had undergone orthognathic surgery the authors found that 10 of radiographs had evidence of surgical complications These complications were fractures temporomandibular joint dislocations transected tooth roots retained surgical devices avascular necrosis malunion or nonunion of osteotomy fragments and osteomyelitis Some of these complications are of little significance while others require immediate intervention Opacified maxillary sinuses and lucencies around tooth roots are frequent findings that may be confused with abnormalities however they represent postoperative blood in the sinuses and resorption of bone due to stress from orthodontic appliances respectively
S986	Phospholipase D PLD can be activated by a variety of receptor agonists in different cell types However an effect of prostaglandins PGs on the activity of this enzyme has not been demonstrated previously In this study we found that PGE1 could stimulate PLD in human erythroleukemia cells as measured by phosphatidylethanol formation with an ED50 of 35 x 107 M PGE2 was also active but other PGs including prostacyclin PGD2 and PGF2 had no effect PGE1 also elicited cyclic AMP production over the same concentration range that activated PLD However it is unlikely that cyclic AMP per se is responsible for PGEinduced PLD activation because PLD could be substantially activated by PGE2 at concentrations 011 microM which did not stimulate cyclic AMP production Furthermore no increase of phosphatidylethanol formation could be observed when cells were treated with other adenylyl cyclaseactivating agents such as prostacyclin forskolin and vasoactive intestinal peptide In Cafree medium PLD activation by PGE1 and PGE2 was greatly reduced indicating that their effect was through a Cadependent pathway Pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin abolished PGE1 and PGE2stimulated PLD activity implying the involvement of a G protein in the PGEmediated signal transduction pathway Our results not only indicate that Eseries PGs may initiate some of their cellular effects through a novel pathway activation of PLD but also suggest that PGEstimulated PLD activity in human erythroleukemia cells is Cadependent and is regulated via a pertussis toxinsensitive G protein
S987	Severe arrhythmias occur predictably on reperfusion after 5 minutes of coronary occlusion in the rat There is little data available on whether ischemic preconditioning PC of hearts can reduce the incidence of such arrhythmias The effect of PC three cycles of 2 minutes of coronary occlusion and 5 minutes of reperfusion on development of arrhythmias after a subsequent 5minute coronary artery occlusion and reperfusion was studied Rats n  16 each group underwent 5minute occlusion and reperfusion alone or preceded by PC arrhythmias were monitored during ischemia and for 10 minutes of reperfusion and biopsies were taken for creatine phosphate and adenosine triphosphate in ischemic and nonischemic zones of the left ventricle PC reduced the incidence of ventricular tachycardia VT during occlusion 81 control versus 13 PC p less than 0001 On subsequent reperfusion ventricular fibrillation VF developed in zero PC animals versus 13 81 of controls p less than 0001 and irreversible VF in zero of PC versus seven 44 of controls p  0007 VT occurred in four 25 of PC versus all 100 of controls p less than 0001 PC reduced mean duration of VT plus VF from 320  54 to 5  1 seconds p less than 0001 and delayed arrhythmia onset from 8  2 to 85  35 seconds after reperfusion There was no difference in creatine phosphate levels in the ischemic zone at the end of reperfusion in PC animals compared with controls without irreversible VF 162  41 versus 155  39 nmolmg protein p  NSABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S988	Though a heat and moisture exchanger HME has been used in clinical practice following a tracheotomy on a limited basis no work has been done to document the humidification potential of an HME in this situation Eighteen dogs underwent tracheotomy and were killed at either 1 day nine dogs or 10 days nine dogs postoperatively Following the tracheotomy the animals were divided into three groups according to the type of humidification received ambient conditions warm mist or HME The tracheal mucosa was studied for histologic changes in the cilia the epithelium submucosal reaction and mucus production at the level of the carina The results were significant p  02 for the interaction of the experimental type and method of treatment in their effect on the histologic changes noted at the carina The study supports the use of an HME as an alternative for longterm humidification in a patient with a tracheotomy
S989	Children with primary sclerosing cholangitis or autoimmune chronic active hepatitis have similar high levels of immunoglobulin G and nonorganspecific autoantibodies and may have similar histological features To investigate a possible immunopathogenesis of primary sclerosing cholangitis we have studied a series of regulatory andor effector immune mechanisms in eight children with primary sclerosing cholangitis comparing them to 14 children with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and 24 healthy children as controls Antibodies to a liver membrane protein preparation were found in all children with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis tested and in seven of eight with primary sclerosing cholangitis whereas antibodies against the hepatic asialoglycoprotein receptor were present in three of six patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis and in two of the eight with primary sclerosing cholangitis Lymphocyte cytotoxicity values to autologous hepatocytes were similarly elevated in primary sclerosing cholangitis median 50 range 38 to 83 and in autoimmune chronic active hepatitis median 52 range 37 to 87 compared to controls median 8 range 0 to 27 p less than 001 for both In contrast T suppressor cell number and function were normal in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis median 23 range 19 to 28 and median 54 range 44 to 61 but significantly decreased in patients with autoimmune chronic active hepatitis median 15 range 9 to 21 and median 9 range 40 to 21 when compared to controls median 24 range 16 to 29 and median 53 range 8 to 77 p less than 001 for bothABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S990	A broad spectrum of gastrointestinal pathogens can cause diarrhea in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS A systematic approach utilizing symptomatology and the appropriate diagnostic tests will maximize the clinicians chance of identifying the specific pathogens Enteric infections in AIDS patients are often incurable and require prolonged therapy and chronic suppression Experimental agents show promise of decreasing the morbidity and mortality attendant on diarrhea in AIDS patients
S991	To increase understanding of the antigenic structure of Pneumocystis carinii we developed monoclonal antibodies to rat and human P carinii The specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by immunofluorescence and immunoblot studies Only one of five monoclonal antibodies to rat P carinii reacted with human P carinii and none of four monoclonal antibodies to human P carinii reacted with rat P carinii Two antibodies to human P carinii reacted by immunofluorescence with only one human P carinii isolate Immunoblot studies identified major antigens of rat P carinii with molecular masses of 40000100000 daltons and of human P carinii with molecular masses of 2200095000 daltons These studies document the existence of antigenic differences between rat and human P carinii and are consistent with the suggestion that individual isolates of human P carinii are also antigenically different Further studies with these antibodies should increase understanding of the antigenic nature of P carinii and of the interaction of P carinii with its host
S992	To quantify potential biases in the use of echocardiography in epidemiologic studies we assessed the relationship of sex age vital capacity body fatness and overt cardiovascular disease to prevalence of acceptable echocardiograms in 6148 Framingham men and women aged 17 to 90 years Echocardiograms adequate to assess left ventricular chamber dimensions and wall thickness aortic root and left atrial dimensions as well as mitral and aortic valves were obtained in 4947 80 of the 6148 subjects The prevalence of acceptable echocardiograms ranged from less than 50 for those more than 80 years of age to more than 96 for subjects under 30 years of age A significant learning curve was apparent particularly in the older subjects more than 60 years of age for whom prevalence of acceptable echocardiograms rose from a minimum of 28 during the first 5 months of studies to a maximum of 74 to 81 during studies 2 years later The likelihood of unacceptable echocardiograms was slightly greater in men Obesity in subjects younger than 60 years of age lower vital capacity and overt cardiovascular disease were associated with unacceptable echocardiograms independent of age Consideration of these biases should aid in the interpretation and planning of epidemiologic and other studies using echocardiography
S993	Voice rehabilitation practices among head and neck surgeons were surveyed to determine the proportional contribution of various methods of speech support and the impact of recent developments in this field Of the 400 head and neck surgeons contacted 212 53 responded and 196 provided data Noninvasive methods of speech support continue to predominate in this country Esophageal speech is used by all surgeons in some of their patients The introduction of tracheoesophageal puncture techniques for prosthetic placement has added a new dimension to speech rehabilitation and is used almost 30 of the time by those who use it 88 of surgeons surveyed The proportional use of the most common methods of speech support is almost identical between head and neck surgeons of a general surgical background and otolaryngologists The incidence of total failures to achieve voice rehabilitation is less than 10
S994	Substance abuse in the workplace is a problem of enormous proportions Hospitals like other organizations must recognize the potential risks posed by substance abuse and effectively deal with the problem A nationwide study was conducted of hospital personnel managers attitudes toward drug abuse and mandatory drug testing The study focuses on the policies hospitals have formulated and reveals hospital administrators concerns over the legality of mandatory testing
S995	The object of this study was to determine the molecular species of verapamil Vp which is responsible for the negative inotropic activity of the drug Toward this end we developed a model system which allowed us to determine the concentrations of protonated and neutral Vp and four congeners in solution and bound to an amphiphilic interface We then determined the effect of Vp and these congeners on twitch tension in sheep trabecular muscle and correlated species abundance with biologic activity The cumulative log doseresponse curves of Vp acyanoVp and norVp were sigmoidal The concentrations of drug which were required to inhibit twitch tension by 50 IC50 were 1000  240 3350  620 and 7140  950 nM respectively mean  SD P less than 01 QuaternaryVp an amphiphilic nonionizable protonated derivative produced some nonspecific inhibition which never reached 50 TetrahydroxyVp a hydrophilic ionizable derivative was inactive Concentrations of the membranebound neutral form of Vp acyanoVp and norVp were comparable at their IC50 values 86  19 104  19 and 121  16 nM respectively mean  SD P NS In contrast the concentrations of the membranebound protonated form were significantly different and accounted for the apparent difference in the IC50 values Based on these data we conclude that 1 ionizability and amphiphilicity are required for the negative inotropic effects of verapamil acyanoVp and norVp 2 twitch tension correlates best with the concentration of the membranebound neutral form of each drug and 3 the potency differences between Vp acyanoVp and norVp as reflected by their IC50 values are apparent not real
S996	Technetium99m mercaptoacetyltriglycine MAG3 has recently been introduced as a new radiopharmaceutical for dynamic renal scintigraphy To elucidate the mechanism of renal excretion micropuncture experiments were performed in rat kidneys for direct measurements of glomerular filtration and tubular secretory capacity Fluid of Bowman space was collected from superficial glomeruli and analyzed for its contents of 99mTcMAG3 125Ihippurate and 3Hinulin during constant infusion of these compounds The ratio of activity of ultrafiltrate to that of arterial plasma was 023 for MAG3 068 for hippurate and 104 for inulin which demonstrates that the filtrated amount of MAG3 is only 23 of that of inulin presumably because of higher plasma protein binding which was also measured in vitro and found to be 80  15 for MAG3 and 32  2 for 125Ihippurate Proximal and distal tubules were also micropunctured and their tubular fluid as well as the final urine analyzed for the activity of hippurate and MAG3 The tubular fluid to plasma ratio values along the nephron and in the final urine were all lower for MAG3 than for hippurate indicating a lower secretory capacity From measurements of whole renal clearance GFR and plasma protein binding the filtered amount of MAG3 was 026 and of hippurate 087 mlming kidney weight p less than 0001 and the secreted amount 201 and 238 mlming kidney weight p less than 005 respectively We conclude that MAG3 is predominantly excreted by tubular secretion and that the lower renal clearance of MAG3 as compared with that of hippurate is a result both of a substantially decreased glomerular filtration and of a lower tubular secretion
S997	A simple instrument for measuring adductor pollicis tension in children has been devised The thumb sensor utilizes a thin conical rubber seal obtained from a 5 10 or 20 ml Becton Dickinson syringe A syringe barrel of similar size fixed at right angles to the sensor forms a handle for the fist The sensor is linked to a pressure transducer with noncompliant tubing Pressure output of the salinefilled system was found to be linearly related to the force exerted on each size of the sensor In 20 children aged two to eight years the device fitted in turn with the 5 10 and 20 ml syringe seal sensors gave trainoffour TOF ratios which showed close correlation coefficient r  096 093 095 and agreement regression slope b  097 095 098 with those of a force transducer Thus inspection of the displayed TOF pressure pulses gives a rapid and reliable estimate of neuromuscular blockade
S998	Vitamin A toxicity has been associated with alterations in mineral metabolism and may result in osteopenia fractures deformities and growth arrest The pathogenesis of the bone lesions that occur in vitamin A toxicity is however ill defined and was examined in the present study The administration of pharmacological doses of vitamin A to growing male rats resulted in weakness and spontaneous fractures Undecalcified bone histology of vitamin A toxic animals was characterized by increased bone resorption osteoclastosis a paucity of trabecular surfaces covered with osteoid and lesions which appear to be pathognomonic of hypervitaminosis A The serum calcium and magnesium levels of vitamin Atoxic animals were unremarkable but serum phosphate levels were significantly higher than control values Urinary hydroxyproline excretion reflected bone histology and was significantly increased in experimental rats Circulating levels of the potent bone resorbers PTH 125dihydroxyvitamin D and 25hydroxyvitamin D were however comparable in vitamin Atoxic and control animals suggesting a possible direct effect of vitamin A on bone Subsequently the effects of vitamin A retinol on in vitro collagen synthesis incorporation of 3Hproline into collagen and bone resorption 45Ca release from bone were examined using a fetal rat calvarial culture Retinol added to the culture medium for 2024 h in concentrations ranging from 0510 microgramsml selectively inhibited collagen synthesis in a dosedependent fashion Higher concentrations of retinol were toxic and resulted in a general inhibition of protein synthesis Bone resorption was stimulated by 05 and 25 microgramsml retinol We conclude that vitamin A toxicity in rats causes bone lesions the genesis of which can be explained at least in part by a direct effect of the vitamin on skeletal tissue
S999	We have used immunohistology and radioimmunoassay procedures to study Chromogranin A CgA in human neuroendocrine tumor cell lines especially small cell lung cancers SCLC By immunohistology CgA could be detected in 11 of 18 classical SCLC cell lines in a medullary thyroid carcinoma MTC cell line and in only one of 13 variant or nonSCLC cell lines By radioimmunoassay CgA could be detected in the cells and culture media of all of the classical SCLC cell lines tested Many of the classical SCLC cell lines also produced calcitonin CT These studies demonstrate that CgA production is a common feature of SCLC cell lines especially those with neuroendocrine characteristics
S1000	Different molecular species of cardiolipin were prepared from tissue of rats fed diets containing different oils The effects of these different species of cardiolipins on bovine heart cytochrome c oxidase activity were examined using reconstituted vesicles Cytochrome c oxidase was stimulated effectively by cardiolipin molecular species rich in linoleoyllinoleoyl species
S1001	The occurrence of mood changes in the postpartum period is common This presentation will discuss three cases of postpartum mood changes illustrating the normal changes depression with suicidal ideation requiring brief hospitalization and psychotic depression requiring intensive psychiatric treatment
S1002	We placed interrupted 90 nylon sutures across the grafthost interface of ten eyes with more than 5 diopters of keratometric cylinder after penetrating keratoplasty in order to steepen the flattest corneal meridian and reduce the amount of corneal cylinder Placement of compression sutures reduced corneal cylinder by an average of almost 6 diopters one week later Average corneal cylinder was 51 diopters nine to 12 months after surgery Bestcorrected visual acuity with spectacles improved by an average of two Snellen lines 2060 to 2040 and uncorrected visual acuity improved by an average of one line 20300 to 20200 There were no complications related to placement of the sutures This procedure provides a rapid and simple method for reducing astigmatism after penetrating keratoplasty
S1003	Biocompatibility is redefined as the quality of being mutually tolerant with life In so far as this represents a quality which is as likely to be achieved as is the alchemists dream of turning lead into gold a compromise approach is recommended It is suggested that all extracorporeal or body invasive procedures stimulate the inflammatory defense mechanism of the body by stimulating the monocyte to produce a family of polypeptides currently known collectively as Interleukin1 IL1 So far two dissimilar gene products have been cloned and there are probably more The IL1 group of polypeptides possess hormonal functions which orchestrate nearly every instrument of the bodys defense system Inducers of IL1 are present in dialysate and include bacterial pyrogen and acetate In addition bacterial cell wall glycoprotein may be cleaved into muramyl dipeptides by the release of granulocyte lysozyme at the membrane interface Muramyl dipeptides have been found in CAPD drain fluid and are more potent inducers of IL1 than endotoxin Membrane activation of the fifth component of complement with the release of C5a will also induce monocytes to produce IL1 The consequences of repeated stimulation of the acute phase response are undesirable and may include muscle wasting osteopenia and bone cysts Shrinking man syndrome fibrosis of scapulohumeral joints and the carpaltunnel syndrome These latter lesions are often associated with deposition of amyloid fibrils related to beta 2 microglobulin Efforts to reduce these complications are urgently requiredABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S1004	Studies in twokidneyone clip hypertensive rats have demonstrated that longterm treatment with enalapril induced regression of cardiac hypertrophy but the cardiac contractile response to betaadrenergic stimulation remained depressed In the present study we evaluate the contractile response to betaadrenergic stimulation of isolated papillary muscle in normal rats with isoproterenol 1011 M to 104 M in the presence of enalaprilic acid 106 M or 104 M or enalaprilic acid 104 M and angiotensin II 106 M Myocardial contractility was characterized by maximal developed tension and maximal rate of rise of tension T and the relaxant effect of isoproterenol by the ratio of T and the maximal velocity of relaxation TTT ratio The rest tension gmm2 and the crosssectional area mm2 were similar in all the muscles studied Enalaprilic acid either 106 M or 104 M in the bath did not induce any change in contractile and relaxation parameters The increment in T and T expressed as percentage in response to cumulative doses of isoproterenol 1011 M to 104 M was significantly depressed in the presence of enalaprilic acid 104 M when compared with control hearts in which only vehicle was added before isoproterenol p less than 005 The addition of angiotensin II after enalaprilic acid 104 M did not normalize the response in T and T Enalaprilic acid diminishes the contractile response of the papillary muscle to betaadrenergic stimulation The inhibition of the local angiotensin II does not seem to be involved in this result
S1005	Wholelung lavage under hyperbaric oxygen conditions was performed in two patients suffering from severe respiratory insufficiency in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis Under these conditions gas exchange was maintained and the mixed venous partial pressure of oxygen and oxygen saturation showed increases to acceptable levels This enabled us to limit the FIO2 in order to extend the oxygen tolerance and to perform lavage procedures more effectively Both patients showed a very significant improvement of their clinical course and we conclude that elective use of hyperbaric oxygen in unilateral lung lavages should be considered in these severe cases
S1006	The effects of motor denervation on levels of phosphorylase kinase isozymes and phosphorylase were investigated in rat epitrochlearis hemidiaphragm and soleus muscles Amounts of the proteins were measured after quantitative immunoprecipitation and found to be decreased by as much as 70 2 weeks after denervation Unexpectedly denervation had little if any effect on the relative proportions of the two phosphorylase kinase isozymes Phosphorylase and phosphorylase kinase were decreased by essentially the same extent after denervation and the effects of denervation were comparable in all three muscles The decreases in these enzymes explain at least in part the marked alterations in glycogen metabolism that occur after motor denervation
S1007	The present work was undertaken to determine the effect of atmospheric pressure ranging from a high altitude of 4300 m above sea level or 06 atmospheres absolute ATA to depths of 10 m deep or 2 ATA on the critical water temperature Tcw defined as the lowest water temperature a subject can tolerate at rest for 2 h without shivering of the unprotected subject during water immersion Nine healthy males wearing only shorts were subjected to immersion to the neck in water at 06 1 and 2 ATA while resting for 2 h Continuous measurements included esophageal Tes and skin Tsk temperatures direct heat loss from the skin Htissue and insulation of the tissue Itissue The Tcw was significantly higher at 06 ATA than 1 and 2 ATA however Tcw at 1 ATA was identical to that at 2 ATA The metabolic heat production remained unchanged among the pressures During the 2h immersion in Tcw Tes was identical among all atmospheric pressures however Tsk was significantly higher P less than 005 at 06 ATA and was identical between 1 and 2 ATA The overall mean Itissue was near maximal during immersion in Tcw in each pressure and no difference was detected among the pressures However Itissue at the acral extremities arm hand and foot decreased significantly at 06 ATA and subsequently heat loss from these parts was increased which elevated an extremitytotrunk heat loss ratio to 14 at 06 ATA from 11 at 1 and 2 ATAABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S1008	We studied one hundred patients with suspected temporomandibular joint TMJ arthropathy in whom 64 also complained of headache andor facial pain using high field surface coil magnetic resonance MR imaging and found that headache and facial pain are commonly observed in association with inflammatory arthropathy of the TMJ Each patient complained of pain andor tenderness localized to the immediate vicinity of at least one TMJ Pathologic joint effusion was demonstrated by MR in 88 of the painful joints studied Significant meniscus displacement with or without meniscus deformity and alteration of intrinsic signal intensity was present in 94 of the 100 painful joints examined Fascial inflammation and atrophy of the ipsilateral muscles of mastication were observed occasionally with painful joints There were no mechanical TMJ symptoms such as joint clicking crepitus or locking in 14 internally deranged and painful joints 12 of which exhibited joint effusion and local inflammation At least 80 patients described occlusal changes within 12 months of imaging 28 of the pathologic joints in the series underwent subsequent meniscectomy including routine histologic evaluation of surgical material We conclude that internal derangement and inflammation of the TMJ should be considered in patients with unexplained headache andor facial pain even if mechanical TMJ symptoms are absent
S1009	As the proportion of elderly persons in the population increases physicians will more frequently see patients with the oral lesions that commonly occur in this group Periodontal disease represents the most common cause of tooth loss in the elderly Dentures can create several problems including traumatic ulceration denture stomatitis inflammatory papillary hyperplasia and epulis fissurata Erythroplakia rather than leukoplakia is the most common precursor of oral carcinoma in elderly persons
S1010	Thalamic neurons undergo a shift from tonic to phasic burst firing upon hyperpolarization This state transition results from deinactivation of a regenerative depolarizing event referred to as the lowthreshold spike Isolated adult guinea pig thalamic dorsal lateral geniculate neurons exhibited lowthreshold spikes that could be blocked by low concentrations of nickel but were unaffected by the dihydropyridine nimodipine Wholecell voltageclamp recordings from these cells demonstrated a lowthreshold rapidly inactivating T Ca2 current that manifested similar voltage dependency and time course as the lowthreshold spike Like lowthreshold spikes the Ttype Ca2 current was eliminated by nickel but was unaffected by nimodipine In thalamic neurons Ttype Ca2 channels underlie the lowthreshold spike and therefore play a critical role in regulating the firing pattern of these cells
S1011	In a study of 637 femoral heads removed surgically because of osteoarthritis the wear was predominantly on the posterior half in 132 and was more than twothirds posterior in 75 Wear was more than twothirds anterior in 378 In 36 heads from patients with rheumatoid arthritis the wear was predominant posterior in 278 No anatomical reason was found for these marked asymmetries which from their position could not possibly be the result of simple weight bearing The finding underlines the importance of muscular action in the causation of wear
S1012	Iv lignocaine has been used with varying success to attenuate the cardiovascular responses to laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation We determined the optimal time of administration in 45 ASA I and II Chinese patients premedicated with morphine and hyoscine and anaesthetized with thiopentone and suxamethonium Patients were allocated randomly to a control group or three treatment groups to receive lignocaine 15 mg kg1 iv 1 2 or 3 min before laryngoscopy Analysis of variance for measured and derived cardiovascular variables failed to show any significant difference between any of the groups
S1013	Calcium influx is often an essential intermediate step for the release of neurotransmitter However some retinal neurons appear to release transmitter by a mechanism that does not require calcium influx It was uncertain whether depolarization released calcium from an intracellular store or released transmitter by a mechanism that does not require calcium The possibility that voltage and not calcium can regulate the release of transmitter was studied with pairs of solitary retinal neurons Horizontal and bipolar cells were isolated from fish retinas and juxtaposed in culture Communication between them was studied with electrophysiological methods A horizontal cell released its neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid when depolarized during conditions that buffered the internal calcium concentration and prohibited calcium entry The speed and amount of material released were sufficient for a contribution to synaptic transmission
S1014	In asymptomatic patients with essential hypertension electrocardiographic changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia can be elicited by rapid pressure lowering or by pronounced coronary arteriolar dilation The aim of this study was to assess whether dipyridamole infusion might induce ischemiclike electrocardiographic changes in asymptomatic essential hypertensive patients and to describe the clinical and echocardiographic correlates possibly associated with this response We therefore studied a control group of 20 normotensive individuals and a group of 28 asymptomatic patients with mildtomoderate essential hypertension All underwent dipyridamoleechocardiography testing 12lead electrocardiogram and twodimensional echocardiographic monitoring with dipyridamole infusion 084 mgkg over 10 No patient showed transient regional dyssynergy during dipyridamole infusion None of the normotensive and 10 of 28 of the hypertensive participants had horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression more than 01 mV during dipyridamole 0 versus 36 p less than 001 Hypertensive patients with responders n  10 and without nonresponders n  18 ST segment depression showed similar values of percent fractional shortening in baseline conditions 32  5 versus 33  6 p  NS and at peak dipyridamole infusion 45  8 versus 43  5 p  NS The peak early to peak late velocity ratio values evaluated from transmitral flow tracings by Doppler technique were also similar in baseline conditions 086  014 versus 094  030 p  NS and at peak dipyridamole 072  015 versus 078  032 p  NSABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
S1015	The left renal vein can be ligated during aortic operation to attain better access to the perirenal aorta This maneuver has been considered safe with a low incidence of postoperative renal complications This study was done to evaluate the risk of left renal vein ligation and its influence on renal function in patients with elective resection of abdominal aortic aneurysms The records of 332 patients undergoing elective repair of abdominal aortic aneurysms during a five year period were reviewed The clinical and operative data of patients who had left renal vein ligation and those who did not were similar Left renal vein ligation was not associated with an increased mortality rate but was strongly associated with an increase in serum creatinine level and a clinical diagnosis of postoperative azotemia Nine of 13 patients who had left renal vein ligation had postoperative azotemia compared with 21 of 319 patients without left renal vein ligation p less than 0001 The mean change of preoperative and postoperative creatinine value was an increase of 192 milligrams per deciliter in patients with left renal vein ligation in contrast with 026 milligram per deciliter in patients without ligation p less than 000075 Thus ligation of the left renal vein increases the risk of postoperative renal complications and its use should be selective
S1016	Two copies of structurally related genes CAH1 and CAH2 for carbonic anhydrase EC 4211 were found to be tandemly clustered on the Chlamydomonas reinhardtii genome The previously isolated cDNA clones for carbonic anhydrase polypeptides were derived from the upstream gene CAH1 which has 10 introns in its coding region The downstream gene CAH2 also has 10 introns at positions identical to those of CAH1 Although amino acid sequences deduced from the two genes showed 918 identity partial sequences of the authentic enzyme isolated from airinduced cells were identical only to those of the CAH1 product Northern hybridization using genespecific probes showed that the level of 20kilobase CAH1 mRNA increased in response to a decrease in CO2 concentration in the presence of light The CAH1 mRNA did not accumulate when CO2 was lowered in the dark In contrast the level of 20kilobase CAH2 mRNA decreased in response to lowering of CO2 and increased upon transfer to the highCO2 condition in light The decrease of CAH2 mRNA under the lowCO2 condition was not observed in the dark The fully induced mRNA level was much higher for CAH1 than for CAH2 These results indicate that CAH1 is a gene coding for the major periplasmic carbonic anhydrase whose level of transcript is rapidly induced under the lowCO2 condition in the presence of light and that CAH2 may encode another periplasmic isozyme which is made under the highCO2 condition
S1017	Softtissue sarcomas remain relatively uncommon neoplasms but they present major problems for both the patient and clinician The identification of prognostic variables based on both clinical and histologic factors has allowed comparisons to be made between various therapeutic regimens In extremity sarcoma a more conservative operation utilizing adjuvant radiotherapy has decreased the need for radical surgery and maximized function without loss of survival benefit The identification of highrisk groups that is patients with highgrade large lesions has highlighted the inadequacies of treatment in some areas Similarly this has led to more aggressive and innovative developmental programs The progress understanding and therapeutic management of extremity lesions have not been matched in visceral and retroperitoneal tumors Current efforts are directed at more appropriate use of radical surgery maximizing conservative functionsparing operations with the use of adjuvant local therapy and development of new regimens directed at prevention and treatment of metastatic disease
S1018	Molecule CD28 Tp44 is expressed on the surface of majority of human T cells and has been implicated to play an active role in the regulation of T cell growth The present study examines the effect of antibody binding to the CD28 molecule during T cell activation AntiCD28 but not isotypematched antiCD5 mAb consistently augmented antiCD3induced and IL2induced T cell proliferation and subsequent release of soluble CD25 molecule When added together mAb antiCD28 and antiCD5 acted synergistically to cause 2 to 7fold enhancement of T cell activation induced by antiCD3 mAb or IL2 with no effect on the development of nonMHCrestricted IL2activated killer T cells In contrast alloantigeninduced T cell proliferation soluble CD25 release and the subsequent development of CTL were all inhibited by antiCD28 mAb Moreover alloantigeninduced proliferative response of both CD4 and CD8 T cells was inhibited by antiCD28 without affecting the cytolytic effect of CTL Because valency of antiCD28 binding has been implicated as an important factor in signal transduction this was explored in the allogeneic MLR by using Fab and Fab2 fragments of antiCD28 mAb and antimouse kappa mAb The inhibitory effect of antiCD28 mAb in the MLR was reversed by crosslinking of antiCD28 mAb with antimouse kappa mAb In addition crosslinking of the CD28 molecule on alloactivated T lymphoblasts but not that on resting T cells with antiCD28 and antimouse kappa induced their proliferation in the absence of the priming alloantigen These results indicate that stimulatory or inhibitory signals delivered through the CD28 molecule are determined by the degree of crosslinking of this molecule In addition these results also suggest that Aginduced CD3TCRmediated T cell responses are more dependent on signals delivered through the CD28 molecule than those induced with antiCD3 and thus these results have implications for potential use of antiCD28 in sustained propagation of Agspecific T cells
S1019	One hundred fiftyfive patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the pyriform sinus were treated with curative intent at the University of Florida between 1962 and 1984 All patients were staged according to the AJCC staging system and had a minimum 2year followup 84 had at least 5 years of followup The locoregional control rates the incidence of treatmentrelated complications and survival rates are presented for radiotherapy as well as for surgery with or without adjuvant irradiation
S1020	The balloontipped embolectomy catheter is widely utilized in the treatment of arterial thromboemboli significantly improving mortality and limb salvage rates However early and late complications related to cathetertip injury and balloon trauma continue to occur and compromise the results of surgical intervention Myointimal hyperplasia is an example of an unusual late complication induced by balloonrelated arterial wall trauma Myointimal hyperplasia is a commonly recognized healing response of the arterial wall to endothelial injury but is rarely reported after ballooncatheter thromboembolectomy The extensive nature of the injury increases the incidence of limb loss The pathophysiologic nature of this process is reviewed and pertinent structural details such as intimal thickening and disruption of the internal elastic lamina are presented The pathogenesis of myointimal hyperplasia suggests guidelines for catheter use during embolectomy that may further reduce the incidence of this unusual complication
S1021	Isocarboxazid and placebo were evaluated in 130 anxious depressives Drug was superior to placebo on depression anxiety interpersonal sensitivity and global measures and on symptoms of hostility anxiety obsessiveness and psychologicalcognitive components of depression There were no significant differences between treatment effects on psychomotor and typical vegetative symptoms Isocarboxazid was more effective than placebo in major but not in minor depression It was significantly more effective in depression classified as endogenous depression or melancholia by various diagnostic criteria Drug was more effective than placebo in atypical depression with vegetative reversal and in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale BPRSderived profiles of anxious and hostile depression there were no drugplacebo differences in atypical depression without vegetative reversal or in BPRS retarded and agitatedexcited depression Interpersonal sensitivity emerged as an important drugresponsive dimension
S1022	The recommendations of the US Preventive Services Task Force are reviewed in regard to screening for breast cancer In contradistinction to those issued by some other national organizations screening for breast cancer using mammography at ages 4049 is not recommended It is concluded that the scientific evidence is insufficient at present to recommend mammography screening for women aged 4049 The recommendations of the task force are all women over age 40 should receive an annual breast examination all women should have mammography every one or two years beginning at age 50 and concluding at approximately age 75 unless disease has been detected and it may be prudent to begin mammography at an earlier age for women at high risk of breast cancer These recommendations are appropriate in light of the available evidence though at present there is no evidence that clinical examination of the breasts at any age reduces breast cancer mortality the upper age beyond which breast cancer screening no longer has a significant effect in reducing breast cancer mortality is unknown and there is no evidence that women at high risk for breast cancer benefit to a different degree from screening than women not at high risk
S1023	Two patients who had undergone emergency tracheal intubation developed signs of aspiration of ingested food Nasendoscopy demonstrated supraglottic anaesthesia which recovered from the laryngeal margins in towards the vocal cords It is assumed that this was caused by a neuropraxia of the internal branch of the superior laryngeal nerve presumably as a result of trauma related to intubation
