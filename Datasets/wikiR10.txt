R589	78910	A wave function or wavefunction also named a state function in quantum mechanics describes the quantum state of a system of one or more particles and contains all the information about the system Quantities associated with measurements like the average momentum of a particle are derived from the wavefunction Thus it is a central quantity in quantum mechanics The most common symbols for a wave function are the Greek letters u03C8 or u03A8 lower case and capital psi The Schr u00F6dinger equation determines how the wave function evolves over time that is the wavefunction is the solution of the Schr u00F6dinger equation The wave function behaves qualitatively like other waves like water waves or waves on a string because the Schr u00F6dinger equation is mathematically a type of wave equation This explains the name wave function and gives rise to wave u2013particle duality The wave function for a given system does not have a unique representation Most commonly it is taken to be a function of all the position coordinates of the particles and time that is the wavefunction is in position space However we could also consider a wave function in momentum space a function of all the momenta of the particles and time instead In general the wave function of a system is a function of continuous and discrete variables characterizing the system s degrees of freedom and there is one wavefunction for the entire system not a separate wavefunction for each particle in the system Elementary particles like electrons have spin and the wavefunction must include this fundamental property as an intrinsic degree of freedom The wave function is spinorial for fermions namely particles with half integer spin 1 2 3 2 5 2 or tensorial for bosons particles with integer spin 0 1 2 3 In most treatments of quantum mechanics the wavefunction is complex valued In one important interpretation of quantum mechanics called the Copenhagen interpretation the modulus squared of the wavefunction u03C8 2 is a real number interpreted as the probability density of finding a particle in a given place at a given time if the particle s position is to be measured Since the wavefunction is complex valued only its relative phase and relative magnitude can be measured It does not directly tell anything about the magnitudes or directions of measurable observables one has to apply quantum operators to the wave function u03C8 and find the eigenvalues which correspond to sets of possible results of measurement However complex numbers are not necessarily used in all treatments Louis de Broglie in his later years proposed a real valued wave function connected to the complex wave function by a proportionality constant and developed the de Broglie u2013Bohm theory The unit of measurement for u03C8 depends on the system For one particle in three dimensions its units are length u22123 2 These unusual units are required so that an integral of u03C8 2 over a region of three dimensional space is a unitless probability the probability that the particle is in that region For different numbers of particles and or dimensions the units may be different and can be found by dimensional analysis

R788	738047	Katarche u03BA u03B1 u03C4 u03B1 u03C1 u03C7 u03AE is an ancient Greek word meaning a beginning or inception One of the older applications of the term was within the context of religious rituals to refer to the moment when the sacrifice was first offered or when the beginning or inception of the sacrifice took place See Homer Odyssey Chapter III The main application of the term katarche in the Hellenistic and Roman period was to the branch of astrology now called electional astrology or the art of choosing an auspicious time to begin a venture or an enterprise Also included in this practice were techniques for analyzing an astrological chart drawn up for the beginning moment of an event that had already taken place in order to foretell the likely success of a venture or the timing of its development Recently in the late 20th century some astrologers began to extend the use of the word katarche to interrogations or horary astrology where a chart is cast for the moment that a question is posed to an astrologer According to this modern interpretation there is a fluid connection between the notions of electional and horary astrology This view which is primarily advocated by Geoffrey Cornelius is that the origins of the concept and core meaning of the term katarche lie in the ritual sacrificial and divinitory connotations of the term and that the later application of the term in the Hellenistic and Roman periods strictly to elections and inceptions were a result of some sort of decay in the understanding of the term

R980	398621	Miyabi u96C5 is one of the traditional Japanese aesthetic ideals though not as prevalent as Iki or Wabi sabi In modern Japanese the word is usually translated as elegance refinement or courtliness and sometimes refers to a heart breaker The ideal posed by the word demanded the elimination of anything that was absurd or vulgar and the polishing of manners diction and feelings to eliminate all roughness and crudity so as to achieve the highest grace It expressed that sensitivity to beauty which was the hallmark of the Heian era Miyabi is often closely connected to the notion of Mono no aware a bittersweet awareness of the transience of things and thus it was thought that things in decline showed a great sense of miyabi An example of this would be one of a lone cherry tree The tree would soon lose its flowers and would be stripped of everything that made it beautiful and so it showed not only mono no aware but also miyabi in the process Adherents to the ideals of miyabi strove to rid the world of crude forms or aesthetics and emotions that were common in artworks of the period such as those contained in the Man y u014Dsh u016B the oldest extant collection of Japanese poetry The Man y u014Dsh u016B contained poems by people of every walk of life many of which stood in stark contrast to the sensibilities of miyabi For example one poem in the collection likened a woman s hair to snail innards The ideals of miyabi stood firmly against the use of metaphors such as this Furthermore appreciation of miyabi and its ideal was used as a marker of class differences It was believed that only members of the upper class the courtiers could truly appreciate the workings of miyabi Miyabi in fact limited how art and poems could be created Miyabi tried to stay away from the rustic and crude and in doing so prevented the traditionally trained courtiers from expressing real feelings in their works In later years miyabi and its aesthetic were replaced by ideals inspired by Zen Buddhism such as Wabi sabi Yuugen and Iki The characters of the classic eleventh century Japanese novel The Tale of Genji by Lady Murasaki provide many excellent examples of the true nature of miyabi
