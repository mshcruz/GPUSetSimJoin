R0	Cardiovascular conditions account for more medical costs than any other diagnostic category in the United States Increasingly economic constraints will shape policy related to health care and research Hypertension is the most common cardiovascular condition and despite low unit health care costs the aggregate costs are considerable However the unit and aggregate costs of the complications of hypertension are fourfold greater and in this economic perspective aggressive approaches are warranted to prevent complications Treatment and research strategies should be identified that could have considerable potential economic impact Several strategies are suggested as a prospective guide to policy development Economic considerations will be important and should be incorporated in the planning of hypertension care and research
R1	PURPOSE Digoxin is the third most commonly prescribed drug yet limited information exists about its use in outpatients Therefore 242 medical outpatients receiving digoxin at our hospital were studied to evaluate the appropriateness of its use defined by 1 current or past supraventricular arrhythmias andor 2 left ventricular systolic dysfunction ejection fraction less than 45 percent PATIENTS AND METHODS Charts of 242 patients receiving digoxin were obtained The patients were divided into groups based upon their physicians stated indication for digoxin therapy Patients with only a clinical diagnosis of congestive heart failure CHF underwent echocardiography or radionuclide angiography to quantify left ventricular systolic function Those with documented supraventricular arrhythmias andor those with confirmed left ventricular systolic dysfunction were classified as appropriate candidates for digoxin RESULTS Ninetyfive percent of patients received digoxin for appropriate indications 75 percent had confirmed supraventricular arrhythmias 27 percent also had CHF and 20 percent with normal sinus rhythm had documented systolic dysfunction However physicians had difficulty in the clinical assessment of left ventricular function 18 percent of patients with sinus rhythm and CHF by the Framingham scoring system and 20 percent of those with supraventricular arrhythmias and CHF had preserved systolic function An S3 was present in 15 percent of patients with preserved ejection fraction and CHF and in 69 percent with low ejection fraction hypertension was significantly more common in the former group Noninvasive assessment of systolic function was obtained in 97 percent of patients independent of this study yet some patients without supraventricular arrhythmias and with documented preservation of systolic function continued to receive the drug CONCLUSION Noninvasive assessment of left ventricular function which appears to have become routine is of value in the appropriate utilization of digoxin since clinicians assessment of left ventricular function may be inaccurate Physicians also do not always discontinue digoxin therapy when indicated
R2	Last spring executives at Charles E Still Osteopathic Hospital Jefferson City MO distributed individual practice profiles to each member of the medical staff The physicians threw the computer printouts into the nearest trash can However things have improved since then and the physicians eventually became intrigued by the data Hospital CEOs nationwide can identify with this experience According to Hospitals survey data 51 percent of hospital executives are generating practice profiles for medical staff members but of this number only 55 percent are sharing the data with the physicians The question is Whats the best way to collect and share this profile information This issues cover story looks at how several hospital executives answered this question
R3	Six longterm nursing home residents who experienced fractures of the long bones in the absence of obvious trauma are described All patients had been essentially nonweightbearing for at least 2 years before the episode Four patients experienced fractures on more than one occasion There was no evidence of physical abuse in any of these of patients indeed evidence against abuse was fairly good Nonetheless physical abuse was alleged by the patients families in four of the cases Long bone fracture in the absence of trauma in patients after prolonged bed rest has been well described in the radiologic and orthopedic literature but not previously in geriatrics It is important that this phenomenon be recognized lest all unexplained fractures in nursing home patients automatically be taken as evidence of abuse or neglect
R4	The plasma concentrations of oxipurinol the chief metabolite of allopurinol were studied in 66 patients with gout in whom the dose of allopurinol varied between 100 and 400 mg per day Renal function ranged from normal to moderately impaired Plasma oxipurinol concentrations correlated directly with both allopurinol dosage and with renal glomerular function as reflected by the plasma creatinine concentration Plasma oxipurinol concentrations between 30 and 100 mumoll were generally effective in controlling hyperuricaemia However oxipurinol concentrations usually rose above this range if the daily dose of allopurinol exceeded 300 mg in patients with plasma creatinine concentrations of 02 mmoll or more In patients with normal renal function a rise of the plasma xanthine concentration to between 6 and 9 mumoll suggested a satisfactory degree of xanthine oxidase inhibition These measurements are particularly useful in patients who are still hyperuricaemic despite the usual doses of allopurinol
R5	Serum carnitine levels have been measured in 178 samples from 75 normal volunteers We report a wide range of values 1070 mumolliter and 874 mumolliter for free and acetylated carnitine respectively and a distinct difference between the ranges for males and females p less than 0001 There is also substantial seemingly random fluctuation in any one individuals levels when measured serially over several weeks
R6	Almost equivalent intravenous iodine doses of the three new lowosmolar contrast media ioxaglate Hexabrix iopamidol Niopam and iohexol Omnipaque have been compared for image quality on the intravenous urogram Generally good radiographic images were obtained Iohexol gave better results for the nephrogram and pelvicalyceal distension compared with the other contrast media but only the nephrogram results were statistically significant Pyelographic density and ureteric distension and density were similar with all three contrast media In patients where lowosmolality contrast media need to be used for intravenous urography we suggest that iohexol gives the best radiographic images Other factors such as cost and the relative incidence of sideeffects of the lowosmolar contrast media also need to be taken into consideration
R7	PURPOSE In Japan early gastric cancer has an excellent survival rate In the United States the disease is less well understood and it is viewed more pessimistically although we have previously shown in a small series of patients good shortterm survival rates in early gastric cancer as compared with advanced gastric cancer Our purpose in this study was to determine if the incidence of early gastric cancer and the associated survival rate has changed over a 24year period PATIENTS AND METHODS From the records at the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center 549 patients were identified who underwent gastric resection for cancer between 1960 and 1984 69 of whom had early gastric cancer Survival data were obtained in 63 patients A comparison of survival rates was conducted between patients with early gastric cancer and the 1980 census figures RESULTS Over the 24year period the total number of resections for gastric cancer at our institution declined However the percentage of gastric resections that satisfied the Japanese criteria for early gastric cancer increased from 9 percent between 1960 to 1974 to 17 percent between 1975 to 1984 p less than 005 Of the 69 early gastric cancers 35 percent involved the mucosa whereas in 65 percent the malignancy invaded the submucosa Twentyeight percent had lymph node involvement For the patients for whom survival data were available survival was better than the 1980 census p less than 005 The adjusted fiveyear survival rate was 97 percent Neither submucosal invasion nor lymph node involvement altered survival Patients with type III early cancers ulcerated however had a significantly greater survival rate than patients with type I polypoid early cancers p less than 005 CONCLUSION Early gastric cancer is being diagnosed with increasing frequency and has an excellent survival rate These findings are similar to the Japanese experience and argue for an ongoing aggressive approach to endoscopic biopsy of gastric lesions
R8	Ten proteins that span a wide range of phosphorescence lifetimes were examined for sensitivity to quenching by four agents of disparate chemical nature The results show that quenching efficiency is relatively independent of the quencher and is highly correlated with depth of burial of the phosphorescent tryptophan The bimolecular quenching rate constants kq measured for the different proteins spanning 5 orders of magnitude in kq are found to decrease exponentially with the distance r of the tryptophan in angstroms from the protein surfaceie kq  Aexprrho where A contains a geometrical factor dependent on tryptophan burial and surface geometry corrected Theoretical analysis shows that this behavior can be expected for an electronexchange reaction between the buried tryptophans and quenchers in solution in the rapid diffusion limit Therefore the results obtained provide evidence for an exponential dependence of electrontransfer rate on distance in a protein environment and evaluate the distance parameter rho for electron transfer through the general protein matrix at 10 A For a unimolecular donoracceptor pair with ket  koexprrho ko approximately 109 sec1
R9	Sixtytwo women with unexplained infertility were studied Fifteen group 1 had timed intrauterine insemination IUI 25 group 2 were treated by Pergonal Serono Laboratories Ltd Welwyn Garden City England superovulation and 22 group 3 underwent Pergonal superovulation combined with IUI Where Pergonal treatment was followed by insemination a significantly greater pregnancy rate per cycle P less than 005 was achieved whether this group of patients was compared with those treated by IUI alone or with those treated with Pergonal alone Moreover the pregnancy rate in group 3 was comparable to that reported following gamete intrafallopian transfer GIFT The authors therefore suggest this form of treatment for patients with unexplained infertility prior to their referral to the more invasive procedure of GIFT
R10	Two patients with surgically resected biliary cystadenocarcinoma are presented Both were asymptomatic and the cancer was incidentally found by ultrasonography US In the first case a huge multilocular tumor 21 X 15 cm in diameter having many papillary projections and septa within it and small daughter lesions occupied both the right anterior and left medial areas of the liver They were clearly demonstrated on US and computed tomography CT Angiography disclosed tumor vessels in some area of the lesion these features strongly suggested cystadenocarcinoma The second case had a solid mass 7 X 7 cm in the left hepatic lobe in which many septal structures within the lesion were seen on enhanced CT and light dot like stains were recognized on angiography The former findings coincided with the internal gross feature of the resected specimen Both patients are doing well 8 months and 1 year and 6 months after operation respectively
R11	Estimates of instrumentspecific analytical performance for measurement of four chemistry analytes calcium cholesterol creatinine and glucose were derived from 21 quality control programs that utilized the College of American Pathologists Quality Assurance Service and from 12 College of American Pathologists Comprehensive Chemistry Survey sets The quality controlderived estimates of analytical bias were larger and leveldependent when compared with the survey results Possible explanations for these differences include matrix effects due to glycol stabilization of the control materials studied and analyst bias when testing survey specimens A number of instruments from the Quality Assurance Service pools failed to meet the allowable analytical error goals for calcium and creatinine that serve as the basis for the fixed limits evaluation criteria of the survey program The methods for glucose analysis met the prescribed evaluation limits Cholesterol analyses need significant improvement to meet the analytical requirements of longterm testing of individuals
R12	Autonomous colony formation is a frequent event in erythroleukemia In 13 cases of early erythroid leukemias we investigated whether erythropoietin Epo autocrine stimulation was responsible for the growth factor autonomy Epo transcripts were detected by Northern blotting in cells from one patient These cells also expressed an Epo receptor 1000 receptors per cell with a 420pM affinity and Epo was detected in the supernatant of cultured cells In 8 of the 13 cases Epo transcripts were revealed by the polymerase chain reaction ranging from 05 to 500 copies per cell In situ hybridization proved that these Epo transcripts were present in the blast cells No Epo gene abnormalities were detected by Southern blotting In two cases leukemic cells were grown in the presence of Eponeutralizing antibodies or Epo antisense oligomers In one case the antibody significantly reduced autonomous growth In contrast the antibody had no effect in the second case in which blast cells transcribed the Epo gene at a low level However Epo antisense oligomers partially inhibited autonomous growth This inhibition was reversed by addition of exogenous Epo Overall these results suggest that an extracellular or intracellular autocrine Epo stimulation occurs in some cases of erythroid malignancies
R13	Measurement of transcutaneous oxygen pressure TCPO2 is an established and noninvasive way of assessing cutaneous hypoxia Since the degree of oxygenation modulates fibroblast growth and synthesis we investigated the presence of cutaneous hypoxia in patients with systemic sclerosis SS We measured TCPO2 of the involved skin of the dorsal aspect of the forearm in 33 patients with SS and 16 control individuals normal subjects and patients with Raynauds disease The degree of forearm skin thickness was assessed clinically as mild moderate or severe The TCPO2 measurements were obtained at a sensor temperature of 44 degrees C which causes maximal vasodilation and eliminates the variables associated with vascular tone Measurements were recorded while patients were breathing room air or 31 oxygen delivered by a Ventimask system Baxter Healthcare Ocala Fla We also measured the TCPO2 of the medial aspect of the arm when this site was uninvolved We found that sclerodermatous skin is hypoxic when compared with the uninvolved skin of patients with SS or control individuals The TCPO2 values were indirectly related to skin thickness thus patients whose skin was severely thickened had the lowest TCPO2 values There was no correlation of TCPO2 values with pulmonary function tests or arterial oxygen pressure The TCPO2 levels of patients with Raynauds disease did not differ from other control individuals The administration of oxygen increased TCPO2 readings in patients with SS to normal values We conclude that the thickened skin of patients with SS is hypoxic and suggest that TCPO2 measurements may be helpful in objectively assessing the degree of skin thickness The hypoxia demonstrated in SS skin may play a role in the modulation of dermal fibroblast proliferation and synthetic activity
R14	The contribution of amino acid transport across the bloodbrain barrier toward the concentration of brain 5hydroxyindoles serotonin and 5hydroxyindole acetic acid 5HIAA was investigated Several amino acids were individually supplemented to a 5 whole egg protein diet Close correlation between serum tryptophan brain tryptophan and 5hydroxyindoles were observed regardless of diet fed When a large neutral amino acid LNAA such as methionine threonine leucine or phenylalanine was added to the control diet brain 5hydroxyindole concentration was lower than when the control diet was fed however when tryptophan was added brain 5hydroxyindole concentration was significantly higher Lysine supplementation did not affect brain 5hydroxyindole concentration Leucine supplementation caused a lower tyrosine concentration in hypothalamus than the control diet but phenylalanine supplementation caused higher hypothalamus level of tyrosine There was no correlation between tyrosine and norepinephrine concentrations in hypothalamus norepinephrine turnover might also be changed by the nutritional state These observations indicate that the supplementation of an amino acid at two or fourfold of the requirement to a low protein diet can generate major changes in the concentrations of neurotransmitters in rats
R15	Twentytwo patients with epidural migration of cervical disc fragments were reviewed Disc sequestrations can migrate to the anterior posterior and lateral aspects of the spinal canal and are divided into four types according to their localizations Those migrating to the anterior or posterior surface of the spinal canal causing myelopathy were removed through either an anterior or posterior route Removal of lateral sequestration by uncoforaminotomy provided full recovery for all patients with radiculopathy and dropattacks The number of disc sequestrations was not always one three fragments were present in three patients and two fragments in five patients Various routes combined with other approaches were indicated to eliminate completely the freely migrating disc sequestra
R16	To determine whether systemic administration of antibiotics may eliminate or reduce the need for tympanomastoid surgery in chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma we undertook a randomized prospective study comparing three regimens 1 daily suction and debridement with intravenous administration of mezlocillin until 3 days after the discharge stopped 2 daily suction and debridement with intravenous use of ceftazidime until 3 days after the discharge stopped and 3 daily suction and debridement without antibiotics No topical antimicrobial agents were used during the study Fiftyone patients were included and 48 children completed the study The duration of discharge from the ear before treatment was 2 to 123 months median 20 months In 26 patients 51 the disease was bilateral Aerobic cultures obtained with the AldenSenturia middle ear aspirator yielded Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 98 enteric gramnegative bacilli in 33 staphylococci in 25 and Haemophilus influenzae in 12 The first 33 patients were randomly assigned to one of the three regimens In the 21 patients treated with suction and antibiotics either mezlocillin or ceftazidime the discharge stopped completely versus in only 1 8 of 12 patients in the suctiononly regimen p less than 001 Therefore the following 18 patients were randomly assigned to one of only two groups which included the two suctionandantibiotic regimens In all patients treated initially with antibiotics discharge stopped after 4 to 18 days mean 120 days but 25 needed treatment for greater than 14 days Amoxicillin prophylaxis was administered to 27 56 of the patients after completion of therapy All patients were followed for 6 months Drainage recurred in 12 25 patients during the first 3 months after the study The recurrence rate was not affected by the antibiotic regimen the patients age the duration of drainage before initiation of antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis We conclude that intravenous widespectrum antibiotic therapy in conjunction with daily suction and debridement is efficacious for the treatment of chronic suppurative otitis media without cholesteatoma
R17	Oxidative phenotype and metabolic ratio MR of debrisoquine DBQ have been determined in 87 patients with Parkinsons disease and in 556 healthy control subjects Three patients 345 and 34 control subjects 612 having an MR greater than 126 were classified as poor metabolisers PM of DBQ ns The distribution of MR values in the 84 Parkinsonian patients classified as extensive metabolisers EM showed a less efficient oxidative rate when compared with controls of the same phenotype p less than 0001 This difference may be due to enzymatic inhibition caused by drug treatment in 40 of these patients As in patients not taking any drug known to inhibit the oxidation of DBQ distribution of MR values was not different from that in controls A negative correlation r  036 p less than 002 was found between MR of DBQ and age at onset of disease in patients free of drugs known to interact with DBQ metabolism A higher rate of DBQ oxidation could be a genetic factor that delays the clinical onset of Parkinsons disease in predisposed people
R18	Antibodies were raised against three fragments of the rat ANF molecule Cterminal atrial natriuretic factor ANF101126 Nterminal ANF1137 and the putative cleavage site of the ANF propeptide ANF94103 These antibodies were purified by affinity chromatography and revealed a major band 17K corresponding to the propeptide by Western blot analysis Antibodies against ANF94103 were used in a RIA All of the peptides that possess this region 9899 were able to displace iodinated proANF from the antibody However peptides that have only one part of the fragment such as ANF99126 or ANF198 failed to displace proANF human ANF7998 100 pmol demonstrated about 001 crossreactivity Immunohistochemical studies revealed that all atrial cardiocytes are reactive with the three antibodies Immunocryoultramicrotomy revealed that the propeptide travels uncleaved from the Golgi complex to immature granules and mature secretory granules These results indicate that cleavage of the ANF propeptide does not occur at these sites
R19	The effect of nasotracheal intubation on oxygen consumption VO2 carbon dioxide production VCO2 and resting energy expenditure REE was studied in 12 critically ill patients All patients were given midazolam 03 mgkg and etomidate 03 mgkg followed by 8 mg of vecuronium to facilitate intubation After nasotracheal intubation the patients were mechanically ventilated with an Erica Engstrom ventilator and connected to an Engstrom metabolic computer EMC Carbon dioxide production was measured using an infrared CO2 analyzer Resting energy expenditure was calculated by the EMC which incorporated an oxygen cell for VO2 measurement VO2 VCO2 and REE were recorded 5 10 15 20 25 and 30 minutes after intubation High values of the above parameters were observed 5 minutes after intubation values that gradually declined during the next 25 minutes At 25 and 30 minutes after intubation VO2 was 25 and 27 lower P  0054 than the VO2 at 5 minutes after intubation Carbon dioxide production and REE were also lower 10 15 20 25 and 30 minutes after intubation but were not significantly different from values obtained at 5 minutes The increase in VO2 associated with nasotracheal intubation may be detrimental for patients already suffering from hypoxia
R20	Studies in humans have shown that sensory stimuli presented in the context of certain tasks can elicit a late positive component LPC namely P300 in the scalprecorded evoked potential believed to reflect neural activity related to attentional processes A similar LPC has been reported in cats and monkeys In this study the LPC of the auditory evoked potential AEP in the cat was used to detect impairment in attention to a relevant stimulus after low levels of cerebral concussion produced by a fluid percussion device A hollow screw for fluid percussion and stainless steel screws for AEP recording were surgically placed in the skull After recovery from surgery animals were trained in the paradigm to obtain an LPC Pupillary dilation was conditioned to tones A random sequence of two discriminable tones was presented The lower tone had a probability of 01 and was followed by a tail shock toneshock After 400 to 1000 toneshock presentations animals attended to the lower tone stimulus as inferred by selective pupillary dilation In the AEP an early positive component at 50 to 120 msec related to an alerting response was enhanced and an LPC at 250 to 450 msec appeared in response to the paired toneshock Animals were then subjected to cerebral concussion Complete recovery of normal reflexes motor coordination and orienting response was seen within 2 hours after injury The LPC was suppressed for a period of at least 3 days suggesting that low magnitudes of brain injury can disrupt higherorder neural activities This disruption can persist despite recovery of other neurological functions
R21	Tenebrio molitor is an abundant storedgrain pest in the northern United States We evaluated an individual with workrelated symptoms of rhinoconjunctivitis on exposure to this insect Prick skin tests with extracts prepared from the larval pupal and adultlife stages were positive for the patient and for another individual with allergy to a closely related species of beetle Alphitobius diaperinus Specific IgE antibodies to the extracts were demonstrated by RAST RAST inhibition demonstrated immunologic crossreactivity between the life stages of T molitor and also between T molitor and A diaperinus as well as slight crossreactivity with blowfly The proteins in the extracts of each life stage were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis More than 15 protein bands were detected in each of the extracts although the patterns of separation were different for each life stage After immunoblotting and autoradiography six different IgEbinding proteins were identified in the larval extract five in the pupal extract and seven in the adult extract with similar IgEbinding patterns noted for the larval and adult extracts We conclude that this patient developed IgEmediated sensitivity to T molitor antigens as the result of occupational exposure This study confirms the fact that beetles of the Tenebrionid family are potentially significant allergens for workers exposed to grains or grain products
R22	This study is a followup of a patient DB who was reported Weiskrantz et al 1974 to be able to discriminate between simple visual forms within the scotoma caused by a lesion in calcarine cortex Among other capacities he was able to discriminate between lines of different orientation in the frontal plane Given the reported deficits for form discrimination but a high sensitivity for orientation discrimination in primates without striate cortex the question arises whether DBs apparent form discrimination arises from an ability to discriminate the orientations of components of the figures It is shown in the first experiment by using the optic disc as a control that his ability to detect stimuli in his scotoma cannot be due to stray light falling upon the intact field Next his ability to discriminate orientations is confirmed and an orientation threshold determined A range of form discriminations is presented varying in degree of orientation cues of their components It is confirmed that he can discriminate those forms originally studied in which such differences are large but not when orientation cues are small or minimal Finally his ability to compare two forms both projected within his scotoma is examined Even when the components of the two forms have large orientation differences and are highly discriminable when presented successfully DB appears to be unable to make a samedifferent comparison when both are presented simultaneously The evidence is interpreted against DBs having a residual capacity for form discrimination
R23	We examined the effect of low concentrations of gold compounds on the proliferation of human fibroblasts Gold sodium thiomalate GST inhibited both basal and interleukin1induced tritiated thymidine incorporation into fibroblasts in a dose and timedependent manner Significant inhibition was observed at the level of 5 microgramsml GST and greater than 50 inhibition was attained at 10 microgramsml These concentrations are attainable in the serum of treated patients Similar inhibition was observed when less than 1 microgramsml auranofin which is also within a serumattainable range was added Low concentrations of GST 010 microgramsml did not affect interleukin1 secretion from lipopolysaccharidestimulated human mononuclear phagocytes M phi when assessed by both human fibroblast and C3HHeJ mouse thymocyte proliferation assays When M phi precultured for 48 hours with GST 010 microgramsml were added to the fibroblast culture in the presence or absence of lipopolysaccharide there was no significant inhibition of M phiinduced DNA synthesis of fibroblasts In contrast when fibroblasts were precultured with GST 010 microgramsml for 48 hours and freshly separated M phi were added significant inhibition was observed in M phiinduced fibroblast proliferation at 5 microgramsml These results suggest that low concentrations of GST directly cause a reduction of fibroblast proliferation but do not affect the capability of M phi for induction of fibroblast proliferation Therefore gold compounds may play a role in the inhibition of the growth of rheumatoid pannus by direct inhibition of fibroblast proliferation
R24	The development of anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies has been studied in a group of 165 patients who underwent external radiotherapy for tumours of the pituitary or closely related anatomical sites and who have been observed for up to 10 years One hundred and forty had undergone pituitary surgery before radiotherapy All patients received external radiotherapy by a threefield technique giving 37504250 cGy in 15 or 16 fractions over 2022 days A combined test of anterior pituitary function using insulin hypoglycaemia or glucagon stimulation in conjunction with thyrotrophin and gonadotrophin releasing hormone tests and basal estimations of prolactin thyroid hormones and testosterone or oestradiol was performed before radiotherapy This was repeated six and 12 months later and subsequently annually Before radiotherapy 18 per cent of patients had normal growth hormone secretion 21 per cent had normal gonadotrophin secretion 57 per cent had normal corticotrophin reserve and 80 per cent had normal thyrotrophin secretion Life table analysis demonstrated increasing incidences of all anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies with time by five years all patients were growth hormone deficient 91 per cent were gonadotrophin deficient 77 per cent were corticotrophin deficient and 42 per cent were thyrotrophin deficient At eight years respective incidences of deficiencies were 100 96 84 and 49 per cent Radiationinduced hyperprolactinaemia was seen in 73 patients mean serum prolactin concentration rose from 227  11 mUl to a peak of 369  60 mUl at two years and subsequently declined towards the basal value The primary diagnosis patient age sex irradiated tissue volume and previous surgery were examined as variables that might influence the rate of development of anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies but none of these factors had a significant effect The radiation induced hyperprolactinaemia was however more marked in female patients Although anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies most commonly developed in the order growth hormone gonadotrophin corticotrophin thyrotrophin 61 per cent of patients other sequences were evident Most notably corticotrophin deficiency occurred before gonadotrophin deficiency There is a high incidence of anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies in patients treated surgically for pituitary tumours and the incidence increases after external radiotherapy Deficiencies may occur in an unpredictable sequence and endocrine testing is recommended on an annual basis
R25	Fifteen patients with hairy cell leukemia HCL were treated with deoxycoformycin pentostatin dCF 4 mgm2 intravenous IV every week x 3 and recombinant interferonalpha 2a rIFNalpha 2a 3 x 106 units subcutaneously SC daily x 4 weeks in alternating months for a total of 14 months Eleven patients had undergone splenectomy four had received prior systemic therapy with chlorambucil andor steroids All 15 are evaluable for toxicity and peripheral blood response while 14 are assessable for bone marrow response Toxicity was tolerable with grade 3 or 4 nausea and vomiting in three patients neutropenic fevers in five transient but significant depression in eight and localized cutaneous herpes zoster in four Circulating hairy cells were undetectable by the end of the first month in 10 of 13 patients and by the end of the second month in the other three Fourteen patients had bilateral bone marrow biopsies performed at baseline after 6 months of treatment at the end of treatment 14 months and at 6month intervals during followup Before treatment all patients had hypercellular marrows with hairy cels replacing normal marrow elements all showed at least a 95 clearing of their hairy cell infiltrate by 6 months of therapy However small collections of residual hairy cells could be detected intermittently on at least one side of bilateral samples in all patients All patients have completed treatment with a median duration of followup off therapy of 27 months range 15 to 31 months To date all peripheral counts and serum soluble interleukin2 receptor sIL2R levels remain stable and no patient has had progression of the hairy cell infiltrate in the bone marrow Although no patient achieved a pathologic complete response alternating monthly cycles of dCF and rIFNalpha 2a produced durable partial remissions PRs in all patients Continued followup is required to determine the length of such remissions
R26	The terminal drop hypothesis states that death is preceded by a decrease in cognitive functioning over an approximately fiveyear period prior to death Riegel  Riegel 1972 there is some disagreement as to whether this decrease is pervasive or restricted to specific abilities The present study assessed the relationship between distance from death and tests of vocabulary numerical facility and perceptual speed for 97 subjects who had died within seven years of testing Only vocabulary scores for those who died at age 70 or less and within two years of testing were affected by terminal drop An additional analysis comparing the performance of the deceased subjects with a stillliving sample matched for age gender and education produced nonsignificant results but a trend consistent with the initial analyses Thus the terminal drop phenomenon may be limited to abilities that typically are relatively unaffected by age such as vocabulary or other verbal abilities Furthermore the effects may be restricted to a time period much closer to death than had been originally proposed
R27	Patients with massive incarcerated hiatal hernia and no appreciable esophagitis present with a distinctly different clinical picture from those with hiatal hernia and reflux peptic esophagitis In a recent review 17 patients were encountered with this problem The patients were often elderly and presented with the following grave complications upper gastrointestinal obstruction upper gastrointestinal bleeding both acute and chronic from gastric ulcerations and perforated gastric ulcerations In these patients the surgical approach is better accomplished through the abdominal route These patients should be distinguished from those with a shortened esophagus resulting from chronic reflux peptic esophagitis who often require thoracotomy for surgical correction
R28	We have studied the pharmacokinetics of ketamine administered rectally in a dose of 10 mg kg1 to five children aged 69 yr and mean weight 2880 SD 655 kg An acceptable level of anaesthesia was not obtained in any patient Despite this the degree of analgesia obtained was good and no child required further administration of analgesics during the postoperative period Tolerance to the suppositories was excellent The absorption of ketamine was found to be relatively fast with a median peak concentration of 160 ng ml1 range 96250 ng ml1 at 075 h range 050100 h after administration The plasma concentrations of norketamine were greater than those of the parent drug with a maximum of 510 ng ml1 range 450810 ng ml1 at 081 h range 050100 h after administration The medians of the halflives of ketamine and norketamine were 315 h and 256 h respectively range 157495 h and 147530 h respectively
R29	This chapter provides a review of several major disorders affecting the pulmonary circulation These disorders may result in the development of significant symptoms particularly during exertion as well as substantial longterm morbidity and even mortality All of these conditions are complicated by difficulties in diagnosis and the lack of universally successful therapeutic options Although these conditions may be found in patients of all demographic characteristics this discussion has focused on those aspects that are of particular relevance to women It is hoped that with a heightened awareness of these conditions will come earlier diagnosis thereby allowing for the institution of therapies at a time when the prospect for successful intervention is greater
R30	Every so often we receive letters to the editor commenting on a previously published paper The following commentary is just such a letter Its content and review are so thorough we feel compelled to share the letter with our readers as it complements the original article on the history of glasses Spectacles Past Present and Future MarchApril 1986 Modesty keeps me from further elaboration on my original article Suffice it to say Dr Letochas letter elaborates upon the issues of the date and inventory of spectacles It stands solidly as an example of erudition in historical research
R31	Twentyfour patients 16 male and 8 female underwent a total of 35 operations for pulmonary aspergillosis Intrapulmonary aspergilloma was detected in 19 and Aspergillus empyema was present in 5 The major operative procedures performed were pneumonectomy in 2 patients lobectomy in 8 segmentectomy in 1 cavernostomy in 4 and openwindow thoracostomy in 5 The surgical results in 5 patients 70 years old or older were excellent Empyema developed postoperatively in 2 patients who had undergone wedge resection of the lung or segmentectomy Although resection involving the minimum extent possible is desirable in the treatment of intrapulmonary aspergilloma so as not to decrease lung function it is dangerous to perform a limited procedure in the case of aspergilloma with an invasive character In patients in poor general condition cavernostomy followed by muscle flap plombage is recommended For Aspergillus empyema the primary procedure was openwindow thoracostomy followed by plombage using chest wall muscle or omentum We consider omental flap plombage to be superior to thoracoplasty in some respects for mycotic empyema especially because it is a less extensive surgical procedure
R32	72 infants delivered normally were observed for 2 h after birth In the separation group n  34 the infant was placed on the mothers abdomen immediately after birth but removed after about 20 min for measuring and dressing In the contact group n  38 contact between mother and infant was uninterrupted for at least 1 h After about 20 min the infants began to make crawling movements towards the breast the rooting reflex soon came into play and at an average of 50 min after birth most of the infants were sucking at the breast More infants in the contact group than in the separation group showed the correct sucking technique 2438 vs 734 40 56 of the 72 mothers had received pethidine during labour the infants were also sedated and most of them 2540 did not suck at all It is suggested that contact between mother and infant should be uninterrupted during the first hour after birth or until the first breastfeed has been accomplished and that use of drugs such as pethidine should be restricted
R33	Mean red cell volume MCV was determined in 264 fetuses between 1541 weeks After exclusion of anemic hypoxic and chromosomally abnormal fetuses the MCV in 208 umbilical venous samples was shown to decrease with gestation r  064 P less than 001 and a normal range was constructed by linear regression analysis An elevated MCV was found in both fetuses with triploidy in four of five with monosomy X and in four of ten with trisomies 18 or 21 The MCV was similarly raised in four of five fetuses with gross anomalies in whom cytogenetic cultures had failed Significant correlations were found in chromosomally abnormal fetuses between the elevation in MCV and both the nucleated red cell r  069 P less than 01 and reticulocyte counts r  057 P less than 05 There was a similar correlation with nucleated red cells in 16 severely anemic fetuses with Rh disease 12 of whom had a raised MCV Elevation in MCV was unrelated to hypoxia Macrocytosis had a sensitivity of 71 and a specificity of 95 in the second trimester for predicting an abnormal karyotype in nonanemic fetuses kappa index 060 Fetal MCV may provide clinically useful information while one awaits culture results We suggest that karyotyping be considered in fetuses undergoing blood sampling for other indications in whom the MCV is raised
R34	Trichloroacetic acid chemexfoliation is an effective versatile and safe therapeutic option for patients with extensive actinic keratoses of the face and scalp With an experienced and skilled operator the associated complications are rare and tend to be mild Cosmetically the patient not only benefits from removal of the erythematous scaly actinic keratoses but also obtains cosmetically pleasing rejuvenation of facial skin and diminution of fine facial wrinkles Two representative cases are presented In comparison with other available treatment modalities trichloroacetic acid chemexfoliation involves a shorter treatment period and wound healing time and is not dependent on patient compliance
R35	Five young women all of whom had anaphylactic responses in operating units are described Three of them worked in a hospital three showed immediate hypersensitivity to fruit and all had known urticaria to latex Anaphylaxis appeared progressively 15 to 30 minutes after injection of anaesthetic drugs Skin tests with these drugs were negative Skin prick tests through gloves and with four different allergen preparations saline which had been incubated with gloves and three kinds of latex were positive Human basophil degranulation tests with all four allergens were positive and radio allergo sorbent tests to latex were also positive IgEdependent allergy to latex may be investigated by questionnaire and if necessary by prick tests before each operation to prevent anaphylaxis due to surgical gloves
R36	Pacemaker twiddlers syndrome is the phenomenon whereby a pacemaker patient may actively dislodge a pacing electrode by manipulating often unconsciously the permanent implanted pacemaker This unusual case is remarkable in several respects surgical precautions originally taken to secure the pulse generator against migration proved ineffective the displaced lead featured an active fixation screwin electrode and the reported dislodgement occurred not in the early postimplant stage but fully three months later It can be concluded that even with advanced lead technology and operative precaution electrode dislodgement cannot be absolutely prevented Awareness of this phenomenon especially by pacemaker followup care personnel could lessen its occurrence
R37	Activity of nucleoside polyphosphatases including adenosine diphosphatase ADPase in the glomerular basement membrane GBM of the rat kidney can be demonstrated in situ by using cytochemical methods at the ultrastructural level To study the possible influence of glomerular ADPase activity on experimentally induced intraglomerular platelet aggregation we carried out alternate perfusion experiments with human platelets and adenosine diphosphate ADP solution in rat kidneys ex vivo This was done in rats with reduced glomerular phosphatase activity induced by either an intravenous injection of doxorubicin 85 mgkg body weight or local xirradiation 2000 rads as well as in rats with normal glomerular enzyme activity that is untreated rats or rats injected intravenously with aminonucleoside of puromycin PAN 15 mgkg body weight It is shown that in kidneys of both doxorubicintreated and xirradiated rats intraglomerular platelet aggregation occurs in approximately 50 of the glomeruli whereas in PANtreated or control rats no platelet aggregation could be detected by light microscopy Activated platelets by electron microscopy and betathromboglobulin or platelet factor 4 immunofluorescence microscopy could be detected with appropriate fluorescinated antibodies along the GBM exclusively in kidneys with reduced ADPase activity caused by doxorubicin or xirradiation treatment Because glomerular ADPase activity in contrast to other putative antithrombotic molecules in the GBM that is heparan sulfate proteoglycans is clearly affected by doxorubicin or xirradiation treatment it is suggested that the activity of glomerular ADPase may reflect an important antithrombotic principle in the GBM of the rat kidney
R38	Our knowledge of the spectrum of renal abscesses has increased as a result of more sensitive radiologic techniques The classification of intrarenal abscess now includes acute focal bacterial nephritis and acute multifocal bacterial nephritis as well as the previously recognized renal cortical abscess renal corticomedullary abscess and xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis In general the clinical presentation of these entities does not differentiate them various radiographic studies can distinguish them however The intrarenal abscess is usually treated successfully with antibiotic therapy alone Antistaphylococcal therapy is indicated for the renal cortical abscess whereas therapy directed against the common gramnegative uropathogens is indicated for most of the other entities The perinephric abscess is often an elusive diagnosis has a more serious prognosis and is more difficult to treat Drainage of the abscess and sometimes partial or complete nephrectomy are required for resolution
R39	This study was performed in an attempt to determine if there was any clinical or cost benefit of microdiscectomy over surgical discectomy Each patient was asked to rate his pain or neurologic deficit on a scale from 1 to 10 1  no pain or deficit and 10  the most severe pain or deficit Thirty patients underwent microdiscectomy Average preoperative back pain was rated 803 and leg pain 853 Preoperative numbness was rated 529 and weakness 538 The median time off work preoperatively was 4 weeks The mean hospitalization was 2 days and a postoperative median of 8 weeks for returning to work Average followup was 174 months Mean back pain was 18 with 57 having no back pain at followup Mean leg pain at followup was 13 with 67 having no leg pain Numbness was rated 097 with 85 having none at followup Weakness was rated 14 with 76 having none at followup Thirtyfour patients underwent surgical discectomy Average preoperative back pain was rated 756 and leg pain 932 Preoperative numbness was rated 694 and weakness 588 The median time off work preoperatively was 6 weeks The mean hospitalization was 7 days and a median of 7 weeks postoperative before returning to work Average followup was 185 months The mean pain rating for back pain was 109 with 74 having no back pain at followup The average leg pain was 109 with 74 having no leg pain at followupABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R40	As part of a program to determine the feasibility of a CNS auditory prosthesis the tissue reaction to electrodes chronically implanted in the cochlear nucleus CN of the guinea pig was examined Varied open operative approaches and microelectrode designs were utilized Silicon substrate thin film and platinumiridium wire electrodes tethered and untethered were placed successfully in different divisions of the CN Implantation through a posterior suboccipital approach was most successful Histologic examinations demonstrated a glial cell proliferation confined to the area of the electrode track that never exceeded 15 microns in width No neuronal loss or significant effect on cell morphology was seen and reactive cells were absent Electrode migration was apparent in a minority of animal preparations Although potential problems were identified our findings lend support to the feasibility of implanting a neuroprosthesis in the CN and have helped to establish methods for future studies of chronic intranuclear stimulation
R41	A technically successful biopsy or drainage procedure performed with computed tomographic CT guidance depends on two essential elements determination of the correct entry point on the patient and placement of the biopsy needle or trocar drainage catheter along a predetermined track A handheld guidance device was used in conjunction with the lighting system on the CT scanner and measurements obtained from CT images to achieve this goal in 40 patients The approach minimized trauma to the patient and decreased the time required for CT
R42	The intake of cola beverages from two national surveys NFCS 197778 and NHANES II was used to examine certain assumptions important to a mathematical model employed to estimate dietary exposure to substances in food The assumptions center on the relationship between frequency of consumption and serving size and on the constancy of serving size within age groups Results showed the frequency of cola consumption was associated with 55 to 83 of the variability in cola intake and that mean cola serving size was not linearly related to frequency of consumption However while upperlevel 90th  percentile cola consumers consumed more frequently they also had larger than average serving sizes Therefore because the model incorporates a standard serving size it significantly underestimated p less than 01 intake for the two groups of upperlevel consumers examined Furthermore comparisons for cola serving sizes reported in the surveys showed differences by sex as well as systematic differences between the surveys in that the average difference between age and sex groups within each survey was similar but NFCS 197778 had a larger average size for each group than did NHANES II Attention should be given to the nature of the food consumption databases used for estimating dietary exposure because systematic bias may cause considerable differences in estimation
R43	Isolated metastatic malignant melanoma to the facial nerve has never been reported This presentation illustrates a primary melanoma of the helix of the ear that was treated by excisional biopsy and then wedge resection in 1983 The primary melanoma was Clarks level IV and 13 mm in thickness In 1985 a facial paresis slowly developed There was no gross evidence of recurrent melanoma in the ear or neck but CT scan showed a mass in the region of the stylo mastoid foramen A reoperation of the primary site revealed metastatic melanoma in the facial nerve expanding it to approximately 10 times its normal size A composite resection was done for the melanoma and the paralyzed face was immediately rehabilitated by a masseter muscle transfer The patient received 6000 rads to this area postoperatively and has remained free of disease to date having returned to his profession as a dentist A detailed study of all the specimens indicated that this represented a primary metastasis to the facial nerve
R44	Previous expert working groups have concluded that common descriptors and measurements are needed for all types of population groups to provide improved and expanded coverage and comparable and compatible data among surveys monitoring the nutritional and dietary status of the US population This report summarizes the discussions of an ad hoc Expert Panel charged with identifying core indicators to assess the nutritional status of difficulttosample populations Members of the Expert Panel had wide research experience including survey design food security food consumption nutritional status healthrelated conditions associated with nutritional status and nutrition and public policy The varied backgrounds of the Panel members led to consideration of the concept of core indicators of nutritional status from a broad perspective Early in their discussions the Expert Panel recognized that public health officials and policymakers use information on nutritional status for the purposes of problem identification program planning and resource direction and program and policy evaluation This recognition raised several issues which formed the conceptual framework for subsequent discussions study conclusions and research recommendations These issues centered on the following concepts the purpose for which data are used determines the suitability of indicators the scope of information required varies for the purposes identified above a broad range of indicators is needed to supply information useful for public policy decisions on nutrition that is assessment of the nutritional status of populations by measurement of dietary intakes of nutrients and anthropometric biochemical and clinical indices can provide only a portion of the information needed for these purposes in the United States nutritional problems in the US general population may signal some but not all anticipated nutritional concerns for difficulttosample populations and adequate coverage and suitable sampling methods are overriding concerns for obtaining interpretable data and appear to be a larger issue than suitable measures for nutritional assessment in the case of difficulttosample populations Guided by consideration of these issues the Expert Panel recognized that they could not provide a comprehensive design for the evaluation of nutritional status for all difficulttosample populations that would be appropriate for all public health and policy purposes Therefore the Expert Panel concentrated their discussions on enumeration of the various issues that must be considered in planning any effort to evaluate the nutritional concerns for such populationsABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS
R45	Direct visualization of the coronary arteries was performed by using a new ultrathin angioscopic catheter system in experimental animals and 4 patients with coronary artery disease during percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty PTCA In this catheter system inspection of the coronary arteries was achieved during washout of blood by bolus infusion of 810 ml of saline into the coronary artery through the guide catheter In the preliminary experience with this coronary angioscopic system there were some limitations In 2 patients removal of coronary blood by manual injection of saline was not adequate and diagnostic TV images could not be obtained In 2 patients with tortuous coronary arteries the catheter could not pass to the atheromatous plaques owing to lack of flexibility of the fiberoptic catheter Furthermore angina pectoris occurred in 2 patients during angioscopy owing probably to interference with coronary blood flow by the guide catheter andor fiberoptic catheter itself For future clinical application of coronary angioscopy further improvements in the instrument are necessary
R46	A total of 111 adults underwent repair of congenital ureteropelvic junction obstruction during a 15year period A majority of the patients 77 per cent presented with flank pain In all patients established 89 per cent or intermittent 11 per cent hydronephrosis was demonstrated In contrast with our former practice a majority of the patients 86 per cent underwent dismembered pyeloplasty with intubation Of the 10 hypertensive patients 8 remained hypertensive postoperatively but only 3 of 22 patients with stones had recurrent calculi The success rate was 95 per cent with 1 operation Three patients required a second repair and 1 underwent nephrectomy Therefore the eventual success rate was 99 per cent
R47	Cysts of the prostate and seminal vesicles are confusing abnormalities because they are uncommon and their origin is uncertain Several approaches to diagnosis have been used most recently CT and transrectal sonography In this study we investigated the value of MR imaging in the diagnosis of six cases of prostatic cyst and five cases of cysts of the seminal vesicles All patients were symptomatic T1 and T2weighted spinecho images were obtained in all cases pathologic confirmation was available in four patients MR images were analyzed prospectively without knowledge of clinical data or the results of other imaging procedures In all cases low and highsignal masses were observed on T1 and T2weighted images respectively The cysts were unilocular with a sharply defined margin ranging from 05 to 30 cm in diameter The thin wall was of low signal intensity on T2weighted images Our experience suggests that MR imaging is useful in demonstrating the liquid content of prostatic and seminalvesicle cysts and in establishing their size and location
R48	Based on its activity in a variety of tests in vivo and in vitro McN5707 trans62chlorophenyl1235610bhexahydropyrrolo 21aisoquinoline is a novel potential antidepressant McN5707 blocked tetrabenazineinduced sedation and ptosis in mice and rats and potently inhibited the uptake of norepinephrine by synaptosomes from rat hypothalamus Ki approximately 2 nM and the uptake of serotonin by synaptosomes from rat cerebral cortex Ki approximately 10 nM McN5707 also inhibited the uptake of dopamine by synaptosomes from rat striatum Ki approximately 40 nM however the stereotypic behavior often caused by dopamine uptake inhibitors was not evident in rats at doses of 300 mgkg po or less In receptor binding assays McN5707 potently inhibited ketanserin binding to serotonin 5HT2 receptors in synaptic membranes from rat cerebral cortex apparent Ki approximately 8 nM In mice McN5707 antagonized 5hydroxytryptophaninduced head twitches Spiperone binding to dopamine D2 receptors in synaptic membranes from rat striatum was weakly inhibited by McN5707 apparent Ki approximately 400 nM as was the binding of WB4101 to alpha1 adrenergic receptors apparent Ki approximately 150 nM McN5707 was essentially inactive as an inhibitor of 3Hclonidine binding to alpha2 adrenergic receptors and of 3Hquinuclidinyl benzilate binding to muscarinic receptors In experiments with guinea pig ileum McN5707 weakly antagonized histamineinduced contractions and exhibited virtually no cholinergic or anticholinergic activity Our observations indicate McN5707 possesses attributes of both tricyclic and newer atypical antidepressants because it inhibits the uptake of both norepinephrine and serotonin and blocks 5HT2 receptors but lacks some of the anticholinergic and behavioral properties often associated with them
R49	Slow nerve conduction velocities temporal dispersion of action potentials and conduction block occur in polyneuropathies with segmental demyelination Conduction block has been reported in focal compressive neuropathies and in acute and chronic autoimmune polyneuropathy but not in hereditary motor and sensory demyelinating neuropathy We report conduction block in five nerves of four patients from two families with a hereditary neuropathy with susceptibility to pressure palsies and pathologic changes of segmental demyelination and tomaculous swellings Conduction block that may be long lasting is a feature of this type of hereditary neuropathy which should be considered in the differential diagnosis of this electrophysiologic finding
R50	Although the most direct way to interfere with the reninangiotensin system RAS is at the level of the angiotensin II AII receptor the currently available AII receptor antagonists are peptides still retaining significant agonistic properties with the obvious drawbacks of limited stability and lack of oral activity We have characterized simple Nbenzylimidazoles as weak but selective AII receptor antagonists with a competitive mode of action Chemical modification of these early leads led to EXP6155 and EXP6803 which show approximately 10 and 100fold higher affinity Oral activity was obtained for EXP7711 and in particular for EXP9654 This class of compounds displaces 3HAII from its specific binding sites in various tissues They competitively antagonize AIIinduced responses in various in vitro and in vivo preparations but do not influence AIIinduced responses to KCl norepinephrine and vasopressin nor do they affect converting enzyme or renin In high renin models of elevated blood pressure such as the renal hypertensive rat and sodiumdepleted dog these substances produce a sustained decrease in arterial pressure without changing heart rate after intravenous and oral EXP7711 and EXP9654 administration None of these compounds showed agonistic activity in any of the above test systems In conclusion the nonpeptide structures described herein are selective and competitive AII receptor antagonists and add another dimension to the arsenal of drugs manipulating the RAS
R51	Ten cases in which leukemic cells contained numerous cytoplasmic granules were examined by using a panel of cytochemical reactions The diagnoses in the 10 cases were mast cell leukemia chronic basophilic leukemia and acute myeloid leukemia with basophilic differentiation in one case each acute promyelocytic leukemia in two cases acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in two cases and blastic hairy cell leukemia in three cases The cytochemical panel consisted of peroxidase toluidine blue chloroacetate esterase aminocaproate esterase tartrateresistant acid phosphatase and immunoalkaline phosphatase for plateletmegakaryocytespecific antigen The unusual cytologic features of leukemic cells in cases similar to our 10 cases have caused considerable diagnostic difficulties In our 10 cases however the effective use of cytochemical studies helped to achieve accurate identification of the various types of leukemic cells We conclude that the intelligent application of cytochemical techniques continues to be useful for the accurate cytodiagnosis of hematopoietic neoplasms
R52	Tumorinfiltrating lymphocytes TIL were obtained from human ovarian tumors expanded in the presence of IL2 in culture and studied for cytotoxicity against fresh autologous and allogeneic ovarian carcinoma CA targets TIL from ovarian tumors grew well in long term cultures achieving from 8 to 682fold expansion TIL cultured with IL2 were cytotoxic against both autologous and allogeneic fresh ovarian CA targets and no specificity for autologous tumor could be demonstrated in any of the cultures In all fresh TIL preparations CD3 lymphocytes were the major cell type and contained a high proportion up to 51 of activated IL2R cells as determined by twocolor flow cytometry Sorting of bulk TIL cultures followed by cytotoxicity assays identified the Leu19 cells both CD3 and CD3 as effectors of cytotoxicity against autologous and allogeneic tumor cell targets Cold target inhibition assays showed that allogeneic targets both ovarian CA and a sarcoma competed effectively with autologous ovarian CA targets for Leu19 effectors in TIL cultures mAb to Leu19 or Leu2a did not block lysis of autologous targets by sorted effectors OKT3 antibody augmented lysis of autologous targets by CD3Leu19 effectors only These results show that nonMHCrestricted Leu19 effectors in cultures of TIL with 1000 Uml of rIL2 mediate lysis of autologous and allogeneic tumor cells The CD3Leu19 cells the main population in these cultures do not mediate tumor lysis To determine the phenotype of antitumor effectors in IL2 cultures of TIL cell sorting followed by functional assays are necessary
R53	To evaluate the thrombolytic effects of the native tissuetype plasminogen activator tPA the authors used a thrombus model simulating clinical situations The native tPA AK124 was obtained from humanderived normal cells Experimental canine coronary thrombosis was produced by partial constriction and endothelial denudation of the vessel In 19 dogs coronary occlusive thrombus was produced Three hours after total occlusion of the coronary artery with thrombus the authors attempted the thrombolytic therapy in 16 dogs Histologically threehour thrombus was composed of a mixture of platelet aggregates fibrin and blood cells They infused 0375 mgkg tPA intravenously in 7 dogs and 20000 IUkg urokinase UK in 9 Coronary recanalization was achieved in 5 71 with tPA infusion and 6 67 with UK infusion Plasma fibrinogen levels decreased to 76 of preinfusion value in the dogs with tPA infusion and to 34 in those with UK infusion Coronary reocclusion occurred in 2 dogs with tPA and 3 with UK Thus the native tPA AK124 can provide coronary thrombolysis without severe depletion of plasma fibrinogen levels
R54	Ig kappachain gene rearrangement results in the displacement or loss of the DNA immediately 5 of Jk This retained DNA is found on a different size fragment than in the germline a reciprocal fragment and contains the reciprocal joint of rearranged Vk and Jk genes the backtoback fusion of the heptamernonamer recombination signals B cells of independent origin rarely have reciprocal fragments of the same size However we report that 9 of 15 B cell hybridomas of independent origin have reciprocal fragments of the same size 8kb BamHI fragments unrelated to their productive rearrangements An 8kb reciprocal fragment has also occurred on about 25 of the kappa alleles of normal splenic B cells We find that the reciprocal fragments in two of these hybridomas contain the reciprocal joints of Jk1 genes and different Vk8 genes In addition we find that at least 8 of the 12 Jk4 or Jk5 expressing hybridomas have undergone double recombinations on their productive kappa alleles The implications of these findings on the high frequency of 8kb reciprocal rearrangements and on Vk rearrangement are discussed
R55	To assess whether the manifestations of acute ischemic heart disease in the elderly are less typical than in younger patients the presenting clinical features and their associated relative risks for acute myocardial infarction AMI were compared in 2625 patients greater than or equal to 65 years of age and 5109 patients less than 65 years of age These patients were evaluated for acute chest pain in the emergency departments of 7 hospitals The same features were associated with increased relative risks for AMI in younger and elderly patients The relative risks among older patients however were consistently closer to 10 for classic features including male gender pressurelike quality of pain substernal location typical pattern of pain radiation and electrocardiographic evidence of ischemia or AMI Analyses for the endpoint acute ischemic heart disease ie AMI or unstable angina yielded similar findings Elderly patients were more likely to be admitted to the hospital 56 vs 35 p less than 00001 and to the coronary care unit 37 vs 23 p less than 00001 in the absence of either AMI or unstable angina These data support the hypothesis that diagnosis of acute chest pain is especially difficult in elderly patients
R56	Adrenal steroidogenesis is dependent upon cholesterol derived from both de novo biosynthesis and uptake of plasma lipoproteins through the low density lipoprotein LDL receptor pathway Recent studies have demonstrated that patients homozygous for familial hypercholesterolemia have a mild impairment in cortisol secretion during maximal ACTH stimulation Mevinolin a competitive inhibitor of 3hydroxy3methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase has been used clinically to inhibit de novo cholesterol synthesis in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia In this study we examined hypothalamicpituitaryadrenal function in seven patients with defects in the LDL receptor pathway both before and during treatment with oral mevinolin 20 mg twice a day to assess whether inhibition of cholesterol synthesis influences steroidogenesis under basal conditions and in response to ovine CRH and exogenous ACTH Two months after initiation of therapy high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels were significantly elevated and LDL cholesterol levels were reduced although not normalized Basal and ovine CRHstimulated adrenocortical function were normal in all patients both before and during therapy Plateau plasma cortisol concentrations achieved during maximal ACTH stimulation were lower than those in control subjects in all patients both before and during therapy All patients however had an approximately 3fold increase over basal values These results suggest that treatment of patients with defects in the LDL receptor pathway with mevinolin improves the plasma lipid profile and does not result in adrenal dysfunction or further exacerbation of the mild impairment of adrenal function during maximal ACTH stimulation
R57	This paper describes the technique of sequential endoscopy and biopsy of the intact rat stomach It is recommended that this procedure be performed on fasted animals with access to water only when a mortality of only 4 can be achieved
R58	The mediastinal dissection was introduced in 1962 to manage an otherwise uniformly fatal problem in head and neck oncology stomal recurrence of laryngeal squamous cell cancer The morbidity and mortality rates continued to be high and the survival rates low but they were an improvement over those of other treatment plans Since then refinements of the ablative techniques and major advances in the reconstructive techniques have significantly decreased morbidity and mortality rates The most recent data indicate a 45 survival rate at 42 months It is evident that early diagnosis and staging of stomal recurrences will yield successful results Because the mediastinal dissection operation is now safe it should be applied more liberally in head and neck oncology situations such as subglottic extension of laryngeal cancer advanced thyroid cancers cervical esophageal and tracheal cancers and all head and neck tumors with lownodal disease
R59	Standardized terminology does not exist to differentiate the conditions that constitute response diagnosis and disease diagnosis described in this review Therefore appropriate descriptive terminology is proposed for these two periodontic diagnoses Diagnostic terms are needed to discern stages of disease Periodontitis is a chronic disease prone to episodic recurrence that needs a dynamic diagnosis that can change with each reevaluation In addition the legal ramifications of failing to recognize or adequately described disease recurrence are discussed
R60	This report describes two women who presented with severe respiratory failure and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates in the fall of 1989 Both required prolonged assisted ventilation because of severe shunt physiology Open lung biopsies on admission revealed a small vessel vasculitis as the sole morphologic abnormality in both patients Both responded to high dose corticosteroids Neither patient exhibited evidence of systemic vasculitis and neither had serologic evidence of an immune disorder Common to both patients was ingestion of Ltryptophan One patient exhibited several features of the eosinophiliamyalgia syndrome The other patient did not appear to have the syndrome but the temporal relationship between the onset of symptoms and initiation of Ltryptophan treatment was striking The presentation of these patients alters our notions concerning the spectrum of clinical manifestations caused by this agent and the response to methylprednisolone supports its efficacy in the treatment of this disorder
R61	Digital subtraction angiography DSA provides additional information regarding patency or occlusion of vessels that is not always detected by conventional angiography Patency of distal vessels is a positive prognostic factor in predicting salvage of the foot in patients having various treatment procedures for occlusive atherosclerotic disease I evaluated the ability of intraarterial DSA to add important diagnostic and prognostic information concerning the vascular anatomy of the ankle and foot in 42 patients whose initial conventional diagnostic arteriogram was inadequate Patency of foot vessels indicates a high likelihood of success in patients having revascularization and absence of flow to the foot indicates that amputation is likely to be required
R62	Voltagegated sodium channels are largely localized to the nodes of Ranvier in myelinated axons providing a physiological basis for saltatory conduction What happens to these channels in demyelinated axons is not known with certainty Experimentally demyelinated axons were examined by using a wellcharacterized polyclonal antibody directed against sodium channels Immunocytochemical and radioimmunoassay data were consistent with the distribution of an increased number of sodium channels along segments of previously internodal axon These findings affirm the plasticity of sodium channels in demyelinated axolemma and may be relevant to understanding how axons recover conduction after demyelination
R63	Foreign objects in gunshot wound tracts are common when the bullets have struck intermediate targets This report describes a coin struck by a 045 caliber bullet and propelled into the body of a homicide victim The report also describes the condition of the victim found with lime covering her body
R64	Because there is controversy regarding whether subsets of peripheral blood lymphocytes PBLs are part of the malignant clone in patients with multiple myeloma we studied this question by immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene analysis Southern blot analysis with antibody probes demonstrated clonal immunoglobulin gene rearrangements in PBLs of seven of nine patients that were identical to those seen in their marrow plasma cells Circulating plasma cells were not detected in any of these patients In contrast no patient demonstrated clonally rearranged T cell receptor genes In one sequentially studied patient PBLs obtained at diagnosis when he had stage I DurieSalmon contained only germline DNA while analysis of PBLs at relapse stage III revealed a clonally rearranged band These data confirm the notion that circulating lymphocytes in patients with myeloma are part of the malignant clone and furthermore these malignant cells are of B cell rather than T cell lineage
R65	Pancreatic enzyme products are formulated manufactured and sold without submitting efficacy or bioavailability data to the Food and Drug Administration because of a quirk in the law We documented therapeutic failures in three patients with cystic fibrosis after pharmacists substituted generic pancrelipase capsules for the Pancrease brand Gastrointestinal symptoms and fat malabsorption rapidly resolved after therapy was reinstituted with brand name products In vitro analysis indicated that after 1 hour of exposure to simulated gastric fluid lipase activity was less than 200 U per capsule from all three generic capsules dispensed to the patients compared with 6820 U per capsule from Pancrease These data indicate that the enteric coating of the generic product was defective and that the substituted product was not bioequivalent to the prescribed brand We conclude that the Food and Drug Administration should institute regulations over this group of products
R66	Intraoperative radiation therapy IORT is a relatively new mode of cancer treatment which is being used with increasing frequency IORT presents several challenges to the anesthesiologist including patients who are debilitated from their disease or chemotherapy operations involving major tumor resections intraoperative interdepartmental transport of patients and remote monitoring of patients during electron beam therapy This report discusses the anesthetic management of ten children undergoing IORT With adequate preparation and interdepartmental communication complications can be avoided during these challenging cases
R67	The aim of the present study was the classification of the receptors that mediate 5hydroxytryptamine 5HTinduced responses in dog basilar artery Isolated preparations from basilar artery of mongrel dogs denuded of endothelium were contracted by 5HT in the presence of 6 microM cocaine In the presence of either ketanserin or spiperone concentrationeffect curves for 55HT became biphasic The responses to low concentrations of 55HT were resistant to blockade by either antagonist The responses to high concentrations of 5HT were antagonized by ketanserin and spiperone in a concentrationdependent and partially surmountable manner The lack of complete surmountability was at least partially due to fade during the determination of the cumulative concentrationeffect curves The pKB values for the component of the 5HTinduced contractions that was antagonized by ketanserin and spiperone were 94 and 102 log M respectively The findings are consistent with the assumption of an interaction of ketanserin and spiperone with 5HT at 5HT2 receptors On the other hand the response to low concentrations of 5HT is not mediated through 5HT2 receptors This response is antagonized by phentolamine with an affinity approximately 10 times lower than its affinity to 5HT2 receptors but not by prazosin or benextramine It is conceivable that the receptor that mediates the response to low concentrations of 5HT belongs to the 5HT1Asubpopulation as suggested recently
R68	OBJECTIVETo investigate the current problems and needs of terminally ill cancer patients and their family members and to discover their views of hospital community and support team services DESIGNProspective study of patients and families by questionnaire interviews in the patients homes SETTINGInner London and north Kent London suburbs SUBJECTS65 Patients each with a member of their family or a career MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESRatings of eight current problems and ratings and comments on three serviceshospital doctors and nurses general practitioners and district nurses and the support team staffobtained after a minimum of two weeks care from palliative care support teams RESULTSEffect of anxiety on the patients nearest career and symptom control were rated as the most severe current problems by both patients and families a few patients and families identified other severe problems Families ratings of pain control symptom control and effect of anxiety on the patient were significantly worse than the patients ratings p less than 005 Support teams received the most praise being rated by 58 89 patients and 59 91 of family members as good as excellent General practitioners and district nurses were rated good or excellent by 46 71 patients and 46 71 family members but six 9 in each group rated the service as poor or very bad and ratings in the inner London district were significantly worse than those in the outer London district Hospital doctors and nurses were rated good or excellent by 22 34 patients and 35 54 of family members and 14 22 patients and 15 23 family members rated this service as poor or very bad Negative comments referred to communication especially at diagnosis coordination of services the attitude of the doctor delays in diagnosis and difficulties in getting doctors to visit at home Family members were more satisfied with the services than were patients CONCLUSIONSPalliative care needs to include both the patient and family because the needs of the family may exceed those of the patient Support teams and some hospital and community doctors and nurses met the perceived needs of dying patients and families but better education and organisation of services are needed
R69	Autologous fibrin glue was prepared from individual patients and used as a surgical adhesive Sixteen patients undergoing elective eyelid operations were studied The fibrinogen was prepared from autologous blood by a cryoprecipitate technique When mixed with commercially available thrombin a fibrin clot develops with sufficient adhesive strength that the need for extensive suturing is obviated Complications were few and due to technical factors in the initial cases all patients were followed up for at least 1 year Problems associated with suture closure of wounds eg cysts granulomas milia were not seen The fibrin glue not only sealed the wound but also acted as a hemostatic agent The autologous preparation is superior to commercial products since it avoids the problem of transfusiontransmitted disease The fibrin glue and minimal suture technique is an alternative to eyelid incision closure and may be useful in many other types of operative procedures
R70	A 31yearold man was thrown from his motorcycle sustaining a thoracolumbar fracture and cervical spine fracture with no evidence of neurologic function below L1 At the time of spinal fusion there was diffuse bleeding from the soft tissues Visualization of the thoracolumbar fraction revealed separation of the laminae with a dural tear and extruding spinal cord tissue Laboratory evaluation identified abnormal clotting studies intraoperatively and postoperatively We postulate that release of potent spinal cord thromboplastins into the systemic circulation may elicit a coagulopathy as has been recognized following craniocerebral trauma
R71	Insulinlike growth factor IGFI stimulates the growth of many tissues including growth plate cartilage However the role of IGFbinding proteins in the growth process is controversial We purified a 25kDa IGFbinding protein BP25 from amniotic fluid We tested the effect of this BP25 preparation on both basal and IGFIstimulated growth of chick embryo pelvic cartilages maintained in serumfree organ culture Cartilage wet weight was 41  03 mgcartilage initially after 3 days BP25 inhibited both basal and IGFIstimulated growth Control cartilages weighed 74  07 mgcartilage while those incubated with 100 nM BP25 weighed 58  05 mgcartilage P less than 0001 vs control BP25 concentrations as low as 02 nM significantly inhibited basal cartilage growth Cartilages incubated with 125 nM IGFI weighed 104  08 mgcartilage P less than 0001 vs control while those incubated with both 100 nM BP25 and 125 nM IGFI weighed 81  05 mgcartilage P less than 0001 vs cartilage incubated with IGFI alone BP25 concentrations as low as 04 nM significantly inhibited IGFIstimulated cartilage growth BP25 also inhibited basal and IGFIstimulated increases in cartilage dry weight 3Hthymidine incorporation into DNA and 35SO4 incorporation into proteoglycan A second BP25 preparation which in the presence of 1 plateletpoor plasma acts synergistically with IGFI to stimulate DNA synthesis and cell replication of fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in tissue culture inhibited IGFIstimulated cartilage growth to the same degree as did our BP25 preparation In separate experiments proteins present in serumfree medium conditioned for 3 days by chick cartilages were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis transferred to nitrocellulose and incubated with 125IIGFI This medium was found to contain two IGFbinding proteins one appeared to be the chick equivalent of BP25 while the other had a molecular mass similar to that of a poorly characterized human 34kDa IGFbinding protein We conclude that purified BP25 inhibits the growth of chick embryo pelvic cartilage in our serumfree organ culture system Since conditioned medium from these cartilages contains both IGFIlike peptides and IGFbinding proteins such as BP25 we suggest that the IGFbinding proteins present may act to downregulate the growthpromoting effects of the local IGF peptides
R72	The influence of endothelial cells ECs on polymorphonuclear leukocyte PMN motility was examined using in vitro assays of PMN diapedesis and chemotaxis ECs are seen to release arachidonic acid 204 metabolites that directly increase or decrease PMN movement with their general effect being enhanced motility This effect can be increased or decreased by treating ECs with stimulators or inhibitors of 204 metabolism respectively The metabolites include thromboxane B2 which increases PMN random motility chemotaxis and diapedesis in a doseresponsive manner and which acts as a chemoattractant 6ketoPGF1 alpha which increases chemotaxis and diapedesis at high doses but decreases these responses at low doses and a lipoxygenasederived metabolite suggested to be 5hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid which increases chemotaxis and diapedesis Thromboxane A2 and prostacyclin mimetics also affect chemotaxis in qualitatively similar manners as TxB2 and 6ketoPGF1 alpha respectively but display greater potency EC release of these metabolites is also seen to be substratum modulated with an increased production by cells cultured on extracellular matrices These results suggest that ECs are capable of modulating PMN motility and suggest a role for ECs in the control of PMN diapedesis
R73	Carcinoid tumors arising in the thymus are rare Since Rosai and Higa in 1972 distinguished these neoplasms from thymomas fewer than 100 cases have been reported in the world literature In a 38year review 1950 to 1988 of surgically treated thymic tumors at Henry Ford Hospital only 7 cases of thymic carcinoids were identified These 6 men and 1 woman ranged in age from 27 to 70 years mean 48 years at diagnosis Followup was available in all patients with the longest survival being 12 years in 2 patients and the shortest 1 year in 1 Recurrences andor metastases developed in 4 of 7 patients between 1 and 9 years after initial resection Recurrences were treated by reexcision in addition to radiation treatment and chemotherapy in 3 patients and reexcision with radiation treatment alone in 1 patient A review of the literature along with our experience suggests that thymic carcinoids have a biological behavior distinct from thymoma in terms of cell origin associated syndromes neoplastic behavior and prognosis An aggressive surgical approach with complete initial excision of the tumor and of subsequent recurrences along with radiation and probably chemotherapy is the best available treatment today
R74	Twodimensional gel electrophoresis was used to compare immunoprecipitated radiolabeled HLADR molecules synthesized by alveolar macrophages AM and blood monocytes BM of the same healthy nonsmoking volunteers No charge differences were noted by isoelectric focusing Molecular weight analysis of HLADR from AM revealed a complex pattern of radioactive spots differing slightly in molecular weight This pattern was apparent in both the alpha and the beta chains In contrast a simpler pattern without the slight molecular weight differences was noted in HLADR from BM The differences were eliminated by labeling AM and BM in the presence of tunicamycin a specific inhibitor of proteincarbohydrate linkages of the Nglycosidic type Thus it appears that neutral Nlinked carbohydrate moieties account for the differences in HLADR molecules between AM and BM The differential glycosylation of HLADR molecules in AM and BM may relate to mononuclear phagocyte development as well as antigenpresenting function
R75	We report a rapid technique based on the polymerase chain reaction PCR for the direct targeting enhancement and sequencing of previously uncharacterized cDNAs This method is not limited to previously sequenced transcripts since it requires only two adjacent or partially overlapping specific primers from only one side of the region to be amplified These primers can be located anywhere within the message The specific primers are used in conjunction with nonspecific primers targeted either to the polyA region of the message or to an enzymatically synthesized dA tail Pairwise combinations of specific and general primers allow for the amplification of regions both 3 and 5 to the point of entry into the message The amplified PCR products can be cloned sequenced directly by genomic sequencing or labeled for sequencing by amplifying with a radioactive primer We illustrate the power of this approach by deriving the cDNA sequences for the skeletal muscle alphatropomyosins of European common frog Rana temporaria and zebrafish Brachydanio rerio using only 300 ng of a total polyA preparation In these examples we gained initial entry into the tropomyosin messages by using heterologous primers to conserved regions derived from the rat skeletal muscle alphatropomyosin sequence The frog and zebrafish sequences are used in an analysis of tropomyosin evolution across the vertebrate phylogenetic spectrum The results underscore the conservative nature of the tropomyosin molecule and support the notion of a constrained heptapeptide unit as the fundamental structural motif of tropomyosin
R76	Radial scar a sclerosing ductal breast lesion characterized by an irregular stellate pattern of epithelial proliferation around a central fibroelastic core may be confused histologically with scirrhous carcinoma of the breast Mammographic features used to distinguish these two entities were found unreliable in a retrospective review of 255 consecutive stellate lesions Of 73 nonpalpable carcinomas fourteen 19 had radiographic features of radial scar Only the presence of microcalcifications in 11 of those patients helped the authors distinguish carcinoma from radial scars Four of nine biopsyproved radial scars had a dense central region simulating the appearance of scirrhous carcinoma Stellate lesions with radiolucent centers should be considered suggestive of carcinoma particularly if associated with microcalcifications
R77	The best management of fetal hydronephrosis is controversial Despite the lack of experimental evidence that prenatal drainage of the obstructed urinary tract substantially improves ultimate renal function various forms of percutaneous intervention on the fetal bladder and kidney have been used To evaluate the efficacy of intervention for suspected fetal obstructive uropathy all published reports of drainage of the fetal urinary tract up to December 1985 were reviewed In the 57 reported cases the most common type of intervention was placement of a vesicoamniotic shunt 37 Complications occurred in 25 cases 44 including inadequate shunt drainage or migration 19 onset of premature labour within 48 h 12 urinary ascites 7 and chorioamnionitis 5 Of 28 fetuses with associated oligohydramnios only 6 21 survived 2 of these survivors had vesicoamniotic shunts 2 single or multiple bladder aspirations 1 an external renal drainage catheter and 1 inutero vesicostomy Because of the high complication rate and lack of evidence of improved survival from inutero drainage procedures a prospective randomised trial is needed to compare survival with and without vesicoamniotic shunt placement
R78	15 patients with acromegaly were treated with continuous subcutaneous infusion of octreotide in increasing dose from 200 to 1600 micrograms per 24 h by 200 micrograms increments each week Patients were studied during the initial 7 h of infusion weekly at each dose level then after 1 and 2 months at maximum dosage 13 patients responded well as judged by growth hormone GH suppression and return of insulinlike growth factor 1 to normal although 1 patient withdrew due to adverse effects 2 patients showed no significant reduction in GH In the 12 responders GH level fell within the first 3 h of infusion at a mean plasma octreotide level of 076 SE 026 microgramsl corresponding to 25 micrograms of infused drug Optimum suppression of GH occurred at a dosage of 600 micrograms per 24 h a plasma drug level of 35 05 microgramsl A definite reduction in tumour size was seen on computerised tomographic scan in 2 patients All responders noted subjective improvement in acromegalic symptoms Adverse effects comprised gastrointestinal disturbances which were transient and mild in 14 patients but severe in 1 biliary sludging occurred in 1 patient No significant deterioration in carbohydrate tolerance was seen in the responders
R79	Hemodynamic changes in portal blood flow were investigated in 56 patients with hepatic tumors who underwent partial hepatectomy Portal flow was measured with a Doppler ultrasound system before during and after surgery The portal flow of patients who underwent massive hepatectomy decreased intraoperatively The portal flow per unit of cardiac output decreased in patients who underwent massive or major hepatectomy patients with a cirrhotic liver and patients who had a satisfactory postoperative course Postoperatively the portal flow in patients with a poor clinical outcome multiple organ failure hepatic failure and cardiorespiratory failure decreased significantly Monitoring portal hemodynamic values appears to be useful in providing an index of hepatic functional reserve Adequate portal flow is essential for postoperative hepatic regeneration changes in portal hemodynamic values may be directly related to the patients ability to survive surgery and to regain or maintain normal liver function
R80	Early fibrinolytic therapy with full molecular tissue plasminogen activator tPA has been observed to be both angiographically and clinically effective when employed in animal stroke models Preliminary clinical trials with tPA are in progress It is possible to refine tPA by developing fragments or analogues of the drug Using recombinant DNA technology in the Escherichia coli system a tPA analogue consisting of the catalytic fragment of tPA and a dimer of the B fragment of staphylococcal protein A FbFbCF has been produced Because this analogue has a long serum halflife of 90 minutes we employed FbFbCF in a rabbit cerebral embolic stroke model to assess its efficacy as a reperfusion agent When given as a bolus to 10 animals 15 minutes after embolization FbFbCF produced angiographic cerebral reperfusion in 48  21 minutes  SD while in 8 salinetreated controls reperfusion was not observed at 180 minutes in any animal p less than 001 In another experiment reperfusion was demonstrated at 66  32 minutes in 11 animals treated with FbFbCF 90 minutes after embolization as compared with 100  25 minutes in 12 salinetreated controls p less than 001 A small macroscopic hemorrhage within an infarct was seen in 1 FbFbCFtreated animal in the 15minute experiment and in none of the controls In the 90minute experiment macroscopic hemorrhagic infarction was seen in 4 FbFbCFtreated animals and in 3 controlsABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R81	A coupling between the lateral flexion and axial rotation as a result of the geometric arrangement of the motion segments is well known in a normal spine The kinematic behavior of idiopathic scoliotic spines has been analyzed by means of a biomechanical model study and a radiologic study The anteroposterior and lateral flexion radiographs of 40 patients with progressive adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were studied In five of these patients anteroposterior radiographs were also made with the spine in a ventrally flexed position The kinematic behavior of a nonpathologic spine was examined by means of a threedimensional nonlinear geometric mathematical model of the spine The frontal plane inclination of the facet joints in conjunction with the vertebral orientation in the sagittal plane influence the kinematic behavior in the normal spine In a scoliotic spine there is an axially rotated position and in most cases a dorsal inclination lordotic of the motion segments Nevertheless the direction of the axial rotation during lateral flexion does not differ from the direction of the axial rotation during lateral flexion in a normal spine The existing axial rotation in idiopathic scoliosis cannot be explained on the basis of spinal kinematics In contrast to normal spines in scoliotic spines exists a coupling between ventral flexion or extension and axial rotation This may be essential in the management of idiopathic scoliosis
R82	Acclimation of rock pigeon Columba livia to high ambient temperature Ta 50 degrees C from the time of hatching resulted in a welldeveloped cutaneous evaporative cooling mechanism CECM which became the dominant mechanism for heat dissipation After the age of 15 days and in adults acclimated pigeons exposed to 4860 degrees C Ta could regulate normal body temperature Tb without employing either panting or gular fluttering Respiration rate varied between 36  12 SD and 35  14 breathsmin at moderate and at extreme high Tas respectively During thermal stress 42 45 and 47 degrees C imposed in a metabolic chamber nonpanting pigeons heat balance was achieved by adjusting lowlevel heat production 462  68 Wm2 and by use of an efficient CECM that dissipated 145 of the metabolic heat Tb was regulated between 407  05 and 418  04 degrees C over a wide range of Tas 2056 degrees C The respiratory evaporative cooling mechanism RECM was effective since hatching The CECM developed approximately 24 h later during the ontogeny of the altricial nestling pigeon This trait which exists in many bird species and may be a recent development possibly evolved as an adaptation to hot environments In the present study we have brought evidence for a multitrait physiological adaptation that takes preeminence in adjusting the processes involved in maintaining heat balance This integrative complex creates a powerful efficient tool for contending with the most extreme thermal conditions
R83	Antagonism of atracuriuminduced neuromuscular blockade with neostigmine one or two doses of 25 mg was compared using electromyography with spontaneous recovery Two levels of blockade were studied one in which the initial response of the trainoffour has reached 10 of control and the other 50 of control Adequate recovery was considered to be present when the ratio of the fourth response to the first trainoffour ratio had reached 70 Neostigmine always accelerated recovery and neostigmine block was not detected This acceleration of recovery after neostigmine was most marked with the greater degree of blockade but two doses of neostigmine were no more effective than one Spontaneous recovery to the trainoffour ratio of 70 was slow in the order of 1 h after an initial dose of 05 mg kg1 and 45 min after incremental doses of 02 mg kg1 It is concluded that antagonism of atracurium with one dose of neostigmine is usually desirable that two doses are unnecessary and that spontaneous recovery is slower than is generally realized
R84	A Raman spectrometer multiple gas analyzer was used to monitor inspired and expired concentrations of oxygen O2 nitrogen N2 carbon dioxide CO2 nitrous oxide N2O halothane and isoflurane in 10 patients The Raman spectrometer and a dedicated mass spectrometer were connected to each patient to provide a comparison of the two instruments Results show that readings from the Raman spectrometer are within 062 vol of known gas standards for O2 N2 N2O within 003 vol for CO2 and within 004 vol for halothane enflurane and isoflurane Clinical results show that Raman spectrometer readings are within 136 vol of the mass spectrometer readings for O2 N2 N2O within 001 vol for CO2 and within 022 vol for halothane and isoflurane The clinical and laboratory results indicate the Raman spectrometer monitors airway gases and vapors as accurately as a dedicated mass spectrometer
R85	Sexual dysfunction is so highly prevalent in elderly males that it is often considered an inevitable consequence of normal aging To determine if other factors are related to an ageassociated decline in sexual function we surveyed two groups of elderly male veterans in a geriatric ambulatory care clinic aged 65 to 75 years youngold and aged over 75 oldold We compared their survey responses with responses from a general medical clinic for unstable medical patients aged under 65 oldyoung Of 347 subjects surveyed 225 completed a health and sexual function questionnaire response rate  65 Absent libido was reported by 30 of oldyoung 31 of youngold and 47 of oldold Erectile dysfunction was reported in 26 of oldyoung 27 of youngold and 50 of oldold P less than 01 We used ordinal logistic regression and found overall sexual dysfunction to be significantly related to subjective poor health diabetes mellitus and incontinence P less than 05 while controlling for age These data suggest that although sexual dysfunction is more common in the aged it is often related more to comorbid illness than aging alone
R86	Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis EAE a T cellmediated autoimmune disease can be transferred with lymphoid cells from actively immunized rats into naive recipients In the mouse previous studies have suggested a role for histamineserotonin in the development of active EAE We have found that myelin basic proteinreactive cells transfer a biphasic skin test response to naive rats analogous to what has been described in the mouse contact dermatitis system where mast cell sensitization by Agspecific T cell factors is required for the induction of skin test responses Treatment of cell recipients with the serotonin receptor antagonists cyproheptadine or methysergide blocked or significantly reduced the development of EAE Furthermore it was found that treatment with cyproheptadine was effective in blocking clinical disease when administered day 3 to day 6 after cell transfer In contrast cyproheptadine treatments before induction of paralysis day 0 to 3 failed to alter the course of clinical disease The inhibitor of mast cell degranulation proxicromil was also found to effectively block the elicitation of adoptively transferred EAE and was also found to be effective when administered just before the onset of clinical disease Reserpine a compound known to deplete mast cells of vasoactive amines by forcing granule contents into the cytoplasm where they are degraded by cell enzymes was also effective in blocking both active and adoptively transferred EAE Disease inhibition was found to be partially reversed with pargyline an inhibitor of monoamine oxidase In addition lymphocytes from treated animals were capable of transferring disease to naive recipients and appeared to have normal activity as assessed by Agor mitogendriven proliferation in addition to IL2 production
R87	The frequency content of muscular sound MS detected by placing a contact sensor transducer over the belly of the biceps brachii during 10 isometric contractions of 4 s each 10100 of maximal voluntary contraction MVC in seven sedentary men was analyzed by the maximum entropy spectral estimation and the fast Fourier transform methods With increasing MVC the power spectrum of the MS enlarges and tends to be multimodal beyond 30 MVC Independent of the method the mean frequency is approximately 11 Hz at the lower tasks and then it increases up to 15 Hz at 80 MVC and to 22 Hz at 100 MVC When the effort is increased the relative power in the 15 to 45Hz bandwidth range of firing rate of the motor units with fasttwitch fibers from 20 reaches 55 of the power in the 6 to 45Hz bandwidth firing rate range of motor units with slow and fasttwitch fibers Our results obtained by the two different modeling approaches confirm the reliability of the sound signal Moreover it appears that from the MS the motor unit activation pattern can be retrieved
R88	We studied the interrelationships between insulin resistance obesity and abnormal ovarian androgen secretion in chronically anovulatory women with clinical or biochemical evidence of hyperandrogenism Four groups of six subjects each were studied 1 normal weight within 10 ideal body weight anovulatory 2 obese greater than 120 ideal body weight anovulatory 3 normal weight eumenorrheic and 4 obese eumenorrheic After dexamethasone suppression human chorionic gonadotropin 2000 IU15m2 body surface area intramuscularly was administered to each subject Serum testosterone levels were subsequently determined hourly for 17 hours On a separate occasion an oral glucose tolerance test was administered to five subjects from each group Serum glucose and immunoreactive insulin levels were determined before and after the ingestion of a standard 100 gm glucose load As a group the anovulatory women had higher p less than 005 basal testosterone levels 1005  97 pgml than did the ovulatory women 241  21 pgml values  SE Obesity per se was not associated with increased basal testosterone levels Testosterone levels rose in response to human chorionic gonadotropin p less than 0005 only in obese anovulatory women reached maximal levels after 3 hours and subsequently remained stable Basal immunoreactive insulin levels were elevated p less than 005 only in obese anovulatory women 524  20 microUml compared with obese eumenorrheic 87  10 microUml normal weight anovulatory 58  24 microUml and normal weight eumenorrheic 46  04 microUml women Similarly maximal increases in immunoreactive insulin levels after glucose ingestion were significantly greater p less than 001 in obese anovulatory women compared with other groups Of note is the observation that maximal changes in testosterone observed within the first 3 hours after human chorionic gonadotropin and maximal changes in insulin were correlated r  091 p less than 001 These data suggest that 1 both insulin resistance and an abnormal acute response to human chorionic gonadotropin are seen only in obese anovulatory women and 2 the degree to which these two abnormalities are manifested is clearly correlated The mechanisms responsible for this interrelationship as well as the underlying causes of these biochemical defects remain to be elucidated
R89	The infectivity immunogenicity and efficacy of live attenuated influenza ATexas185 H1N1 and ABethesda185 H3N2 avianhuman ah and coldadapted ca reassortant vaccines were compared in 252 seronegative adult volunteers The immunogenicity and efficacy of the H1N1 reassortant vaccine were also compared with those of the trivalent inactivated virus vaccine Each reassortant vaccine was satisfactorily attenuated The 50 human infectious dose was 1049 for ca H1N1 1054 for ah H1N1 1064 for ca H3N2 and 1065 TCID50 for ah H3N2 reassortant virus Within a subtype the immunogenicities of ah and ca vaccines were comparable Five to seven weeks after vaccination volunteers were challenged with homologous wildtype influenza A virus The magnitude of shedding of virus after challenge was greater than 100fold less in H1N1 vaccinees and greater than 10fold less in H3N2 vaccinees compared with unimmunized controls The vaccines were equally efficacious as indicated by an 86100 reduction in illness Thus the ah AMallardNew York675078 and the ca AAnn Arbor660 reassortant viruses are comparable
R90	Hyperstimulation during fetal heart rate FHR monitoring occurs when a deceleration in the FHR accompanies a contraction lasting greater than 90 seconds or contractions more frequent than every 2 minutes A posthyperstimulation contraction stress test CST was performed and if it was reactive negative the next days test was evaluated On the next day 170250 68 of the tests were reactive negative 33200 13 of the patients underwent labor induction 28250 11 of the tests had hyperstimulation patterns again and 19250 8 of the tests were reactive equivocal there were no positive tests In this series of 250 repeat tests there were no adverse outcomes in patients who had a reactive negative CST after a hyperstimulation pattern suggesting that the second test can be performed in a week rather than in a day
R91	We describe 2 patients with an absent segment of the bulbomembranous urethra in 1 of whom the defect extended from the triangular ligament to the scrotal area A simple method to restore continuity is presented which is applicable to a wide variety of conditions resulting in the absence of a long segment of the bulbomembranous urethra
R92	Shortpulse saturation recovery electron spin resonance methods have been used to measure lateral diffusion of nitroxidelabeled lipids in multilamellar liposomal dispersions Nitroxides with 14N and 15N isotopes introduced both separately and together were used Differential equations have been written and solved for complex saturation recovery signals involving several superimposed exponentials The time constants contain various combinations of the spinlattice relaxation time T1e for both isotopes Heisenberg exchange rates and nuclear spinlattice relaxation times T1n Signals of high quality were fitted by Monte Carlo variation of the amplitudes and time constants The reliability of the approach was tested extensively by verifying that i the predicted number of exponentials agreed with the experimental number ii relaxation parameters that were determined were independent of the observed hyperfine transition iii the time constants were independent of saturating pulse length iv T1e and T1n do not change when Heisenberg exchange is changed by varying the concentration and v Heisenberg exchange is indeed proportional to the concentration It has been established that bimolecular collision rates over a wide range of conditions can be reliably measured using the methodology described here The methods depend on the favorable match of bimolecular collision rates at micromolar concentrations to nitroxide spinlattice relaxation probabilities
R93	Extendedwear contact lenses EWCL are being used increasingly for the correction of aphakia in infants but there is a lack of data documenting their effects on the corneas of young children Therefore corneal studies were performed on infant monkeys wearing EWCL for the correction of surgical aphakia Nine newborn monkeys underwent unilateral lensectomy and anterior vitrectomy Seven eyes were fitted with aphakic EWCL postoperatively and two wore no lenses After at least six months corneas were studied with slitlamp and specular microscopy and with light microscopy LM and electron microscopy EM Small central corneal opacities developed in two aphakic eyes corrected with EWCL after episodes of keratoconjunctivitis One of these corneas was found to have a mildly increased coefficient of variation CV of endothelial cell size polymegathism Although EWCL are well tolerated by the corneas of aphakic infant primates their association with endothelial polymegathism which may indicate physiologic compromise mandates careful longterm followup
R94	Dystrophin is the gene product that is affected in Duchenne muscular dystrophy DMD Antibodies against dystrophin were used to study the protein in muscle fibers of carriers of the gene The results showed that DMD carriers have normal and dystrophindeficient fibers Dystrophin immunohistochemistry may be helpful for the detection of DMD carriers
R95	In two infants with distal renal tubular acidosis phosphate depletion was observed in the extracellular and intracellular compartments of the erythrocytes Treatment corrected this disturbance over a period of several months Cell phosphate deficiency may contribute to the adverse effects of renal tubular acidosis on bone
R96	Despite a high level of concern among health professionals and the general public data are inadequate to define and monitor the prevalence of severe pediatric undernutrition SPUN The Centers for Disease Control is supporting four state health departments to test the feasibility of surveillance mechanisms for SPUN These efforts will seek to develop workable case definitions define prevalence estimates identify highrisk populations and describe specific demographic social and medical risk factors Initial experience with SPUN surveillance indicates that a variety of approaches may prove feasible but that these require attention to issues such as measurement error data collection burden confidentiality and data management SPUN surveillance may prove too costly to be practical for general application but it can serve as a means to identify needy children and estimate the prevalence of undernutrition in specific highrisk populations
R97	Patients with CF may develop hypoxemia which seems disproportionate to the degree of pulmonary disease In a series of patients with CF and advanced pulmonary disease undergoing transesophageal echocardiography for the evaluation of cor pulmonale eight of 15 patients were found to have atrial shunts through a stretched foramen ovale To our knowledge this is the first observation of intracardiac shunting in CF This phenomenon may account for unexplained levels of cyanosis and worsening of hypoxemia with exercise vasodilators or PEEP and poses the threat of paradoxic emboli when central venous lines are used in these patients
R98	Two women with typical stiffman syndrome SMS developed increasingly frequent attacks of muscle spasms with severe paroxysmal autonomic dysfunctions such as transient hyperpyrexia diaphoresis tachypnea tachycardia pupillary dilation and arterial hypertension Autoantibodies to GABAergic neurons were identified in the serum of both patients and in the cerebrospinal fluid of one Both died suddenly and unexpectedly General autopsy did not reveal the cause of death Neuropathological studies revealed perivascular gliosis in the spinal cord and brain stem of one patient and lymphocytic perivascular infiltration in the spinal cord brain stem and basal ganglia of the other The occurrence of a chronic inflammatory reaction in one of the two patients supports the idea that an autoimmune disease against GABAergic neurons may be involved in SMS A review of the literature indicates that functional impairment in SMS is severe and prognosis is unpredictable because of the potential for sudden and unexpected death Both muscular abnormalities and autonomic dysfunctions may result from autoimmunity directed against GABAergic neurons
R99	We studied the relationship between ventricular size and nonspecific periventricular lucency on computed tomograms leukoaraiosis in 192 patients with ischemic stroke Leukoaraiosis did not occur in 21 patients less than 50 years of age ventricular size could not be measured in an additional 29 Leukoaraiosis was graded from 0 to 4 on a semiquantitative scale bicaudate frontal horn and posterior horn indices were used as measures of ventricular size Patients with leukoaraiosis were older difference between means 7 years t  53 df  140 p less than 00001 and had larger bicaudate indices difference between means 0023 t  354 df  140 p  00007 than patients without leukoaraiosis Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that the effects of age and leukoaraiosis were independent No effect of lesion type cortical or lacunar infarct or both on bicaudate index could be demonstrated Larger values for the bicaudate index were associated with a predominantly anterior location of leukoaraiosis The frontal horn and occipital horn indices increased with age but we could not find an effect of leukoaraiosis on these indices
R100	Serial biannual crosssectional assessments of HIV sexual risk indicated a consistent increase in safer sexual practices among homosexual men participating in the ChicagoMulticenter AIDS Cohort Study MACSCoping and Change Study CCS in 19861988 Safer sexual practices were achieved by avoidance of anal sex and less often by consistent use of condoms Longitudinal patterns of variability in individual behavior were also assessed After 1 year of followup 53 of the participants maintained safer practices in receptive anal sex 6 maintained unsafe practices while 31 relapsed at least once After 2 years 45 maintained safer practices 3 maintained unsafe practices and 47 relapsed at least once Similar trends were observed in insertive anal sex
R101	The effect of cyclosporin administered from 30 to 100 days of age on pancreatic events and the development of insulindependent diabetes has been studied by serial pancreatic biopsy of individual diabetesprone BBEdinburgh rats Cyclosporin completely prevented the development of diabetes up to 150 days of age and reduced the incidence to 50 of controls at 452 days of age Islet cell surface antibodies paralleled the development of diabetes Insulin autoantibodies were unrelated to diabetes and not affected by cyclosporin Immunohistochemical analysis of pancreatic biopsies from untreated control diabetesprone rats with monoclonal antibodies specific for rat MHC molecules and T and Blymphocyte and macrophage subsets showed that the first abnormality seen in rats that subsequently developed diabetes was hyperexpression of MHC class I molecules on vascular endothelium and islet cells This was followed by accumulation of ED1 macrophages at perivascular and periductal sites adjacent to noninfiltrated islets Increased expression of MHC class II molecules on vascular endothelial cells was also noted Most cells infiltrating the islets initially were also ED1 macrophages followed by increasing numbers of other activated effector cells including helper and cytotoxicsuppressor T lymphocytes and natural killer cells Obliteration of insulincontaining cells was associated with regression of the infiltrate Treatment with cyclosporin had no effect on pancreatic hyperexpression of MHC class I molecules but markedly inhibited accumulation of ED1 cells at extraislet sites the subsequent recruitment of immune effector cells and islet infiltration This resulted in a delay of the onset of diabetes in some rats and prevention of diabetes in others
R102	Overexpression of the D2 dopamine receptor has been proposed to be part of the pathology of schizophrenia The isolation of a D2 dopamine receptor clone has assisted the molecular characterization of D2 receptor We have now isolated an identical rat clone along with two other clonesa second related rat clone RD2in and a homologous bovine clone BD2in both of which contain an insert encoding an additional 29 amino acids relative to the original rat clone RD2o All three clones encode D2 receptor binding sites when expressed in COS7 cells The aminoacid insert encoded by D2in lies in the domain of the receptor believed to interact with the GTPbinding proteins G proteins of various signal transduction pathways By using oligonucleotide probes specific for either D2o or D2in RNA transcripts we have found that the level of expression of the D2inencoded form of the receptor is seven times that of the D2o form in the caudate nucleus the richest brain source of D2 receptors
R103	The art of medicine is struggling for survival in medical education practice and research The authors embrace the biopsychosocial model as an ideal new paradigm for medicine and propose that the family systems approach provides the best available vehicle for applying the biopsychosocial model to everyday medical practice and research Such an approach would require major changes in the way health care is delivered and offers both benefits and risks for family physicians to consider One important change would involve the sharing of physicians power in a health care system that emphasizes collaboration among individuals families and a variety of professionals Such revolutionary changes should be approached with caution
R104	The case of the sudden unexpected death of a 21yearold man due to embolization of segments of an aortic valve papillary fibroma to the left main and anterior descending coronary artery is presented The literature regarding cardiac papillary fibroma is reviewed with particular reference to those cases associated with sudden death
R105	This study was undertaken to test the hypothesis that the induction of a clot layer on the graft surface of microvascular polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE prostheses might improve their healing PTFE microvascular prostheses n  18 mechanically roughened PTFE microvascular prostheses n  18 and Chitosanimpregnated PTFE microvascular prostheses n  18 all prostheses length 1 cm inside diameter 15 mm fibril length 30 microns were implanted into the abdominal aortas of rats and were evaluated at 3 days n  3 10 days n  3 3 weeks n  6 and 6 weeks n  6 with regard to the presence or absence of a clot layer and with regard to the amount of graft healing All untreated PTFE prostheses were never found to be covered with a clot layer only scarcely with some platelets and showed poor neoendothelial healing even at 6 weeks after implantation there was only endothelial cell coverage near the anastomotic sides coverage  19  4 percent The endothelial cells were present directly on the graft surface In contrast both the roughened and the Chitosanimpregnated PTFE prostheses were completely covered with a thin clot layer upon implantation and demonstrated significantly better neoendothelial healing endothelial cell coverage at 6 weeks  76  22 percent and 75  18 percent respectively p less than 0001 moreover in these prostheses the endothelial cells were present on a matrix of smoothmuscle cells which covered the graft surface completely These results confirm our hypothesis that the induction of a clot layer on the graft surface of microvascular PTFE prostheses improves their healingABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R106	We devised a technique that permitted elevation of pulmonary pressures in unanesthetized sheep by occluding their pulmonary veins Using this technique we raised pulmonary capillary pressure from a baseline of 132  22 to 353  51 mmHg This increased lung lymph flow from 88  27 to 531  139 mlh We estimated the pulmonary microvascular oncotic reflection coefficient and found it to be 082  005 SD The filtration coefficient was 0019  0005 mlmmHg1min1 During the period of increased pressure the animals had stable arterial pressures and cardiac outputs None of the animals developed blood coagulation problems These data illustrate the usefulness of pulmonary venous occlusion to elevate pulmonary microvascular pressure to obtain plasmatolymph protein concentration ratios independent of flow allowing for the calculation of the oncotic reflection coefficient
R107	A rare case of diffuse large cell lymphoma DLL arising in the stomach of a patient with longstanding chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL has been examined by a combination of immunophenotypic and gene probe methods Both the resected lymphoma and the CLL obtained from an infiltrate in perigastric lymph nodes expressed surface membrane markers consistent with a Bcell origin HLADR B1 B4 but surface membrane immunoglobulin SmIg could be detected only on the CLL cells SmIgM lambda Neither neoplasm expressed cytoplasmic immunoglobulin DNA probe analysis using the Southern blot method and probes to the joining JH region of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene and to the constant C regions of the immunoglobulin kappa and lambda light chain genes revealed different light and heavy chain gene rearrangements in the two neoplasms These findings suggest that the large cell lymphoma arose from a different clone than the CLL and the development of large cell lymphoma may have represented a de novo neoplastic event in a predisposed person
R108	Zidovudine was present in the semen and serum of six patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or the related complex who were receiving 200 mg of the drug orally every four to six hours Mean semen zidovudine levels as measured by a new radioimmunoassay in samples collected 075 to 125 hours after oral dosing were 363 to 719 mumolL Levels in semen samples collected 30 to 45 hours after oral dosing were 168 to 643 mumolL These values are above the in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration for the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV1 Mean serum concentrations at the early and late times after oral dosing were 022 to 307 mumolL and 010 to 142 mumolL respectively Ratios of semenserum zidovudine levels ranged from 13 to 204 It is possible that a pHdependent trapping mechanism which has been described in the prostate for other antibiotics was responsible for the relatively high semen levels observed
R109	Cardiac norepinephrine turnover and metabolism were examined in rats 8 weeks after the induction of chronic diabetes by an intravenous injection of streptozotocin 65 mgkg Cardiac norepinephrine concentration norepinephrine turnover and norepinephrine uptake were markedly increased in chronic diabetes in comparison with control values these changes were reversible by 28day insulin therapy When the animals were exposed to cold for 6 hours norepinephrine turnover rate constant increased in control and decreased in diabetic animals cold exposure also increased norepinephrine concentration in diabetic hearts Both cardiac norepinephrine concentration and turnover rate in diabetic rats were restored toward control values by ganglionic blockade with pentolinium The conversion of 3Htyrosine to 3Hcatecholamine was enhanced and tyrosine hydroxylase as well as dopa decarboxylase activities were increased in diabetic hearts The higher concentrations of 3Hnormetanephrine and deaminated catechols indicated a faster metabolic rate of norepinephrine metabolism in hearts from diabetic rats both monoamine oxidase and catecholOmethyltransferase activities were also increased The increased activities of the enzymes for the synthesis and metabolism of norepinephrine were not evident on treating the diabetic animals with insulin These data not only support the view that chronic diabetes in rats is associated with increased sympathetic activity but also indicate that the cardiac norepinephrine concentration in diabetic rats may be maintained at a higher than normal level by an increased synthesis and uptake of norepinephrine in the adrenergic nerve terminals
R110	Family physicians are often in close contact with utilization review programs Traditional hospital based review programs have included prehospital certification outpatient and sameday surgery second opinions concurrent hospital review and early discharge planning The role of utilization review in ambulatory care is expected to increase in the future and will focus on the costeffective allocation of resources Family physicians need to be aware of several issues as they interact with utilization review programs including the preservation of confidentiality financial obligation in the face of negative review decisions and the effect of utilization review on liability for adverse outcomes Family medicine education should encourage familiarity with the structure and function of review programs and should enable practitioners to participate intelligently in such programs
R111	The vasoactive intestinal peptide VIP receptor in membranes from rat submandibular gland was studied using radioligand binding assays with 125IVIP and various unlabeled competing ligands In addition to the necessity of working within the parameters under which all radioligand binding assays should be performed binding studies with 125IVIP as with other peptide hormones and neurotransmitters are subject to additional technical difficulties Specific problems that were addressed included radioligand proteolysis the identification of an effective protease inhibitor leupeptin and the deleterious effects of a commonly used inhibitor bacitracin avid radioligand absorption to incubation tubes that was eliminated by precoating of the tubes with a combination of polyethylenimine and an organosilane and a disproportionate effect of increasing membrane protein concentration on affinity estimates Under optimized conditions the affinity Kd and density Bmax values for 125IVIP obtained from saturation assays 76 pM 20 pmolmg were in excellent agreement Membrane protein or receptor levels beyond the linear portion of the receptor concentration curve are often used in radioligand binding assays Results from 125IVIP binding studies at elevated receptor concentrations revealed the predicted marked decrease in receptor affinity In addition the rank order potency of unlabeled ligands in inhibition binding assays was changed The optimization of the assay for measuring VIP receptors in submandibular gland membrane provides a reliable method for studying the role of receptor regulation in stimulussecretion coupling for this neuropeptide
R112	A model of human allergic disease in which nonhuman primates were infused with serum from allergic humans and challenged with appropriate antigen was used to determine whether the animals also develop hyperreactive airways characteristic of asthma Anesthetized monkeys were insufflated with increasing concentrations of methacholine aerosol and changes in pulmonary function were measured Airway reactivity as assessed by the dose of methacholine aerosol culminating in apnea was determined after infusion of serum from allergic or nonallergic humans or with heated allergic serum A comparison of the results indicated that only infusion of unheated serum from allergic humans resulted in an increase in airway reactivity to aerosolized methacholine These results suggest that a factor in the serum of allergic humans may play a role in the hyperreactivity of airways characteristic of asthma
R113	The purpose of this study was to establish whether a correlation exists between childrens birth weight and their scholastic achievements in high school This correlation has previously only been investigated only in primary school children and it was felt that it would be interesting to observe whether schooling changed the known status The records of 718 children were reviewed and there appears to be a statistically significant disability for low birth weight children in the study of exact sciences and foreign languages whilst no significant differences were noted in the humanities and sport
R114	This study describes the use of Ascan ultrasound for the measurement and characterization of tumour tissue in small skin tumoursbasal cell carcinoma melanocytic naevus hypertrophic scars and intraepidermal epithelioma Assessment of the Ascan traces by measurement of i the amplitude of echoes within the area of interest ii the density number per unit depth of these echoes iii the regularity of spacing and amplitude of the echoes and iv the amplitude of echoes beneath the area of interest was used to assist in the differential diagnosis The results show significant differences in echo amplitude between all the tumours and normal skin When the tumour Ascan traces were analysed the results indicated that the best discriminating feature between tumours was that of amplitude followed by regularity density nonnormalized thickness and finally amplitude of echoes from beneath the tumour Ultrasoundderived skin thickness measurements were compared to histological measurements for the lesions and an excellent correlation was found r  096 It was considered that the Ascan ultrasound investigation of small tumours of the skin was able to provide information on the nature of the tissues contained and may assist in their differential diagnosis
R115	This study was undertaken to investigate whether the quality of magnetic resonance images of the temporomandibular joint could be improved by scanning in oblique planes oriented according to the individual angle of the mandibular condyle oblique images instead of in the true anatomic sagittal and coronal planes orthogonal images Sagittal and coronal magnetic resonance images obtained by both methods in 21 patients were compared for image quality of the disk In more than half the patients the oblique images demonstrated the anatomy of the disk better than the orthogonal images Oblique images are therefore recommended
R116	We developed a series of methodology to analyze functionstructure relationship at single nephron level in animal models of chronic renal disease Micropuncture measurements were repeated to measure single nephron GFR SNGFR and glomerular capillary hydraulic pressure PGC in the same nephrons and subsequently examine the morphology of these glomeruli by serial section histological analysis Using this approach a potential causal link between early functional pattern and late structural abnormalities was examined in glomeruli of 10 MunichWistar rats up to six weeks after surgical removal of 56 total renal mass After two weeks all SNGFR and PGC values increased uniformly but to varying degrees within each remnant kidney Thereafter values for SNGFR were highly variable many declining while other increased in the same kidney PGC showed an initial increase with subsequent decrease by four to six weeks Serial section histological analysis of these same glomeruli revealed that the extent of glomerular sclerosis positively correlated with the functional deterioration that is the degree of reduction in SNGFR P less than 001 However the degree of sclerosis had no tendency to correlate with the levels of SNGFR or PGC recorded in early stage These studies indicate that pathophysiologic mechanisms other than or in addition to early hyperfunction are involved in determining the extent of glomerular structural damage in this model of chronic renal failure
R117	Using the technique of DNA fingerprinting we investigated the genetic structure within and among four wildcaught colonies n  50 individuals of a eusocial mammal the naked molerat Heterocephalus glaber Rodentia Bathyergidae We found that DNA fingerprints of colonymates were strikingly similar and that between colonies they were much more alike than fingerprints of nonkin in other freeliving vertebrates Extreme genetic similarity within colonies is due to close genetic relationship mean relatedness estimate  SE r  081  010 which apparently results from consanguineous mating The inbreeding coefficient F  045  018 is the highest yet recorded among wild mammals The genetic structure of naked molerat colonies lends support to kin selection and ecological constraints models for the evolution of cooperative breeding and eusociality

R119	Intraluminal pH monitoring in man should be performed with disposable multichannel assemblies that allow recordings at multiple sites and prevent transmission of infection Currently available glass electrodes are unsuitable for this purpose because of their size and price We have thus constructed and tested a small combined ion sensitive field effect transistor ISFET pH electrode incorporating an integral reference electrode In vitro studies showed that both ISFET and glass electrodes 440M4 Ingold Switzerland have a linear response over the pH range 1380 and that they are comparable with regard to response time and 24 hour drift Twenty one hour intragastric pH recordings were performed simultaneously in eight healthy volunteers using a glass electrode and an ISFET electrode placed no more than 2 mm apart in a combined assembly This was located in the gastric corpus under fluoroscopic control The 21 hour pH curves recorded by each electrode type showed identical patterns an early morning rise in pH with three mealassociated pH peaks lasting for about two to three hours The means of the 21 hour pH medians were 209 and 207 as measured by the glass and the ISFET electrodes respectively Thus ISFETs are suitable for the construction of inexpensive and hence disposable multichannel pH monitoring assemblies of small diameter Provided that they can be produced in large numbers with appropriate technical support ISFETs have the potential to replace glass electrodes for long term monitoring of gastrointestinal luminal acidity

R121	We describe a child who began developing subepidermal blisters in the recipient sites of splitthickness skin grafts this process has continued for almost a year and continues to spare nongrafted skin Routine histologic and immunofluorescence mapping studies demonstrated this disorder to be a relatively noninflammatory one characterized by sublamina densa blister formation Results of direct immunofluorescence were negative By electron microscopy anchoring fibrils were sparse in number and in some areas appeared malformed otherwise the basement membrane zone was morphologically unremarkable Bullous pemphigoid antigen laminin type IV collagen epidermolysis bullosa acquisita antigen and LDA1 were all normally expressed along the dermoepidermal junction In contrast KF1 antigen was absent These findings suggest a disease process confined to skin graft recipient sites with features identical to those previously described with recessive dystrophic or immunofluorescencenegative acquired epidermolysis bullosa
R122	Nine patients with a history of adenoid cystic carcinoma ACC arising in the head and neck and in whom transthoracic fineneedle aspiration FNA was performed to investigate pulmonary lesions are described FNA yielded a definitive diagnosis of metastatic ACC in all cases In six of the nine patients the pulmonary metastases were asymptomatic Lung lesions were discovered up to 19 years after primary tumor presentation and in two pulmonary spread was the only evidence of recurrent disease On the basis of the FNA diagnosis these two patients were treated surgically for their isolated pulmonary metastases and are disease free at 107 and 139 months Six of the nine patients received radiation or chemotherapy one initially refused treatment Thoracotomy was avoided in these patients on the basis of the FNA diagnosis All are alive with disease at 25 to 246 months The metastatic tumors were indistinguishable cytologically from two primary pulmonary ACCs that were available for comparison Our experience suggests FNA is a useful tool in the diagnosis of ACC in pulmonary materialone which obviates the need for thoracotomy with its associated morbidity
R123	The hazards related to ten patients who underwent 11 urologic surgical procedures during a 36 month period were taken into consideration Electrocautery was used in all instances and there were no complications All of the pacemakers were preset for ventricular pacing and sensing inhibited or multiprogrammable and were reprogrammed during the operation to ventricular pacing fixed rate mode or magnet mode with very satisfactory outcome To avoid lifethreatening situations arising from pacemaker inhibition or ventricular fibrillation during cautery for transuretheral resection three basic factors were considered 1 appropriate type of pacemaker 2 the proper grounding of all medical electronic equipment used during the procedure and 3 the directing of the complete flow of the electrocautery circuits substantially below the level of the pacemaker unit
R124	For 40 years the author has been developing a system of orthopedics traumatology and limb lengthening using a circular transfixionwire external skeletal fixator often in combination with biomechanic methods of stimulating the formation of new osseous tissue within a widening osteotomy distraction site The factors important for neoosteogenesis after osteotomy include maximum preservation of extraosseous and medullary blood supply stable external fixation a delay prior to distraction a distraction rate of 1 mm per day in frequent small steps a period of stable neutral fixation after lengthening and physiologic use of the elongating limb For a successful fixator application the apparatus must be applied with consideration given to the number size and location of the rings the placement and tension on the wires the technique of wire insertion the effect of softtissue transfixion on limb use and the prevention of bone and joint deformities caused by countertension in soft tissues Clinical application of the authors techniques permits stature increase in certain forms of dwarfism correction of deformities and limblength inequalities and stump elongation For many of these applications motorized distraction can provide continuous limb lengthening while the apparatus is on the patient

R126	Postmeningitic hearing loss is often bilateral profound and rapid in onset Children with postmeningitic hearing loss may be identified as potential candidates for cochlear implantation The length of time required for a definitive trial with conventional amplification which must precede a final decision regarding cochlear implant surgery has been the subject of debate Twentyfive children with bilateral severetoprofound postmeningitic sensorineural hearing loss were fitted with appropriate amplification and results of serialaided tests were analyzed to determine the degree of benefit and changes in aided thresholds over time Twelve children gave aided responses that clearly indicated the presence of residual hearing and good aided benefit Ten youngsters have responded consistently in the vibrotactile range when aided thus receiving limited benefit from conventional amplification Of particular interest are three children who initially exhibited limited or no auditory responses but who after a period of 16 to 25 months showed excellent benefit with binaural hearing aids These children are all in total communication programs and have received good auditory training Caution should be exercised when concluding that such a child does not benefit from amplification
R127	This study was carried out to test the hypothesis that adrenergic coronary vasoconstriction limits blood flow to hypoperfused regions of myocardium during exercise The vasoconstrictor influence of alphaadrenergic receptor subtypes was assessed by use of selective adrenergic blocking agents Dogs chronically instrumented with a circumflex coronary artery hydraulic occluder and an intraarterial catheter underwent treadmill exercise in the presence of a coronary stenosis that decreased distal perfusion pressure to 40 mm Hg Myocardial blood flow was measured with radioactive microspheres 15 microns before and during selective alpha 1 or alpha 2adrenergic receptor blockade produced by intracoronary infusion of prazosin 1 microgramkgmin x 10 min or idazoxan 1 microgramkgmin x 10 min respectively Coronary perfusion pressure was held equal before and during receptor blockade with the hydraulic occluder Compared with control exercise subendocardial blood flow increased during alpha 1receptor blockade with prazosin from 060  014 to 112  017 mlming p less than 005 and mean transmural flow increased from 107  019 to 160  022 mlming p less than 005 In contrast subendocardial and mean transmural blood flow were not different from control during selective alpha 2adrenergic receptor blockade with idazoxan 048  010 vs 067  014 mlming p  033 and 082  015 vs 102  020 mlming p  045 respectively These data indicate that even in the presence of a coronary stenosis that causes substantial myocardial underperfusion during exercise residual coronary vasoconstrictor tone is present in ischemic myocardium and this vasoconstriction is mediated predominantly by the alpha 1adrenergic receptor
R128	Amphibian eggs and embryos as well as mammalian cells have been reported to contain an activity that unwinds doublestranded RNA We have now found that adenosine residues have been modified in the RNA products of this unwinding activity Although the modified RNA remains doublestranded the modification causes the RNA to be susceptible to singlestrandspecific RNase and to migrate as a retarded smear on a native polyacrylamide electrophoresis gel The modification is specific for doublestranded RNA At least 40 of the adenosine residues can be modified in vitro in a given random sequence RNA molecule By using standard twodimensional TLC and HPLC analyses the modified base has been identified as inosine Mismatched basepairing between inosine and uridine appears to be responsible for the observed characteristics of the unwound RNA The biological significance of this modifying activity and also of the modified doublestranded RNA is discussed

R133	Blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery determined by transcranial Doppler ultrasonography was monitored during 31 carotid endarterectomies Electroencephalogram EEG was also monitored and regional cerebral blood flow rCBF was measured The relation between rCBF and mean velocity was dependent on the rCBF level the correlation was strong if rCBF was less than 20 ml100 gmin but weak if rCBF was greater than that level Ipsilateral EEG suppression was related to a rCBF threshold of 9 ml100 gmin and to a mean velocity threshold of 15 cmsec the rCBF threshold was more specific for EEG change Postischemic hyperemia was evident in measurements of mean velocity but not of rCBF These disparities between mean velocity and rCBF seemed to be due to three factors 1 disproportionately high mean velocity in patients with stenosis of the middle cerebral artery 2 a nonlinear relation between mean velocity and rCBF and 3 the anatomically different regions of the brain in which mean velocity and rCBF are measured The velocity measurement appeared to be relatively more sensitive than rCBF to hemodynamic events in the corpus striatum and internal capsule

R139	Certain sugars particularly trehalose dramatically alter physical properties of dry phospholipids in ways that mimic the presence of water As a result these sugars are capable of preserving the integrity of dry liposomes and membranes Since these effects could conceivably be due to the presence of small amounts of water in the dry preparations of sugar and lipid we have done careful measurements of the residual water contents in the dry samples and report the results here Lyophilized liposomes composed of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylserine 91 contain at most 02 mol of H2O per mol of lipid When the trehalose concentration in the dry mixtures is increased there is no increase in the apparent water content of the samples over a wide range of sugar concentrations Over the same range of trehalose contents the maximal effect of trehalose on physical properties of the lipids and on stabilization of liposomes is achieved We conclude that the stabilization does not require retention of residual amounts of water in the dry trehalosephospholipid preparations Similar studies with other sugars show a relationship between the amount of sugar interacting with the lipid and the ability of the same sugar to stabilize dry liposomes
R140	We studied 50 nonsmoking volunteers ages 1835 yr with no past or present history or physical examination findings of asthma rhinitis allergic disease or recent respiratory infections to evaluate the usefulness of the methacholine bronchoprovocation challenge MBPC as a screening test for asthma All were skintestnegative to 29 aeroallergens and had baseline pulmonary function values greater than 80 predicted Fourteen 28 subjects had a drop in forced expiratory volume in 1 s FEV1 of 20 or greater at a provocative dose PD20FEV1 less than or equal to 225 breath units Moreover when these subjects were compared with 21 asymptomatic allergic asthmatics there was significant overlap between the two groups in concentration of methacholine causing this decline in FEV1 A positive MBPC at methacholine concentrations less than or equal to 5 mgml was not diagnostic of asthma and a negative MBPC at methacholine concentrations greater than or equal to 10 mgml did not rule out asthma These data strongly suggest that MBPC should not be used as the sole factor for the diagnosis of clinically significant asthma A positive MBPC is one indication of the presence of airway hyperresponsiveness and thus is only one of many factors that must be considered in the diagnosis of asthma

R142	We have constructed a set of chimeric Ig by exchanging corresponding H chain C domains between human hu IgG1 and murine m IgE We used this set of Ig to dissect the interaction of individual Ig domains with human Fc gamma receptors Only one of the chimeras epsilonC gamma 23 an mIgE with C epsilon 3 and C epsilon 4 replaced by C gamma 2 and C gamma 3 from huIgG1 binds tightly to the human Fc gamma RI on U937 cells We found that epsilonC gamma 23 has only twofold lower affinity for Fc gamma RI as compared to huIgG1 The gammaC epsilon 4 huIgG1 with C epsilon 4 replacing C gamma 3 binds weakly to Fc gamma RI The other chimeric Ig epsilonC gamma 3 epsilonC gamma 2 and gammaC epsilon 3 as well as mIgE do not bind detectably to Fc gamma RI From these data we conclude that the C gamma 2 domain is crucial for binding and contains the majority of the binding site for Fc gamma RI on IgG1 The C gamma 3 domain makes a smaller contribution to the binding and the C gamma 1 domain and the hinge region have very little effect on the Fc gamma RIIgG1 interaction The chimeric epsilonC gamma 23 and huIgG1 both mediate the formation of rosettes between K562 cells and antigensensitized E with similar concentration dependences These results suggest similar ability to bind to Fc gamma RII The other chimeric Ig do not cause rosettes in this assay system Hence both C gamma 2 and C gamma 3 seem to be required for binding to Fc gamma RII but the C gamma 1hinge region has no detectable effect

R144	Suture line recurrence is an important cause of failure after potentially curative resection for colonic carcinoma Our aim was to determine whether suture technique affected the incidence of perianastomotic tumours in experimentally induced colonic cancer SpragueDawley rats were randomized into three groups A 1 cm longitudinal colotomy was repaired with four interrupted 60 polypropylene monofilament sutures using either a transmural technique n  18 or a seromuscular technique n  18 Control animals n  18 had a sham laparotomy All animals received nine weekly subcutaneous injections of azoxymethane total dose 90 mgkg starting 6 weeks after laparotomy Surviving animals were killed 32 weeks after laparotomy Five animals from each group were given intraperitoneal bromodeoxyuridine 100 mgkg 1 h before being killed At death perianastomotic tumours occurred more frequently in animals with transmural sutures than in either controls or those with seromuscular sutures This difference was associated with a greater mucosal bromodeoxyuridine crypt cell labelling index in the transmural suture group We conclude that a transmural anastomotic suture technique promotes the development of experimental perianastomotic colonic tumours
R145	The rate constant for free fatty acid influx k1 was studied in normal and ischemic myocardium In 15 normal subjects and 30 patients with coronary artery disease 201Tl and 15p123Iiodophenylpentadecanoic acid IPPA were administered during exercise under fasting conditions and at rest In 10 patients the study was repeated after percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty in three patients the study was repeated after infarction The initial accumulation of IPPA related to that of 201Tl both background and crossover corrected was used for determinations of the regional rate constant of IPPA influx into myocardial tissue k1 In normal subjects no significant differences in k1 between major myocardial segments were found the average value of k1 was 057  013min mean  SD at rest and 042  006min at exercise average workload 123  47 W With increasing free fatty acid plasma concentration and perfusion free fatty acid influx increased in a saturable fashion The MichaelisMenten constant KM and the maximal velocity Vmax for IPPA influx into myocardial tissue were estimated to be 470 nmolg and 430 nmolgmin respectively In ischemic areas k1 was reduced to 57  18 of k1 value in nonaffected segments The areas were larger than those showing reduced 201Tl uptake Preinfarction and postinfarction studies showed that the size of 201Tl defects in postinfarction images corresponded with the size of the area with reduced k1 observed in preinfarction scintigrams Revascularization led to an increase of 201Tl uptake and to normalization of k1

R147	Current methods for determining plasma prekallikrein one of three zymogens of the contact phase of plasma proteolysis are laborious and impractical for general use in a clinical laboratory Therefore we have developed a simple reliable assay using commercially available reagents By use of the substrate HDProPheArgpnitroanilideHCI S2302 a functional assay performed in a 96well microplate was designed to measure prekallikrein in plasma Measures were taken to destroy the naturally occurring plasma protease inhibitors of kallikrein without affecting the integrity of the plasma prekallikrein which allowed complete activation of the zymogen to virtually 100 of predicted activity when compared with that of purified kallikrein Besides permitting full activation the use of low pH to destroy critical plasma protease inhibitors allowed the conversion of prekallikrein to kallikrein in as many as 44 plasma samples at one time without the tedious individual timing step usually required to activate each sample An excellent correlation was found r  092 when this functional microassay was compared with a functional spectrophotometric assay performed in three subject populations normal individuals women receiving oral contraceptives who frequently exhibit high plasma prekallikrein concentrations and patients with liver disease who manifest low plasma prekallikrein levels This plasma prekallikrein microassay should facilitate the increased determination of plasma prekallikrein in pathophysiologic conditions as well as the monitoring of the progression of various diseases in which contact activation occurs

R149	The role of human papillomavirus HPV proteins in the pathogenesis of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia CIN and invasive cervical cancer is poorly understood To characterize E4 protein expression in 49 paraffinembedded cervical biopsies representing different histopathologic grades of disease antibodies were elicited to a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids 2034 of a protein predicted to be encoded by the HPV 16 E4 open reading frame The E4 protein was detected throughout the spectrum of CIN from CIN1 to CIN3 Expression was localized to the cell nucleus primarily in the superficial layers of the squamous cervical epithelium Ultrastructural studies showed that the E4 protein was organized into compact intranuclear arrays 2535 nm in diameter E4 protein expression was also demonstrated in some histologically normal tissues containing HPV 16 DNA but not in any of five cervical cancers containing HPV 16 DNA These results suggest that E4 protein expression may precede development of light microscopic tissue abnormalities that it may continue through the spectrum of CIN and that expression of this protein may be reduced or terminated in invasive cancer The function of this protein remains unknown but its nuclear localization may be consistent with a role in viral maturation
R150	To examine the value of clinical measures of ischemia for stratifying prognosis 5886 consecutive patients who had symptomatic significant greater than or equal to 75 stenosis coronary artery disease were studied Using the Cox regression model in a randomly selected half of the patients the prognostically independent clinical variables were weighted and arranged into a simple angina score angina score  angina course X 1  daily angina frequency  STT changes where angina course was equal to 3 if unstable or variant angina was present 2 if the patients angina was progressive with nocturnal episodes 1 if it was progressive without nocturnal symptoms and 0 if it was stable 6 points were added for the presence of ischemic STT changes This angina score was then validated in an independent patient sample The score was a more powerful predictor of prognosis than was any individual anginal descriptor Furthermore the angina score added significant independent prognostic information to the patients age sex coronary anatomy and left ventricular function Patients with three vessel disease and a normal ventricle n  1233 had a 2 year infarctionfree survival rate of 90 with an angina score of 0 and a 68 survival rate with an angina score greater than or equal to 9 With an ejection fraction less than 50 and three vessel disease n  1116 the corresponding infarctionfree survival figures were 76 and 56ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R151	Medullary on and offcell responses to tail heating were studied in lightly anesthetized rats In 10 animals the electromyographic EMG activation of tail muscles was recorded simultaneously with on or offcells The oncell burst or the offcell pause always preceded segmental EMG activation by about 05 sec In turn EMG activation preceded visible tail flick by about 009 sec In 13 other animals ventrobasal thalamic unitary responses were recorded simultaneously with on and offcell responses Oncell bursts or offcell pauses always preceded thalamic responses by about 04 sec These results support the notion that on and offcells play a regulatory role in both segmental and ascending nociceptive transmission
R152	Physiologic concentrations of ATP stimulate the translocation of gallium67 67Ga from human transferrin TF to horse ferritin HoFE The mechanism of this translocation was examined One millimolar ATP did not speed the binding of 67Ga or indium111 111In to HoFE ATP and pyrophosphate PPi at 1 mM did not form high affinity complexes with 67Ga or 111In ATP and PPi interacted directly with the 67GaTF complex and could within minutes increase the amount of nonproteinbound 67Ga Serum HCO3 concentration 30 mM prevented the ATPinduced dissociation of 67Ga from TF whereas intracellular concentrations 04 and 5 mM did not Using a dialysis technique ATP also stimulated the translocation of 111In from TF to HoFE however this process was much slower than with 67Ga ATP caused an increase in the nonproteinbound 111In compared to the control These results suggest the formation of nonproteinbound nuclide by these phosphatecontaining compounds in a kinetically labile form is important to the translocation mechanism

R168	Lipoproteina Lpa has been strongly linked with atherosclerosis and is an independent risk factor for myocardial infarction Distinguishing Lpa from other lowdensity lipoprotein particles is its content of a unique apoprotein apoa The recently described sequence of apoa indicates a remarkable homology with plasminogen the zymogen of the primary thrombolytic enzyme plasmin Lpa may contain 37 or more disulphidelooped kringle structures which are 7585 identical to the fourth kringle of plasminogen Plasminogen receptors are widely distributed on blood cells and are present at extremely high density on endothelial cells These receptors promote thrombolysis by accelerating plasminogen activation and protecting plasmin from inhibition If by molecular mimicry Lpa competes with plasminogen for receptors then thrombolysis would be inhibited and thrombosis promoted Here we provide support for such a mechanism being responsible for the thrombotic risks associated with elevated Lpa by demonstrating that Lpa inhibits plasminogen binding to cells
R169	Evidence for the existence of factors other than blood pressure responsible for modulation of myocardial hypertrophy accompanying hypertension is well documented A factor that has been isolated from the myocardium of the spontaneously hypertensive rat and partially purified has been shown to stimulate protein synthesis in vitro Three indexes of protein synthesis namely incorporation of 3Hleucine into myocyte myosin specific activity of the leucyl tRNA and rate of protein synthesis also were observed to significantly increase on exposure to this factor which may play a key role in the modulation of myocardial hypertrophy that accompanies hypertension Evidence has also been presented demonstrating the role of unknown factors that control the shift of myosin isozymes from V1 a highATPase highcontractile protein type to V3 a slow ATPase type myosin and vice versa This study demonstrates that the modulation of the myocardial mass can be controlled at different levels first at an intrinsic intracellular level by the mechanism of a local growth factor and then at the level of the contractile protein the quality rather than quantity of which was found to be important Both of these were observed to be modulated by factors independent of blood pressure and myocardial mass However it remains to be determined what is responsible at the genetic level for transmitting the signal that selects what type of protein will be synthesized and whether there is a common pathway among all the controlling factors

R173	Evidence for the usefulness of hydroxychloroquine as prophylaxis against thromboembolism after total hip replacement is examined This agent causes reduction in red blood cell aggregation without prolonging the bleeding time in humans and experimentally reduces the size of the thrombus There is a variably demonstrable reduction in platelet aggregation and blood viscosity in humans After hip replacement the venographic incidence of deep vein thrombosis is not influenced by hydroxychloroquine The incidence of fatal pulmonary embolism appears to be reduced but a controlled trial against placebo does not exist There are no serious or irreversible side effects and wound healing is not affected by the administration of this drug Hydroxychloroquine remains the prophylaxis of choice in use at the Hip Center Wrightington Hospital England 13 years after its introduction
R174	OBJECTIVE Because tardive dyskinesia and spontaneous dyskinesia appear the same it is difficult to determine whether an individual patients abnormal movements are induced by medication or have developed spontaneously Therefore estimates of the prevalence of tardive dyskinesia that are based on observations not adjusted for spontaneous dyskinesia are inflated In addition age is thought to be an important risk factor in the development of both tardive and spontaneous dyskinesias The authors estimate the prevalence of both disorders for specific age groups METHOD The authors reviewed nine reports on dyskinesia prevalence that included history of neuroleptic treatment and related prevalence to age A rating of 2 or more on the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale or an equivalent score on another scale was considered an indication of dyskinesia If the subject had taken neuroleptics for more than 3 months the movement disorder was classified as neurolepticassociated dyskinesia other dyskinesias were considered spontaneous The prevalence of tardive dyskinesia was defined as the rate of neurolepticassociated dyskinesia minus the rate of spontaneous dyskinesia RESULTS The true rate of tardive dyskinesia was below 20 for all age groups except 7079 years The correlation between the rate of neurolepticassociated dyskinesia and the rate of spontaneous dyskinesia was low CONCLUSIONS After age 40 the prevalence of spontaneous dyskinesia is sufficiently high to conclude that many patients with diagnoses of tardive dyskinesia have abnormal movements attributable to causes other than neuroleptics

R180	IgGmediated immune reactions are probably involved in the maintenance of gastritis and glandular atrophy the mucosal IgGsubclass pattern may therefore influence the effect of local hypersensitivity mechanisms In this study the proportions of IgG1 IgG2 IgG3 and IgG4producing immunocytes were determined by paired immunofluorescence staining in specimens from simple gastritis gastritis after Billroth II BII resection and gastritis associated with dermatitis herpetiformis DH The results were related to histopathological degree of inflammation and atrophy Generally IgG1 immunocytes predominated 4860 in all types of gastritis With increasing severity of inflammation the IgG2cell proportion was significantly increased from 46 to 2634 in simple and BII gastritis whereas the ratio of IgG1 immunocytes was correspondingly decreased from 5869 to 3843 In the same types of gastritis the proportion of IgG3 cells was increased in association with severe 3538 compared with mild 1523 atrophy whereas the proportion of IgG1 cells was correspondingly decreased In severe gastritis associated with DH the proportion of IgG1 cells was relatively high 60 and that of IgG2 cells relatively low 13 and severe atrophy did not seem to influence significantly the subclass proportions
R181	The development of the thymus and the hypothalamicpituitarygonadal axis are linked by bidirectional hormonally mediated relationships In the present study the direct involvement of the neuropeptide LHRH in the maturation of the thymus and development of the cellmediated and humoral immune responses were assessed after treatment of neonatal from postnatal day 1day 5 female rats with a potent LHRHantagonist LHRHanta pGluDPhe 26Pro3LHRH 50 microgramsrat and the effects compared to those resulting from neonatal castration Whereas in control animals the maturation of mitogenic potential in thymocyte cultures showed a progressive and agedependent increase reaching a maximal activity at 30 days of age and then decreasing after puberty onset in LHRHantatreated rats the thymocytes proliferative response was completely blocked at 7 days of age and remained very low at each time interval studied until 3 months of age A similar effect of the LHRHanta treatment on splenocyte cultures was measured Moreover a reduced percentage of the Thelper lymphocyte subpopulation followed LHRHanta administration By contrast in neonatally castrated rats blastogenic activity was significantly higher compared to control cultures at each stage studied Treatment with LHRHanta produced a significant decrease in thymus wt an alteration of the maturational pattern characterized by a cellular monomorphism reduced thymocyte volume reduction of the cortical area and depauperation of the epithelial microenvironment Moreover a morphometric analysis revealed a selective decrease in the large lymphoid cell population of the subcapsular cortex at 7 and 15 days On the other hand neonatal castration produced an opposite effect leading to a marked hypertrophy of the cortical area and counteracted the postpuberal thymus atrophy When LHRHantatreated adult 3monthold rats were challenged with an antigenic stimulus multiple sc injections of complete Freund adjuvant and BSA and antibody antiBSA antibodies of the immunoglobulin G class production measured in the serum after 15 days a marked and significant decrease in immunoglobulin G levels was observed compared to the values measured in untreated control The described immune deficiencies in LHRHantatreated rats were associated with a clear inhibition of sexual maturation This study clearly indicates that the blockade of central and peripheral LHRH receptors during a critical period for maturation of both hypothalamushypophysealgonadal axis and brainthymuslymphoid axis dramatically impairs immune system development suggesting a potential role of the neuropeptide LHRH in the bidirectional programming of both neuroendocrine and immune functions
R182	In rats with unilateral 6hydroxydopamine substantia nigra lesions the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on LDOPAinduced rotation and regional cerebral glucose utilization RCGU changes were examined Contralateral rotation induced by LDOPA 25 mgkg was effectively blocked by D1 SCH 23390 10 mgkg and D2 eticlopride 20 mgkg antagonists in combination but not by either antagonist alone This suggests that in the dopaminedepleted rat LDOPA administration results in the stimulation of both D1 and D2 receptor systems each capable of independently eliciting a full motor response LDOPA altered RCGU in the following brain regions ipsilateral to the lesion entopeduncular nucleus EP  105 substantia nigra pars reticulata SNr  121 subthalamic nucleus STN  32 deep layers of the superior colliculus DLSC  35 and lateral habenula nucleus LHN 52 The effects in the EP and SNr were blocked completely by D1 antagonist pretreatment but only partially attenuated by D2 antagonist pretreatment indicating the critical dependence of these changes on D1 stimulation In contrast combined D1 and D2 antagonist pretreatment but neither drug alone blocked the LDOPAinduced increases in the STN and DLSC The effects of LDOPA in the LHN were attenuated by either SCH 23390 or eticlopride and blocked completely by the antagonist combination These results provide evidence that dopamine formed following the decarboxylation of LDOPA stimulates both D1 and D2 receptors in vivo and that stimulation of each receptor contributes uniquely to its physiological effects Neural mechanisms of action of LDOPA are discussed in the context of these findings
R183	To determine whether tactile sensitivity of the normal skin is altered by suppression of sympathetic efferent activity the effect of stellate ganglion block and epidural sympathetic block on touch threshold was studied The study was performed on ten individuals with various chronic pain syndromes Tactile sensitivity was measured in the normal skin area with the use of von Frey filaments and a twoalternative forcedchoice procedure with a staircase presentation of touch stimuli With stellate ganglion block touch threshold decreased on the side of the block by 488  8 P  0002 without any significant change in the threshold on the healthy nonblocked side P  0003 for the difference between the sides With epidural sympathetic block touch threshold decreased to the same extent on the diseased and healthy sides which were both affected by the block 462  114 P  0027 and 477  125 P  0032 respectively The results show that sympathetic blockade increases tactile sensitivity They also suggest that sympathetic efferent activity modulates the function of tactile receptors It is hypothesized that the sympathetic modulation makes tactile receptors less sensitive to touch less specific and probably more prone to code tactile stimuli in such a way that the brain recognizes this code as pain
R184	The case reports describe three elderly amputees with coexisting severe COPD All three successfully mastered their prostheses and were discharged home able to walk functional distances This demonstrates that these patients deserve a trial period of rehabilitation in a situation where close medical supervision and optimal medical management are available Two of our cases died within 5 years indicating the fragility and poor longterm prognosis of these patients the third was lost to followup
R185	This article presents information garnered after an investigation by the Environmental Protection Agency in 1987 of dentists and others who had sold scrap dental amalgam to refiners who had arranged for the disposal or treatment  of hazardous substances and were responsible for adverse consequences associated with their subsequent management and refining Information about the health hazard status of scrap dental amalgams was obtained by interviews with toxicologists review of published lists of toxic and hazardous materials and survey of biomedical publications 1977 through 1987 concerning toxicity or health hazards associated with dental amalgams The conclusions were that scrap dental amalgam is not a waste substance to be disposed of but is a product of commercial value identified or regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency the Occupational Safety and Health Administration the Department of Transportation the Food and Drug Administration the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health the US Public Health Service or the Centers for Disease Control as an environmental health hazard or toxic substance identified by toxicologists and persons responsible for solid waste regulation as a toxic substance or environmental health hazard nor proved by scientific study to be toxic or hazardous in the manner and form in which it is collected and stored by dentists and subsequently sold to metal refiners
R186	This study examines the recently reported gender differences in cardiac responses to exercise The study group consisted of 192 men and 67 women with a low probability of coronary artery disease who underwent supine exercise radionuclide angiography Men had a lower rest ejection fraction than that of women 063 versus 066 p  002 and greater increases in ejection fraction with exercise 008 versus 002 p  00001 The slope relating ejection fraction to metabolic equivalents of exercise METs was greater p  0004 for men even after adjustment for differences in rest ejection fraction and enddiastolic volume index Compared with men women had a smaller rest enddiastolic volume index 87 versus 97 mlm2 p  0003 and a greater increase in enddiastolic volume index with exercise 6 versus 2 mlm2 p  0002 The slope relating enddiastolic volume to METs was greater for women even after adjustment for differences in rest enddiastolic volume index and peak work load There are clear gender differences in the supine exercise response of ejection fraction and enddiastolic volume that are not explained by differences in exercise capacity
R187	Three patients with rhinoscleroma who presented with nasal and pharyngeal symptoms are described Treatment with ceforanide a new secondgeneration cephalosporin with high intrinsic activity against Klebsiella and possessing a long halflife was used as outpatient treatment A total of 120 g of ceforanide was administered over a period of two months All three patients showed signs of clinical improvement but only two of three became bacteriologically sterile at the end of two months one patient relapsed bacteriologically but not clinically once the drug was discontinued Second and thirdgeneration cephalosporins appear to have excellent activity against the causative pathogens of rhinoscleroma Because of the impracticality of administering these agents parenterally over prolonged periods of time there is a need for the development of an oral cephalosporin with similar intrinsic activity and betalactamase stability Perhaps the novel betalactam antibiotics such as the penems and monobactams some of which can be administered orally will answer that need
R188	Family history data from an incident casecontrol study of lung cancer conducted in the Texas Gulf Coast region between 1976 and 1980 were analyzed to evaluate the contribution of cancer in firstdegree relatives to lung cancer risk Odds ratios OR increased slightly as the number of relatives with any cancer increased reaching 15 with 4 or more relatives with cancer Risks were higher for tobaccorelated cancers OR  15 for 2 or more relatives with these tumors and greatest for firstdegree relatives with lung cancer OR  28 for lung cancer in 2 or more relatives For cases of squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma of the lung risks with 3 or more relatives with any cancer were increased 2fold OR  18 and 19 respectively and a significantly elevated risk was found for having a firstdegree relative with lung cancer for each histologic type ORs from 1721 Having a spouse with lung cancer increased lung cancer risk OR  25 and cases with lung cancer reported in a firstdegree relative were diagnosed at an earlier age as were case siblings with lung cancer
R189	A mammalian periosteal cell culture system was developed to investigate the metabolic response of fresh calf bone periosteal cells to various oxygen tensions in vitro Two predominant cell phenotypes were seen in the culture system A rapidly proliferating mat of alkaline phosphatasenegative cells supported the growth of overlying clusters of alkaline phosphatasepositive cells The appearance and subsequent population growth of the alkaline phosphatasepositive cells correlated directly with increases in enzyme activity on biochemical assay Alkaline phosphatase production was optimal at lower oxygen tensions 5 9 which approximated capillary pO2 In addition the preconfluence oxygen environment was more critical to the final expression of the enzyme activity than the postconfluence environment The mechanism of the environmental regulation of alkaline phosphatase gene expression at various oxygen tensions is not known Periosteal cells were highly sensitive to oxygen tension and expressed alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity at oxygen levels approximating capillary rather than atmospheric pO2
R190	The effects of calcitonin generelated peptide CGRP on lumen diameter and adenylate cyclase activity in isolated intracerebral arterioles were examined CGRP produced a concentrationdependent relaxation of spontaneous tone developed by the arterioles with an EC50 value of 39 x 109 M Calcitonin as well as substance P which is frequently colocalized with CGRP had no effect on arteriolar tone CGRP also relaxed arterioles contracted with the thromboxane mimetic U44619 yielding an EC50 value of 3 x 109 M The CGRP fragment human CGRP837 antagonized CGRPinduced relaxation in a noncompetitive manner Adenylate cyclase activity in single arterioles was stimulated by CGRP but not by substance P in a concentrationdependent fashion Half maximal stimulation occurred at 8 x 109 M whereas maximum stimulation 25fold over basal occurred at 107 M CGRP837 inhibited CGRPstimulated adenylate cyclase activity over a concentration range of 109 to 105 M The results demonstrate that CGRP stimulates adenylate cyclase activity and is a potent vasodilator of small parenchymal cerebral arterioles in vitro and may play an important role in the regulation of cerebral blood flow
R191	Heymann nephritis model of membranous glomerulonephropathy MGN kidneys n  20 with proteinuria were transplanted into unilaterally nephrectomized normal syngeneic Lewis recipient rats to study the course of established MGN lesion in normal milieu Concurrent with the loss of C3 staining from the MGN lesion at 2 to 4 wk after transplantation the proteinuria decreased from the transplanted kidney p less than 002 Thereafter from 2 to 28 wk no further decrease was noted in proteinuria which stabilized at a lower but still abnormal level No appreciable decrease in IgG deposits in MGN lesion was noted up to 12 wk but at 28 wk the deposits had decreased significantly p less than 0005 However the deposits did not resolve completely even at 40 wk The results indicate that in MGN one component of proteinuria is due to ongoing activation of C with the deposition of new antibody and the other is perhaps due to structural damage to glomerular filter The former appears reversible and the later irreversible Although the resolution of IgG deposits in the lesion is very slow significant improvement can occur with time several months
R192	Many advances have occurred in breast cancer through research and clinical trials More confidence in new biological consumptions about invasive breast cancer indicate that 1 details of the primary breast cancer do not control survival 2 breastonly failures after local excision do not bias against survival and 3 cancer cell dissemination occurs at the same time via both lymphatic and hematogenous routes Early detection with mammographic screening has indicated a greater number of smaller breast cancers including sharp increases in ductal carcinoma in situ DCIS With proper analysis and control DCIS of limited extent can be treated by local excision with or without radiation Invasive breast cancer of limited extent can frequently be managed by lumpectomy and radiation therapy with survival rates equivalent to the more traditional mastectomy Patient desires regarding breast preservation and quality of life are paramount Risk benefit analyses for individual patients need to be emphasized in issues of breast preservation and in selecting adjuvant therapy both regional radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy and hormonal therapy We are entering an era of highly selective therapy based on more sophisticated analysis of the primary cancer In the future not only statistical predictions of outcome as achieved by flow cytometry for example will be more widely used but individual prognostic factors may be developed such as with oncogene expression Such individual prognostic factors will enable more selective therapy
R193	By cloning T cells mutations at the hypoxanthineguanine phosphoribosyltransferase locus were quantified in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 12 patients with connective tissue diseases receiving longterm cyclophosphamide Frequency of mutation was higher than in control subjects and was related to the duration of therapy therefore some cells with mutations are longlived and these cells accumulate in the peripheral circulation Mutation frequency was also independently related to age The results indicate that even low doses of cyclophosphamide are mutagenic and may explain in part why these patients are at risk of druginduced malignancy
R194	Vitamin D3 receptors are intracellular proteins that mediate the nuclear action of the active metabolite 125dihydroxyvitamin D3 125OH2D3 Two receptorspecific monoclonal antibodies were used to recover the complementary DNA cDNA of this regulatory protein from a chicken intestinal lambda gt11 cDNA expression library The amino acid sequences that were deduced from this cDNA revealed a highly conserved cysteinerich region that displayed homology with a domain characteristic of other steroid receptors and with the gagerbA oncogene product of avian erythroblastosis virus RNA selected via hybridization with this DNA sequence directed the cellfree synthesis of immunoprecipitable vitamin D3 receptor Northern blot analysis of polyadenylated RNA with these cDNA probes revealed two vitamin D receptor messenger RNAs mRNAs of 26 and 32 kilobases in receptorcontaining chicken tissues and a major crosshybridizing receptor mRNA species of 42 kilobases in mouse 3T6 fibroblasts The 42kilobase species was substantially increased by prior exposure of 3T6 cells to 125OH2D3 This cDNA represents perhaps the rarest mRNA cloned to date in eukaryotes as well as the first receptor sequence described for an authentic vitamin
R195	A mixture of signs and symptoms can occur with muscarinic poisoning from medications or mushrooms Manifestations may vary even among persons who ingested mushrooms grown in the same patch and gathered at the same time Confusion can occur if mushroom poisoning is attributed to a suspected species rather than to the toxin suggested by signs and symptoms Accurate diagnosis depends on clinical suspicion and recognition of muscarinic manifestations notably diaphoresis salivation bladder cramping diarrhea and difficulty with visual accommodation Muscarinic toxicity due to medications necessitates an adjustment in drug dosage In mushroom poisoning that produces primarily muscarinic effects atropine is the treatment of choice
R196	The authors describe a rapidly growing soft tissue tumor of predominantly histiocytic composition in an 8yearold child The tumor cells were identified as elements of the mononuclear phagocyte system by histologic histochemical immunologic and electron microscopic study Despite the presence of a minor fibroblastic component the tumor did not conform to established criteria for a diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma Formation of frequent desmosomelike intercellular junctions raised the possibility of dendritic reticulum cell differentiation since the latter cells seem to be the only elements of the mononuclear phagocyte system that display such specialized cell junctions The results of immunostaining were discrepant with those reported for normal dendritic reticulum cells but the currently available information makes it doubtful that the entire neoplastic spectrum of dendritic cell differentiation can currently be diagnosed in surgical pathology
R197	Inhaled adenosine and adenosine 5monophosphate AMP cause bronchoconstriction in atopic and nonatopic asthmatics by a mechanism believed to involve histamine release from airway mast cells and an interaction with neural reflexes In the present study we have investigated the effect of oral terfenadine 180 mg flurbiprofen 100 mg and the drug combination on AMPinduced bronchoconstriction in eight nonatopic asthmatic subjects with a mean age of 538  56 yr The provocation concentrations of histamine and AMP required to produce a 20 decrease in FEV1 PC20 were determined to be 25 range 02 to 163 and 501 range 15 to 841 mgml respectively representing a potency difference of 178fold on a molar basis In subsequent timecourse studies the bronchoconstrictor response to inhalation of the PC20 histamine was suppressed completely by terfenadine and the drug combination but unaffected by flurbiprofen Terfenadine alone and flurbiprofen alone inhibited bronchoconstriction provoked by the PC20 AMP by 498  55 p less than 001 and 319  79 p less than 001 respectively when areas under the FEV1 time curves were compared with placebo the difference between the two treatments not being significant p  006 The drug combination inhibited the response to AMP by 600  83 p less than 001 this being significantly greater than with flurbiprofen p less than 001 but not with terfenadine alone These data implicate both histamine and cyclooxygenase products in the bronchoconstrictor response to AMP
R198	The environmental contaminant 2378tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin TCDD and the corticosteroid dexamethasone have potent effects on lymphocyte function although the effects of the former have not been well characterized In the present studies murine B cell maturation was used as a model system to examine and compare the effects of TCDD and dexamethasone on cell function Immunosuppression by TCDD and dexamethasone is mediated by binding to specific intracellular R referred to as the Ah and glucocorticoid R respectively Although both compounds were comparable in their ability to inhibit antibody responses to the Tindependent antigen TNPLPS the events responsible for suppression were found to be distinct Dexamethasone although affecting multiple stages of B cell maturation had its primary effect very early manifested by inhibition of the phosphoinositide signal transduction pathway This was evidenced by a decrease in accumulation of inositol phosphate and surface Ia antigen expression as well as an inability to enter the cell cycle after stimulation with antiIg In contrast neither early signaling events nor proliferation were affected in B cells treated with TCDD However TCDD inhibited Ig secretion after stimulation of B cells with T cellreplacing factor suggesting that TCDD modulates the differentiation of B cells into plasma cells These differential results were confirmed by monitoring the expression of surface antigens that occur on B cells including Ia 7D4 and PC2 during this maturational process Whereas dexamethasone inhibited the expression of surface antigens that occur early in maturation Ia and 7D4 TCDD blocked only the expression of the plasma cell marker PC2 Although TCDD altered later stages of the B cell cycle the presence of TCDD was required at the time of initial activation to be effective suggesting that TCDD may interfere with early cell programming

R200	Amoxapine is a secondgeneration antidepressant that has been reported to cause seizures severe acidosis cardiac dysrhythmias hypotension renal failure coma and cardiorespiratory arrest in poisoning exposures This is a report of a previously normal 9yearold child who presented with generalized tonic clonic seizures that led to an extensive workup for primary generalized epilepsy Nothing in the patients history or laboratory test results suggested ingestion of a toxin It was not until 48 hours after admission when the child admitted taking several of her mothers amoxapine tablets that the correct diagnosis was made Because of the risks and the diagnostic pitfalls associated with ingestion of amoxapine clinicians should be mindful of the lessons taught by this case
R201	Six beagles were examined for timerelated changes of bronchial responsiveness to methacholine plasma histamine and thromboxane B2 and biopsy of bronchial tissues after intratracheal injection of Bordetella bronchiseptica A progressive increase in bronchial responsiveness was induced after injection The mediators however did not elevate and tissue neutrophil counts did not correlate with increased airway hyperresponsiveness Intratracheal injection of heatkilled Bordetella bronchiseptica produced no alteration in these parameters Thus it is speculated that airway epithelial damage and effects on ciliostatic function induced by the organism are primarily involved in the pathogenesis
R202	Although gunshot is by far the most common means of homicide in the United States significant numbers of homicides are also perpetrated by other means Bluntforce injuries are produced by a variety of objects including hands and feet and many different weapons Some of these objects produce distinctive patterns of injury of potential evidentiary value This paper presents a series of 20 consecutive bluntforce homicides in adults Seventy percent 14 cases of the victims were men Thirty percent six cases followed an argument or altercation A number of the weapons used were weapons of opportunity seized in the course of the incidents Sixtynine percent nine cases of known assailants were acquainted with their victims Few characteristic patterned injuries were seen Not surprisingly craniocerebral trauma was the most common cause of death One half 10 cases the victims survived their assaults for varying periods of time Homicides due to bluntforce injury still pose a significant challenge for the forensic pathologist who must obtain a complete and accurate history of the fatal incident interpret patterns of injury and other findings at autopsy and correlate all of the findings to make an accurate ruling of the cause and manner of death
R203	Twenty patients with severe plaque psoriasis were selected to receive either lowdose cyclosporin A CyA or placebo CyA vehicle in a doubleblind randomized trial at two centres Within 4 weeks the mean reduction in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index PASI in 10 patients receiving CyA mean dose 55 mgkgday differed significantly from the mean reduction in 10 patients receiving placebo In eight patients given placebo a switch to CyA therapy resulted within 4 weeks in a mean reduction in PASI of 90 In a total 15 out of 18 patients given CyA 83 mean dose 56 mgkgday there was an improvement of greater than or equal to 75 in PASI within 4 weeks In a 2month tapering off phase a lower mean CyA dose 3 mgkgday was effective in maintaining the reduced PASI scores in seven of nine patients Four out of five CyA treated patients who entered a posttreatment observation phase had a relapse PASI score greater than or equal to 50 of score at baseline after a mean interval of 65 weeks The most important sideeffects were mild reversible hypertension in 5 of 18 patients 28 and reversible elevated serum creatinine levels in 7 of 18 patients 39 We consider that further studies are justified in severe chronic psoriasis to establish suitable regimens for maintenance of remission in psoriasis with lowdoses of CyA or a combination of CyA with other antipsoriatic agents
R204	Our purpose was to compare the analgesic efficacy and safety of single oral doses of the combination of ibuprofen 400 mg plus codeine 60 mg and the combination of ibuprofen 200 mg plus codeine 30 mg with ibuprofen 400 mg alone codeine sulfate 60 mg alone and placebo One hundred ninetyfive patients with severe pain resulting from episiotomy cesarean section or gynecologic surgery completed a randomized doubleblind stratified parallelgroup study Patients were observed during a 4hour period after medication Based on the sum of the pain intensity differences SPID total pain relief TOTPAR and most of the hourly direct measures of pain and relief both doses of the combination and ibuprofen 400 mg alone were statistically superior to placebo Codeine 60 mg was statistically superior to placebo based on TOTPAR the global ratings and a few hourly measures The mean effect of the combination of ibuprofen 400 mg plus codeine 60 mg was significantly superior to the mean effect of ibuprofen 400 mg alone 12 1 and 2 hours after medication and to the mean effect of ibuprofen 400 mg alone and codeine 60 mg alone for SPID TOTPAR and other measures as well The lowdose combination was significantly more effective than codeine 60 mg for a few hourly measures but was not significantly superior to ibuprofen 400 mg Based on these findings it appears that the combination of ibuprofen 400 mg plus codeine 60 mg particularly in the first few hours after medication is more efficacious than its constituents
R205	CV 205502 an octahydrobenzogquinoline is a dopamine agonist compound that is not an ergot or ergoline derivative To investigate the site of action of CV 205502 three groups of five men were given single daily doses of CV 205502 004 006 or 008 mgday doses that suppress plasma PRL by 6080 for 24 h for 5 days on day 6 a combined anterior pituitary function test using iv administration of four hypothalamic releasing hormones TRH 200 micrograms GHRH 100 micrograms CRH 100 micrograms LHRH 100 micrograms was performed One month later the challenge tests were repeated to obtain control values The following hormones were measured by RIA in plasma TSH ACTH cortisol PRL GH LH FSH and testosterone With the exception of plasma PRL levels basal and releasing hormonestimulated values were similar after CV 205502 administration and after the 1month washout period Basal plasma PRL was lower after CV 205502 administration and the response to TRH was attenuated by all three doses of CV 205502 the mean percent inhibition values were 76 93 and 94 respectively All three doses of CV 205502 were well tolerated and another group of men well tolerated 01 mg daily The results confirm that CV 205502 is a potent dopamine agonist which directly inhibits lactotropic cells but has no effect on other pituitary cell types
R206	Indium111hydroxyquinoline labelled platelets though useful in the detection of thrombus have not gained widespread use owing to the time and technical skill required for their preparation A study was therefore conducted evaluating a new method of imaging thrombus with platelets radiolabelled with a 111In labelled monoclonal antibody P256 directed to the platelet surface glycoprotein complex IIbIIIa When the number of receptors occupied by P256 was less than 3 of the total available on the platelet surface platelet function as assessed by platelet aggregometry was undisturbed P256 was radiolabelled with 111In using diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid which achieved a specific activity of 185 MBq 5 mCimg No impairment of immunoreactivity was detected at this specific activity Platelets were labelled with radiolabelled monoclonal antibody in vitro in two patients at a receptor occupancy of 6 and in vivothat is by direct intravenous injection of P256in six patients at a receptor occupancy of 1 In vivo recovery and biodistribution kinetics suggested that after in vitro labelling platelets were minimally activated The 111In kinetics recorded after intravenous P256 suggested rapid and efficient radiolabelling of platelets and gave no indication of platelet activation Of the six patients who received intravenous P256 three had documented thrombus two of whom gave positive results on P256 platelet scintigraphy The third subject had chronic deep venous thrombosis and was scintigraphically negative Imaging thrombus using a radiolabelled monoclonal antibody directed to platelets appears to offer great potential as a simple noninvasive approach to the diagnosis of thrombosis
R207	The authors prospectively treated 10 consecutive patients with multiloculated empyemas with intracavitary instillation of urokinase via a percutaneous drainage catheter Urokinase 100000 IU in 100 mL of 5 dextrose in water was instilled into the pleural cavity via a percutaneous drainage catheter After overnight clamping the catheter was opened and the empyema drained with use of negative suction 20 cm H2O Intermittent irrigation of the catheter with normal saline was performed to prevent clogging of the catheter Complete drainage of multiloculated empyemas was accomplished in nine patients by means of intracavitary instillation of urokinase via a single 8F catheter One patient showed complete drainage of multiloculated empyema but recurrent empyema appeared in the site of a previous tube thoracostomy A total of 100000700000 IU mean 400000 IU of urokinase were needed for complete drainage in all patients Plasminogen and fibrin degradation product levels in empyema fluid were determined before instillation of urokinase to demonstrate any fibrinolytic action No complications occurred
R208	This paper presents two cases of adenosquamous carcinoma of the colon and brings to 39 the total number documented in medical literature The concurrent glandular and squamous differentiation of the tumor cells was demonstrated by immunocytochemistry and electron microscopy Evaluation of the biologic characteristics of all the reported cases suggests that malignant squamous elements in colonic carcinomas behave more aggressively than their glandular counterparts In contradistinction from the pure squamouscell carcinoma of the colon adenosquamous carcinoma does not show the same predilection for the right colon
R209	Human osteoblast cultures hOB were examined for the production of interstitial collagenase tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases TIMP and gelatinolytic enzymes Cells were isolated by bacterial collagenase digestion of trabecular bone vertebra rib tibia and femur from 11 subjects neonatal to adult Confluent cultures were exposed to phorbol 12myristate 13acetate PTH PGE2 epidermal growth factor 125OH2 vitamin D3 recombinant human IL1 beta and dexamethasone Collagenase and TIMP were assayed immunologically and also by measurements of functional activity Collagenase was not secreted in significant quantities by human bone cells under any tested condition Furthermore collagenase mRNA could not be detected in hOB However hOB spontaneously secreted large amounts of TIMP for at least 72 h in culture hOB TIMP was found to be identical to human fibroblast TIMP by double immunodiffusion metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation Northern blot analysis and stoichiometry of collagenase inhibition SDSsubstrate gel electrophoresis of hOBconditioned media revealed a prominent band of gelatinolytic activity at 68 kD and specific polyclonal antisera established its identity with the major gelatinolytic protease of human fibroblasts Abundant secretion of gelatinolytic but not collagenolytic enzymes by hOB may indicate that human osteoblasts do not initiate and direct the cleavage of osteoid collagen on the bone surface but may participate in the preparation of the bone surface for osteoclast attachment by removal of denatured collagen peptides The constitutive secretion of TIMP may function to regulate metalloproteinase activity

R212	The need to preserve hearing during acoustic neuroma removal has rekindled interest in labyrinthsparing procedures This review of 11 years experience with the retrosigmoid approach to acoustic neuroma removal includes 335 procedures in 332 patients There were no intraoperative deaths two patients died in the postoperative period The facial nerve was preserved in 863 of procedures and auditory function was preserved in 45 procedures 34 of those tumors were 2 cm or smaller Postoperative complications occurred in 101 procedures the most common being cerebrospinal fluid otorhinorrhea in 40 cases 25 of these required secondary surgery Meningitis occurred 16 times and aspiration 8 times all other complications were less frequent Tumor removal was incomplete in eight procedures in only one of these cases has tumor recurred The six recurrences usually were identified 5 or more years postoperatively This has prompted us to follow patients for 7 years postoperatively Major changes in our management include the use of the supine position and of electrophysiologic monitoring Advantages of the approach are 1 wide access to the tumor 2 applicability to all tumor sizes 3 potential to preserve facial and auditory function in all cases and 4 ability to change procedure without sacrificing labyrinth This review confirms our confidence in this approach to acoustic neuroma removal
R213	The prevalence and course of sexual dysfunction was evaluated in 221 alcoholic cirrhotic men participating in a doubleblind placebocontrolled study on the effect of oral testosterone treatment on liver disease At entry 67 95 confidence limits 6174 complained of sexual dysfunction Sexual dysfunction was significantly p less than 005 associated with lower serum concentrations of testosterone nonproteinbound testosterone and nonsex hormonebinding globulinbound testosterone The significant associations between sexual dysfunction and nonproteinbound and nonsex hormonebinding globulinbound testosterone concentrations disappeared however when age ethanol consumption and severity of liver disease were included as covariates in the analysis During followup median 30 mo range 148 mo sexual dysfunction improved significantly p less than 005 at 6 12 and 24 mo Furthermore the reported libido and erectile and ejaculatory function improved significantly at the end of the followup period p less than 001 However the testosteronetreated patients did not differ significantly from the placebotreated patients regarding any of the changes in sexual function In conclusion oral testosterone treatment does not significantly influence the type or course of sexual dysfunction in alcoholic cirrhotic men However sexual function improved after reduction of ethanol consumption in these patients
R214	To establish an early reliable diagnostic test for herpes simplex virus HSV type 1 encephalitis HSVE we used isoelectric focusing IEF and an IEFoverlay technique with radiolabeled HSV glycoprotein B gB to study 7 serum and 12 cerebrospinal fluid CSF samples from 12 patients with presumed or biopsyproved HSVE Bloodbrain barrier damage and increased intrabloodbrain barrier IgG synthesis were detected in 5 of the 7 patients with HSVE CSF oligoclonal bands were found in 6 of 11 patients Using an IEFoverlay technique we detected antigB antibody in all serum 7 of 7 and in 10 of 12 CSF samples AntigB antibody was found in 4 of 6 CSF specimens obtained within the first week of disease days 3 to 5 and in all samples collected later in the disease The pH range of antigB antibody activity was broad 45 to 95 indicating a heterogeneous immune response to HSV A hematogenous origin of the CSF antibody was suggested because antigB antibody appeared in serum before matched CSF and because both serum and matched CSF had a similar antibody IEF pattern Local production of antigB antibody was suggested in some cases because of a greater prominence of antigB antibody in CSF than in matched sera and because CSF oligoclonal bands had antigB antibody activity In contrast only one of 6 CSF samples from patients with multiple sclerosis had gB antibody activity in this case antigB antibody activity did not correspond in isoelectric point location to oligoclonal bandsABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R215	Colorectal carcinoma is the second leading cause of cancer death in the US The risk for colon carcinoma increases after the age of 40 years Because there is a very significant familial incidence of colorectal carcinoma this is a major group of individuals who should be screened The vast majority of colorectal carcinomas are associated with adenomatous polyps of the large intestine Colonoscopy is the best procedure available to evaluate those at risk the doublecontrast barium enema and flexible sigmoidoscopy also play a significant role in diagnosis Screening for occult blood in the stool is presently the best tool to evaluate groups for potential colorectal lesions Although there are still significant problems with occult blood testing it can account for a definite decrease in morbidity and mortality from colorectal carcinoma
R216	Ninetyfour squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity treated on the authors service between 1969 and 1981 were evaluated The series included squamous cell carcinomas of various intraoral sites excluding the lips and hard palate Survival of 60 mo was 70 for stage I 65 for stage II 45 for stage III and 27 for stage IV carcinoma Twentyfour of 34 patients with early cancer stages I and II were treated by operation alone Too few patients with early cancer were treated by combined irradiation and surgery to draw conclusions regarding relative efficacy of combination therapy Sixty patients had advanced cancer stages III and IV Fiveyear survival was 37 for patients treated by operation alone 18 after salvage surgery after failed irradiation and 60 for patients treated by operation combined with planned perioperative irradiation Combination therapy appeared to improve control of locoregional disease as well as survival in patients with advanced cancer
R217	Infarct expansion is acute regional dilatation and thinning of the infarct zone There are several possibilities for the mechanism of this alteration in cardiac shape thinning could be caused by 1 cell rupture 2 a reduction in the intercellular space or 3 stretching of myocytes or 4 slippage of groups of myocytes so that less cells are distributed across the wall To determine the relative contributions of these cellular mechanisms of wall thinning and dilatation detailed study of transverse histological sections of rat hearts with infarct expansion was performed 1 2 and 3 days after coronary ligation The number of cells across the wall was determined in six regions within adjacent to and remote from the infarct Cell counting was performed so that the total number of cells across the wall and the number of cells per unit length cell density across the wall were determined The transmural cell count and the cell density were correlated with the wall thickness in each region Myocyte crosssectional areas and sarcomere lengths were also measured The results from the infarct expansion hearts were compared with those of shamoperated control hearts that had been similarly analyzed To ensure that mechanisms identified in the rat were applicable to human infarct expansion five hearts from patients who died within 3 days of infarction and two hearts from patients without coronary disease were studied histologically in a similar fashion Wall thinning occurred in all regions of the rat infarct expansion hearts compared with controls p less than 00001 but as expected was most pronounced in the infarct zone A decrease in the number of cells across the wall accompanied the wall thinning at each site p less than 00001 and this change in cell number was highly correlated with the changes in wall thickness r  0915 p less than 0001 Cell density increased from controls only within the infarct zone p less than 0001 and accounted for at most 20 of the thinning in that region The change in cell density was attributable to both cell stretch measured by increased sarcomere length and decreased myocyte crosssectional area and a decrease in the intercellular space A similar strong correlation between wall thinning and decreased number of cells across the wall was identified in the human hearts r  094 p less than 0001ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R218	We have evaluated three methods of assessing patients with cyclical breast symptoms cyclical mastopathyCM One method a screening questionnaire was used to identify women with CM and two others a symptom severity questionnaire and a daily diary were used prospectively to record the severity of symptoms in relation to the menstrual cycle The screening questionnaire was assessed for testretest reliability and for agreement between the recalled severity of symptoms and those recorded during prospective measurement The symptom severity questionnaire and diary were assessed by examining their ability to discriminate between pre and postmenstrual phases of the menstrual cycle differences in symptom severity at these times being the cardinal feature of CM Testretest reliability of premenstrual symptoms by the screening questionnaire gave correlation coefficients over 070 for 9 of the 11 items assessed The symptom severity questionnaire showed significant differences between pre and postmenstrual scores for 8 of the 11 items assessed and the diary for each of the 2 items assessed Comparison of symptom severity as recalled and as prospectively recorded showed only modest agreement These results show that the instruments used to assess symptom severity performed satisfactorily but that the screening questionnaire used to identify women with CM although reliable correlated only moderately well with prospective measurement
R219	A method is presented for protein secondary structure prediction based on a neural network A training phase was used to teach the network to recognize the relation between secondary structure and amino acid sequences on a sample set of 48 proteins of known structure On a separate test set of 14 proteins of known structure the method achieved a maximum overall predictive accuracy of 63 for three states helix sheet and coil A numerical measure of helix and sheet tendency for each residue was obtained from the calculations When predictions were filtered to include only the strongest 31 of predictions the predictive accuracy rose to 79
R220	We report the cloning and characterization of a cDNA encoding a second human cyclosporin Abinding protein hCyPB Homology analyses reveal that hCyPB is a member of the cyclophilin B CyPB family which includes yeast CyPB Drosophila nina A and rat cyclophilinlike protein This family is distinguished from the cyclophilin A CyPA family by the presence of endoplasmic reticulum ERdirected signal sequences hCyPB has a hydrophobic leader sequence not found in hCyPA and its first 25 amino acids are removed upon expression in Escherichia coli Moreover we show that hCyPB is a peptidylprolyl cistrans isomerase which can be inhibited by cyclosporin A These observations suggest that other members of the CyPB family will have similar enzymatic properties Sequence comparisons of the CyPB proteins show a central 165amino acid peptidylprolyl isomerase and cyclosporin Abinding domain flanked by variable Nterminal and Cterminal domains These two variable regions may impart compartmental specificity and regulation to this family of cyclophilin proteins containing the conserved core domain Northern blot analyses show that hCyPB mRNA is expressed in the Jurkat Tcell line consistent with its possible target role in cyclosporin Amediated immunosuppression

R222	We present the clinical and biopsy findings of a 63yrold white male with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis and a long history of extensive exposure to mica while working in the rubber industry The patient presented 30 yr after the initial exposure with complaints of progressive shortness of breath and a chronic nonproductive cough Pulmonary function testing revealed restrictive lung function with a mild reduction in the total lung capacity 80 of predicted and a moderatetosevere reduction in the diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide 50 of predicted The chest radiogram and highresolution chest CT scan showed diffuse fibrosis and focal honeycombing involving the upper and lower lung zones bilaterally Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed 20 neutrophils in the lavage fluid with abundant rectangular flaking crystals Openlung biopsy exhibited extensive fibrosis and architectural remodeling with abundant sheets and fragments of engulfed polarizable crystalline material Energydispersive spectroscopy and electron diffraction studies confirmed the material to have the features of mica Asbestos and other silicates were not identified The documentation of prolonged exposure to mica the clinical and radiographic features of severe interstitial fibrosis and the histopathologic delineation of the interstitial lesion including spectroscopic and crystallographic verification of crystalline mica support the causal relationship between mica and interstitial fibrosis
R223	Multiple drug therapy including nitrates beta blockers calcium antagonists aspirin and heparin has been advocated as effective in the treatment of unstable angina a syndrome with a multifactorial pathogenesis Recently plaque rupture and thrombosis have been demonstrated as the most important pathogenetic mechanisms Nevertheless clearcut results on the effects of thrombolytic treatment in unstable angina are still lacking Some possible explanations why the medical treatment of unstable angina has still not yet been standardized whereas that of myocardial infarction has are suggested A review of randomized and nonrandomized studies published on this topic evaluating the role of different thrombolytic agents in unstable angina is presented In addition the role of coronary angiography is discussed In view of the disappointing results of coronary artery bypass surgery performed in the acute phase of the disease one of the goals of clinical research is to identify subsets of patients at high and low risk and who undergo different types of therapeutic interventions To support published data suggesting that total myocardial ischemia has a significant impact on prognosis we present our results of a study carried out on patients with refractory unstable angina treated with thrombolytic therapy and evaluated with continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in the attempt to correlate total myocardial ischemia with shortterm prognosis Data in favor of the prognostic role of continuous electrocardiographic monitoring in unstable angina are also reviewed Finally we propose some suggestions that might be useful for future studies
R224	Medical records of seven patients treated within a 20 year period for malignant melanoma during pregnancy were reviewed No significant detrimental prognostic effects could be attributed to pregnancy The current literature on melanoma and pregnancy is discussed Based on this pregnancy seems not to be contraindicated in melanoma patients
R225	Twelve women undergoing laser ablation of the uterus for menorrhagia were studied by haemodynamic biochemical and haematological indices including radioisotope dilution studies of plasma volume to assess the degree of fluid absorption into the circulation during laser surgery There was a significant rise in central venous pressure and serum chloride and a significant decrease in plasma protein albumin and haematocrit Absorption of the irrigating fluid used was demonstrated and in one woman whose case history is illustrated this was excessive
R226	In a 22year period from 1962 to 1984 51 patients with malignant lung disease had a sleeve resection performed In 33 of the patients pneumonectomy was contraindicated because of limited lung function The operative mortality was 8 Six per cent of the patients developed complications after the operation The 5year survival of the total group of patients was 30 Patients with lesions classified as stage 1 and stage 2 had the best prognosis with a 5 and 10year survival of 435 and 27 respectively In patients classified as stage 3 and stage 4 the 5 and 10year survival was 20 A postoperative measurement of regional ventilation and perfusion indicated that the function of the remaining lung was presumably undisturbed by the operation Also the vital capacity and FEV 1 were only minimally reduced as a result of the operation The amount of functional lung tissue spared by the operation compared to pneumonectomy was estimated to 39 Because of these functional results and the promising 5year survival figures we suggest that sleeve lobectomy should be the operation of choice for tumors localized to the upper lobe orifice involving the main bronchus
R227	The authors have used the process of plastination to preserve gross anatomic specimens for teaching purposes A specimen is fixed in 10 buffered formalin and dehydrated in increasing grades of ethanol Thereafter it is saturated with methylene chloride and then impregnated in vacuo at 20 degrees C with silicone rubber Final steps involve drainage and exposure to a curing agent The total time required is approximately 16 weeks The finished plastinated specimen is dry to the touch odorless and nontoxic yet it maintains its original shape and in many cases is reasonably close in color and consistency It resists deterioration and can be stored at room temperature indefinitely The authors have found plastinated specimens to be superior to those preserved in formalin for teaching anatomic pathology to undergraduate medical students
R228	Sputum cytologic examination is still an important method for diagnosing lung cancer and it is simple to perform The present report is an analysis of 161 cases of primary lung cancer proved by thoracotomy A detection rate of 733 in sputum and 845 in combination with other cytologic methods have been obtained Cytotyping accuracy as compared with histologic classification in 105 cases was 790 The importance of examining more than three sputum samples from a patient with suspected lung cancer is stressed
R229	Infection with human immunodeficiency virus HIV impairs immune function Most abnormalities in host defense associated with HIV infection are due to helper Tcell dysfunction Studies defining these abnormalities in the HIVinfected patient have largely been done in adults A more complete understanding of the immunodeficiency that occurs in infants and young children congenitally infected with HIV awaits further study of their immune function and the effect this virus has on the developing immune system
R230	Two methods of in vivo dosimetry have been compared in a high energy neutron beam These were activation dosimetry and thermoluminescence dosimetry TLD Their suitability was determined by comparison with estimates of total dose obtained using a tissue equivalent ionization chamber Measurements were made on the central axis and a profile of a 10 x 10 cm square field and also behind a shielding block in order to simulate conditions of clinical use The TLD system was found to provide the best estimate of total dose
R231	The cellular mechanisms governing the expression of mononuclear cell vasculitis are poorly understood For determination of the precise sequence of events in the development of vasculitis in autoimmune MRLlpr mice histologic sections from 420weekold mice were evaluated with a panel of cytochemical and immunohistochemical stains The results show that vascular disease in MRLlpr mice develops as follows Thy 1 Ly 1 L3T4 T cells assemble around predominantly smalltomedium muscular arteries at approximately 8 weeks of age At 12 weeks of age an adventitial inflammatory focus forms composed of large reactive mononuclear inflammatory cells adjacent to hypertrophied vascular smooth muscle cells VSMCs Blastic Thy 1 Ly 1 L3T4 T cells subsequently infiltrate the tunica media and selective VSMC karyolysis results Occasional cytotoxicsuppressor T cells macrophages and possibly NK cells are noted primarily distal to the infiltration site The outer zone of the inflammatory infiltrate is composed of mature B cells and occasional Bcell precursors These findings suggest that cellular constituents of the immune response mediate mononuclear cell vasculitis in MRLlpr mice
R232	Mastectomy is frequently performed after intensive chemotherapy for locally advanced breast cancer The effects of preoperative chemotherapy on the postoperative course and the timing of subsequent adjuvant therapy however have not been defined We therefore reviewed the perioperative course of 54 patients undergoing mastectomy after combination CAMFPT chemotherapy for stage IIIAB IIIA  25 pts IIIB noninflammatory  5 pts IIIB inflammatory24 patients breast cancer A median of 7 cycles 6 months of chemotherapy was administered preoperatively Mastectomy was performed a median of 20 days after last chemotherapy white blood cell count WBC and platelet counts returned to normal limits preoperatively Total mastectomy with or without axillary node dissection was performed in 53 patients and a Halsted radical mastectomy in 1 patient Negative margins on breast andor axillary tissue were achieved in 47 patients 870 Postoperative complications included skin flap necrosis in 8 patients 148 seroma formation in 5 patients 93 and wound infection in 1 patient 19 Median operative blood loss 550 cc hospital stay 8 days and duration of wound catheter drainage 6 days were comparable to published reports for modified radical mastectomy without preoperative chemotherapy Systemic chemotherapy was resumed a median of 16 days after mastectomy and radiotherapy started a median of 33 days after mastectomy These findings indicate that intensive preoperative chemotherapy does not increase the hospital course or the postoperative complications of mastectomy for locally advanced breast cancer In view of the current interest in treatment of stage I and II breast cancer with preoperative chemotherapy this information may be useful in their management as well
R233	Vaginal adenosis and clear cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina occurred in a 44yearold woman after treatment for condylomata acuminata She had no known exposure to diethylstilbestrol DES in utero Biopsyproven vaginal adenosis appeared 8 months after intravaginal 5fluorouracil application for recurrent urogenital condylomata acuminata Forty months later biopsies showed residual adenosis with foci of clear cell adenocarcinoma Although clear cell adenocarcinoma is associated with vaginal adenosis and cervical ectropion in DESexposed women its occurrence in adenosis after 5fluorouracil therapy has not been reported to the authors knowledge In this report this rare but serious complication of treatment of condylomata acuminata is highlighted and the literature regarding the development of nonDESassociated vaginal adenosis is discussed
R234	A total of 74 clinical isolates of Branhamella catarrhalis were characterized with respect to their ampicillin amoxicillinclavulanate cephalothin cefaclor erythromycin tetracycline chloramphenicol and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole MICs and zones of inhibition Disk diffusion tests were performed according to the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards with two different media MuellerHinton agar and chocolate MuellerHinton agar and plates incubated under two atmospheric conditions ambient air and 5 to 7 CO2 Optimum disk diffusion test results were obtained with MuellerHinton agar plates incubated in ambient air with all eight antimicrobial agents On the basis of comparisons of MICs versus zones of inhibition the following zone diameter interpretive criteria were defined for testing B catarrhalis with disks containing 10 micrograms of ampicillin greater than or equal to 38 mm susceptible 20 to 37 mm moderately susceptible less than or equal to 19 mm resistant The respective MIC correlates were less than or equal to 006 0125 to 05 and greater than or equal to 10 microgramsml Because of the absence of frankly resistant test organisms it was not possible to make definitive recommendations pertaining to disk diffusion tests with amoxicillinclavulanate cephalothin cefaclor erythromycin tetracycline chloramphenicol and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole Evidence is presented however which suggests that the current National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards disk diffusion interpretive criteria for nonfastidious bacteria can be applied to B catarrhalis at least as they pertain to the susceptible category with cephalothin amoxicillinclavulanate erythromycin tetracycline chloramphenicol and trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole With cefaclor a zone diameter of greater than or equal to 21 mm was determined to adequately define the susceptible category
R235	The structure of the anterior epitympanic space was examined in 16 temporal bones The space showed three different structural types In all three types the posterior boundary of the space was marked by a bony plate jutting downward and covered by a mucous membrane No anterior boundary was found in type A 19 the space being continuous to a widened eustachian tube orifice In type B 31 the space was anteriorly bounded by a mucosal fold that continued to the tensor tympani fold In type C 50 the space assumed the shape of a bulge extending into the bony structure and sealed at the bottom by the tensor fold The ear surgeon is advised to be familiar with the structure of the anterior epitympanic space before intervening to remove cholesteatoma or create an anterior ventilation route
R236	The in vitro activity of S6123 a synthetic antimicrobial compound of the new oxazolidinone series was compared with those of other orally administered agents against 328 clinical isolates The compound was moderately active MICs 16 to 64 microgramsml against 90 of staphylococci nonenterococcal streptococci and Haemophilus influenzae including strains resistant to betalactam antibiotics S6123 was minimally active against enterococci and facultative gramnegative bacilli Nevertheless the compound had significant activity in a lethal rat Escherichia coli peritonitis model at serum concentrations of onetenth the MIC against the infecting organism The drug demonstrated only bacteriostatic activity against susceptible organisms Studies to define the mechanism of antibacterial action revealed that S6123 inhibited ribosomal protein synthesis without inhibiting DNA or RNA synthesis This compound represents a new series of antibacterial agents not related to any other antibacterial compound of natural or synthetic origin
R237	Interferon gamma IFNgamma is a potent inducer of major histocompatibility complex MHC antigens during normal immune responses and in abnormal responses in autoimmune disease In this report we identify two nuclear factors whose binding to the murine E beta class II MHC betachain gene is regulated by this cytokine IFNgamma stimulation of murine macrophages results in the appearance of increased binding of one protein complex complex A and decreased binding of a second faster migrating protein complex complex B Although the contact residues for both of these proteins lie within the highly conserved Ybox transcriptional element their binding specificity differs The protein in complex B is a CCAATboxbinding protein that may be similar or identical to NFY or YB1 previously identified class II Yboxbinding proteins The DNA sequence requirements for the binding of the slower migrating complex complex A are not limited to CCAATbox sequences but include sequences upstream of the Y box These upstream sequences are required both for IFNgammainduced gene transcription and for IFNgammainduced modulation of binding activity These data suggest a model in which upstream sequences contribute to formation of a lymphokineregulated complex downstream The IFNgammainduced binding protein described as complex A in this report differs from the IFNgamma alpha or betainduced nuclear factors previously identified
R238	The danger of ingestion or aspiration of a foreign body by a patient during dental treatment is always present This article discusses prevention and management of this event A case is presented in which aspiration of a dental casting into the tracheobronchial tree was not accompanied by symptoms suggestive of aspiration The patient had minimal symptoms after radiographic localization the object was removed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy with little discomfort to the patient The absence of symptoms suggestive of aspiration does not exclude this possibility
R239	We report the findings in a patient with the unusual complication of arteriovenous fistula formation of the subclavian vessels seven weeks following placement of a dualchamber pacemaker The fistulas subsequent course was equally unusual closing spontaneously three weeks later It is postulated that the thrombotic and fibrotic reaction elicited by the leads contributed to the fistulas closure Two surgical procedures correction of the fistula and reimplantation of the pacemaker were thus avoided by careful monitoring of the patient
R240	Attention is called to the fact that in cases of large ameloblastomas systematic careful treatment is essential This implies proper reconstruction of the jaw and restoration of the occlusion after adequate extirpation of the tumor A case involving a large mandibular ameloblastoma is reported It was successfully treated step by step by tumor extirpation jaw reconstruction with rib transplants and installation of titanium implants Biotes in the rib transplants anterior vestibuloplasty with skin graft and finally an overdenture Carefully planned coordination of welldocumented surgical and prosthetic procedures has achieved a functionally and esthetically successful result
R241	We have studied the biologic and physical properties of a monoclonal antibody that binds to gp120 the exterior envelope glycoprotein of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV strain HTLVIIIB Designated 9284 the antibody possesses viral neutralizing activity and inhibits syncytium formation by infected cells The antibody recognized a region of the polypeptide backbone previously described as an important neutralizing epitope This region lies 307330 residues from amino terminus of the glycoprotein We have compared the biologic and physical properties of this antibody to those of the recently described 05 beta monoclonal antibody to gp120 The 05 beta antibody was biologically more potent and bound an epitope slightly downstream to that of the 9284 antibody The antibodies did not differ significantly in their affinity for gp120 In competition studies the 05 beta antibody was displaced by the 9284 antibody but the binding of the latter was unaffected by 05 beta
R242	A new infant ventilator for both normal and highfrequency ventilation is described High pressure gas delivered via a jet in the breathing limb of a Tpiece in which there are no valves drives respiratory fresh gas RFG supplied to the tracheal tube from any low pressure source into the lungs Observations on anesthetized rabbits showed that after setting up for a PaCO2 of 36 torr at 30 cyclemin it remained around 36 torr when the ventilation frequency was progressively increased to 200 cyclemin The mean peak proximal airway and tracheal pressures were 13 and 12 11 and 7 and 13 cm H2O PEEP 21 cm H2O and 74 cm H2O PEEP 31 cm H2O at 30 100 and 200 cyclemin respectively In this open valveless breathing system desynchronized spontaneous and artificial ventilation occurred quietly without any marked variation in the airway pressures This preliminary study on a new pneumatic system shows its potential for simplifying and improving infant ventilation
R243	Facial burn scars are difficult to conceal and often preclude an aesthetic rehabilitation of the patient Multistaged scalp and neck flaps have been described to provide hairbearing skin to resurface burn scars in men We have been resurfacing the upper lip and cheek in a onestage procedure using a temporal artery island scalp flap The temporoparietal fascia has been well described in recent years and the understanding of this anatomy has facilitated the use of the island scalp flap for more distal transfers
R244	Twenty patients with inoperable carcinoma in the trachea or a main bronchus were investigated before and one and 10 days after treatment with a carbon dioxide laser Patients were assessed by spirometry maximum flowvolume loops and a visual analogue score of breathlessness on a scale from 0 not at all breathless to 100 very breathless At day 10 mean FEV1 had improved from 519 to 626 of predicted p less than 002 and mean peak expiratory flow PEF from 453 to 531 of the predicted value p less than 005 Improvements in maximum inspiratory and expiratory flows at 50 vital capacity were not significant but the breathlessness score decreased from a mean of 491 to 353 p less than 001 Improvements in breathlessness were significantly correlated with increases in FEV1 and PEF Thirteen of the 20 patients had unilateral tumours with partial or complete occlusion of the main bronchus in these perfusion and ventilation were assessed by radioisotope scans before and 10 days after treatment Seven of the 13 patients showed an increase in perfusion of the affected lung after treatment but the improvement was small with a mean increase in unilateral perfusion in the 13 patients of 24 of the total counts Four patients with no perfusion of the affected side showed no significant improvement after laser treatment Changes in ventilation scans were similar to those in perfusion It is concluded that laser treatment improves airway function and dyspnoea in malignant narrowing of central airways and that in unilateral obstruction such treatment results at best in a small increase in the contribution of the affected lung to perfusion
R245	The structural requirements of skeletal reconstruction should be included in the consideration of an appropriate type of bone graft whether autogenous or allogeneic tissues are chosen This analysis should include the nature of any fixation devices to be used as well as characteristics of the host and donor bone The mechanical properties and biomechanical response of the graft must be balanced against the type and magnitude of the load to which the graft will be subject For example the information presented here suggests that from a biomechanical perspective frozen bone would be better suited than freezedried bone when the graft is subject to large torsional loads or else the graft must be appropriately protected during incorporation by adequate internal fixation or external bracing In a situation that is primarily subjected to compressive loads however freezedried grafts would be just as biomechanically sound Thus an understanding of the normal biomechanics of the anatomic region to be reconstructed is crucial The mechanical properties of the graft are affected by preservation storage and sterilization Incorporation and remodeling of the graft further alter its properties These properties are in turn influenced by the host immune response as well as the local biomechanical environment The influence of each of these factors is predictable Obviously there are numerous considerations in choosing approaches to skeletal reconstruction other than the mechanical issues discussed here However an understanding of the mechanical properties involved will help in optimizing the clinical success of these choices
R246	All 24 cases of confirmed and evaluable Stage I favorable histology FH Wilms tumor WT relapsing to date on the Third National Wilms Tumor Study NWTS3 were compared with 48 matched control subjects who had not relapsed for at least 2 years after diagnosis Fifteen of the clinical and pathological variables studied including patient age and tumor size had no significant relationship to the outcome of this study Four histologic features all related to the degree of tumor extension within the tumorkidney unit proved to be significantly associated with relapse These were 1 invasion of the tumor capsule 2 presence of an inflammatory pseudocapsule 3 renal sinus invasion and 4 tumor in intrarenal vessels One or more of these features was present in 100 of relapsed cases excluding one for which two variables were unevaluable but occurred in only 46 of controls P less than 00002 Therefore no relapses occurred in the NWTS3 when all four variables were negative This result was confirmed by a review of all Stage I cases in the NWTS1 who had relapsed and who were treated by singleagent chemotherapy Again no relapses occurred when all four factors were negative These results demonstrate the feasibility of microsubstaging and could serve as a basis for future refinements of therapy for Stage I favorable histology Wilms tumor
R247	The authors compared histamine release in vitro in a human neonatal foreskin preparation to histamine release in vivo in adult humans with three commonly used muscle relaxants vecuronium atracurium and dtubocurarine in concentrations ranging from 101 M to 3 X 103 M They measured histamine release directly in the in vitro preparation and measured the wheal size resulting from intradermal injection in vivo Both in vivo and in vitro testing revealed doserelated histamine release with dtubocurarine and atracurium P less than 05 Vecuronium did not release histamine at any concentration It was concluded that the infant foreskin model is a valid predictor of histamine release by muscle relaxants in vivo and can provide valuable information about mechanisms of histamine release by these and perhaps others drugs used in anesthetic practice
R248	We have presented the case of an adult with a chronic and indolent pneumococcal vertebral osteomyelitis mimicking a malignancy and making diagnosis difficult The increased frequency of relatively penicillinresistant strains of pneumococci necessitates susceptibility testing and complicates the selection of antibiotic therapy for serious pneumococcal infections
R249	The sporulation operon spoIIA of Bacillus subtilis consists of three cistrons called spoIIAA spoIIAB and spoIIAC Little is known about the function of spoIIAA and spoIIAB but spoIIAC encodes a sigma factor called sigma F which is capable of directing the transcription in vitro of genes that are expressed in the forespore chamber of the developing sporangium We now report that the products of the spoIIA operon constitute a regulatory system in which SpoIIAA is an antagonist of SpoIIAB or otherwise counteracts the effect of SpoIIAB and SpoIIAB is in turn an antagonist of SpoIIAC sigma F This conclusion is based on the observations that i overexpression of spoIIAB inhibits sigma Fdirected gene expression ii a mutation in spoIIAB stimulates sigma Fdirected gene expression iii a mutation in spoIIAA blocks sigma Fdirected gene expression and iv a mutation in spoIIAB relieves the block in sigma Fdirected gene expression caused by a mutation in spoIIAA The SpoIIAASpoIIABSpoIIAC regulatory system could play a role in controlling the timing of sigma Fdirected gene expression andor could be responsible for restricting sigma Fdirected gene expression to the forespore chamber of the sporangium
R250	Facial sweating associated with eating develops occasionally after thoracic sympathectomy Its occurrence has never been previously documented in association with a tumor in the upper chest This report describes the first case of Pancoasts tumor presenting as hemifacial gustatory sweating
R251	A total of 50 lung cancer CA patients and 20 normal persons as controls were included in our study We obtained lymphocytes from heparinized blood by FicollHypaque gradient method and after the macrophages were removed they were incubated with 51Crlabelled K562 cells at concentrations of 1001 501 1251 for four hours We calculated the cytotoxicity activity and lytic unit LU of natural killer NK cells Significant impairment was noted in the comparison of NK cytotoxicity and LU between stage IIIM1 lung CA patients n  28 and the control group However significant impairment was also noted in stage IIIM1 and IIIM0 patients Four cases in stage I underwent surgery and the NK cytotoxicity before the operation was noted to be low After the operation the NK cytotoxicity increased These results indicate that NK cytotoxicity assay was impaired in stage IIIM1 lung CA and also suggest that it may act as a therapeutic guide in determining the results of the operation
R252	Though classically a disease of the near term nullipara the chameleonlike presentation of preeclampsia makes the diagnosis at times difficult and in most circumstances presumptive A high index of suspicion is important Early and frequent prenatal examinations coupled with laboratory parameters should reduce diagnostic error
R253	Measurement of the pulmonary excretion of trace gases has been used as a simple means of assessing metabolic reactions End alveolar trace gas concentration rather than excretory rate is usually measured However the reproducibility of this measurement has received little attention In 17 healthy subjects duplicate collections of alveolar air were obtained within 1 minute of each other using a commercially available alveolar air sampler The concentrations of hydrogen methane carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide were measured When the subject received no instruction on how to expire into the device a difference of 28  19 1SD was found between duplicate determinations of hydrogen Instructing the subjects to avoid hyperventilation or to inspire maximally and exhale immediately resulted in only minor reduction in variability However a maximal inspiration held for 15 seconds before exhalation reduced the difference to a mean of 96  80 less than half that observed with the other expiratory techniques Percentage difference of methane measurements with the four different expiratory techniques yielded results comparable to those obtained for hydrogen In contrast percentage differences for carbon monoxide measurements were similar for all expiratory techniques When normalized to a PCO2 of 5 the variability of hydrogen measurements with the breathholding technique was reduced to 68  47 a value significantly lower than that obtained with the other expiratory methods This study suggests that attention to the expiratory technique could improve the accuracy of tests using breath hydrogen measurements
R254	The most common complication of chronic pancreatitis is pain which in many cases seems related to pancreatic ductal obstruction with ductal hypertension Longitudinal pancreaticojejunostomy is indicated in patients with a dilated larger than 7 mm duct and pain that requires narcotic analgesics for relief Chronic pseudocysts may be corrected surgically without the usual 6week wait and asymptomatic pseudocysts less than 4 cm in diameter may not require surgery at all The relative efficacy and risks of percutaneous drainage of pseudocysts versus the standard surgical approaches need to be studied Pancreatic fistulas may be external or internal where pancreatic ascites or hydrothorax can be the clinical manifestation The pharmacologic suppression of pancreatic secretion eg with somatostatin may be useful in their management but surgery may be required Pancreatic resection or internal drainage is usually effective Persistent jaundice should be relieved surgically by choledochoduodenostomy to avoid the development of secondary biliary cirrhosis Obstruction at various levels of the gastrointestinal tract duodenum small bowel colon may require bypass gastrojejunostomy or resection Hemorrhage from major arteries is an infrequent but often lethal complication of chronic pancreatitis especially associated with pseudocysts Angiography is invaluable for diagnosis and occasionally for treatment embolization Surgery is preferred in goodrisk patients with suture ligation resection of the bleeding source Chronic pancreatitis is the most common cause of splenic vein thrombosis The resultant hemorrhage from gastric varices is managed effectively by splenectomy
R255	The spectrum of recognized cardiac lesions underlying infective endocarditis has been changing as a result of the decline in incidence of rheumatic heart disease the recognition of the entity of mitral valve prolapse and the improvement in cardiac diagnostic techniques Sixtythree cases of native valve endocarditis diagnosed in Memphis hospitals between 1980 and 1984 were reviewed All diagnoses of underlying cardiac lesions were confirmed by twodimensional echocardiography cardiac catheterization andor histopathologic examination of valve tissues Major categories of underlying lesions were as follows mitral valve prolapse 29 percent no underlying disease 27 percent degenerative lesions of the aortic or mitral valve 21 percent congenital heart disease 13 percent rheumatic heart disease 6 percent Thus mitral valve prolapse and in the elderly degenerative lesions have displaced rheumatic and congenital heart diseases as the major conditions underlying endocarditis Redundancy of the mitral valve leaflets was noted in 17 of 18 patients in whom endocarditis was superimposed upon mitral valve prolapse The risk of infective endocarditis appears to be substantially increased in the subset of patients with mitral valve prolapse who exhibit valvular redundancy
R256	A radioimmunoassay was assessed for its suitability for monitoring the blood and urinary concentrations of bleomycin entrapped within large unilamellar liposomes in patients receiving therapeutic doses of the drug Bleomycin entrapped within liposomes was administered by direct intracerebral injection to three patients with grade III to IV cerebral gliomas twice weekly for up to six weeks No clinically important toxic effects were observed which could have been attributed to these preparations although all three patients showed progressive deterioration in their clinical condition This type of treatment may be more beneficial to patients at an earlier stage of their disease
R257	The effect of betacarotene on tumor immunity was examined with the use of a syngeneic murine tumor system Oral administration of betacarotene 120 microgramsmouseday for 9 days from day 1 to the BALBc mice inoculated sc with 107 syngeneic BALBc Meth A fibrosarcoma cells Meth A led to a remarkable rejection against rechallenged Meth A implanted sc on day 10 The growth of Meth 1 fibrosarcoma Meth 1 another syngeneic tumor of BALBc origin as a rechallenge tumor was unaffected by treatment with betacarotene thereby suggesting that betacarotene may augment tumor rejection specific to tumorspecific antigens Winn assay revealed that the suppressive effect on tumor growth of immune lymph node cells obtained from Meth Ainoculated betacarotenetreated mice on day 12 was enhanced dose dependently Primary effector cells responsible for the augmented rejection are Thy1positive Lyt1negative and Lyt2positive lymphocytes presumably cytotoxic Tlymphocytes
R258	Data from a random sample of 8515 white adults residing in 6 cities in the eastern and midwestern United States were used to examine the relationships between occupational exposures to dust or to gases and fumes and chronic respiratory symptoms 31 of the population had a history of occupational dust exposure and 30 reported exposure to gas or fumes After adjusting for smoking habits age gender and city of residence subjects with either occupational exposure had significantly elevated prevalences of chronic cough chronic phlegm persistent wheeze and breathlessness The adjusted relative odds of chronic respiratory symptoms for subjects exposed to dust ranged from 132 to 160 Subjects with gas or fume exposure had relative odds of symptoms between 127 and 143 when compared with unexposed subjects Occupational dust exposure was associated with a higher prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease as defined by an FEV1FVC ratio of less than 06 when comparing exposed and unexposed participants OR  153 95 Cl  117208 Gas or fume exposure was associated with a small but not significant increase in COPD prevalence Significant trends were noted for wheeze and phlegm with increasing duration of dust exposure Although 36 of exposed subjects reported exposure to both dust and fumes there was no evidence of a multiplicative interaction between the effects of the individual exposures Smoking was a significant independent predictor of symptoms but did not appear to modify the effect of dust or fumes on symptom reporting These data obtained in random samples of general populations demonstrate that chronic respiratory symptoms and disease can be independently associated with occupational exposures
R259	Correction of a coarctation of the aorta an apparent simple cause of hypertension paradoxically can provoke two hypertensive responses one of which is potentially fatal The first limited to the first 24 hours occurs in nearly one half of the patients This is likely due to the high set of the carotid baroreceptors The second which may be associated with abdominal pain and in some with necrosis of the small bowel as a result of severe arteritis confined to arteries arising from the aorta below the coarctation develops in about one half of the first responders Norepinephrine excretion greatly increases for several days whereas angiotensin levels are elevated for 3 to 4 days The hypertension responds to betablockers to arterial smooth muscle relaxants and to angiotensin converting enzymes A theory is advanced to explain the second response It is the adaptation gone awry that ensures adequate flow to exercising muscles below the coarctation above and beyond that delivered by increasing the systolic pressure It could be a regionally controlled mechanism similar to the rationing of blood flow in diving mammals
R260	Inositol 145trisphosphate Ins145P3 a second messenger molecule involved in actions of neurotransmitters hormones and growth factors releases calcium from vesicular nonmitochondrial intracellular stores An Ins145P3 binding protein purified from brain membranes has been shown to be phosphorylated by cyclicAMPdependent protein kinase and localized by immunohistochemical techniques to intracellular particles associated with the endoplasmic reticulum Although the specificity of the Ins145P3 binding protein for inositol phosphates and the high affinity of the protein for Ins145P3 indicate that it is a physiological Ins145P3 receptor mediating calcium release direct evidence for this has been difficult to obtain Also it is unclear whether a single protein mediates both the recognition of Ins145P3 and calcium transport or whether these two functions involve two or more distinct proteins In the present study we report reconstitution of the purified Ins145P3 binding protein into lipid vesicles We show that Ins145P3 and other inositol phosphates stimulate calcium flux in the reconstituted vesicles with potencies and specificities that match the calcium releasing actions of Ins145P3 These results indicate that the purified Ins145P3 binding protein is a physiological receptor responsible for calcium release
R261	The cloning construction and expression of chimeric Ig genes encoding a mAb directed against the human transferrin receptor is described From a mouse hybridoma cell line secreting an antitransferrin receptor antibody mRNA was prepared and converted into cDNA using Igspecific oligonucleotides H and L chain encoding cDNA fragments were isolated and sequenced Chimeric genes were constructed by linking the murine V region cDNA fragments to human C region exons After sequential transfection of nonproducing mouse hybridoma cells with the expression vectors containing the chimeric H and L chain genes antibody secreting transfectomas were obtained ELISA and immunoblot analysis clearly demonstrate the secretion of human kappa and gamma1 chain Flow microfluorimetry analysis of the chimeric antibody shows that the Agbinding capacity has been retained The chimeric antibody most likely will be less immunogenic then the original mouse antibody when used in human cancer therapy
R262	A technique for performing retrograde catheterization of the left atrium followed by double balloon mitral valvuloplasty without transseptal catheterization is described Three patients have undergone double balloon mitral valvuloplasty by means of this technique all with marked improvement in postdilatation mitral valve areas The technique avoids iatrogenic atrial septal defects and is less difficult to perform than transseptal catheterization
R263	A case of primary pulmonary lymphoma presenting as a nodular lesion on the chest radiograph in a patient with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome is described
R264	Normal differentiation and malignant transformation of human cells are characterized by specific changes in surface antigen phenotype In the present study we have defined six cellsurface antigens of human sarcomas and normal mesenchymal cells by using mixed hemadsorption assays and immunochemical methods for the analysis of cultured cells and immunohistochemical staining for the analysis of normal tissues and greater than 200 tumor specimens Differential patterns of F19 Mr 12000095000 glycoprotein F24 Mr 95000 glycoprotein G171 Mr 75000 glycoprotein G253 Mr 90000 glycoprotein S5 Mr 120000 glycoprotein and Thy1 Mr 25000 glycoprotein antigen expression were found to characterize i subsets of cultured sarcoma cell lines ii cultured fibroblasts derived from various organs iii normal resting and activated mesenchymal tissues and iv sarcoma and nonmesenchymal tumor tissues These results provide a basic surface antigenic map for cultured mesenchymal cells and mesenchymal tissues and permit the classification of human sarcomas according to their antigenic phenotypes
R265	This is an analysis of 37 previously untreated patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the maxillary sinus treated with curative intent at the University of Florida from January 1966 through January 1984 All patients were followed for at least two years and 86 per cent 3227 were followed for a minimum of five years Patients were treated for cure with radiation therapy alone 25 surgery alone 1 or surgery and preoperative 6 or postoperative 5 radiation therapy This study presents the results of treatment and the incidence of treatmentrelated complications in this group of patients
R266	Thymectomy is an accepted therapeutic modality for patients with myasthenia gravis The selection of patients for operation and the surgical approach are controversial We reviewed 52 patients aged 18 months to 82 years mean age 34 years treated with transsternal radical thymectomy between 1972 and 1987 Patients were symptomatically staged according to the modified Osserman classification There was one hospital death and postoperative followup was obtained on 51 patients Improvement after thymectomy was observed in 3 of 11 patients 27 in Osserman stage I 16 of 25 patients 64 in Osserman stage IIA and 13 of 15 patients 86 in combined Osserman stages IIB III and IV Preoperative Osserman stage patient sex and thymic histology correlated with postoperative clinical response Transsternal radical thymectomy is effective therapy for myasthenia gravis Sustained improvement is obtained in patients with moderate and advanced disease The majority of patients with ocular disease do not benefit from operation
R267	Left ventricular performance was evaluated noninvasively in 111 patients participating at one study center in the Norwegian Multicenter Study on Timolol After Myocardial Infarction Systolic time intervals were measured in 55 patients treated with timolol and in 56 patients receiving placebo Measurements were made before randomization and after 1 3 and 12 months of treatment During the treatment period the preejection periodleft ventricular ejection time ratio was significantly lower in the timololtreated group indicating better left ventricular function than in the placebotreated patients In the 27 patients who died during the followup period of 50 to 72 months there was a significant increase in the preejection periodleft ventricular ejection time ratio from baseline to the last performed recording indicating a deterioration in left ventricular performance in these patients No such change occurred in the group that survived the entire followup period Deterioration of left ventricular function is related to a high longterm mortality rate after myocardial infarction and left ventricular function is better preserved in patients treated with timolol than in patients receiving placebo
R268	To assess the role of immunization against hepatitis delta antigen in the prevention of hepatitis delta virus infection woodchuck carriers of woodchuck hepatitis virus were immunized with a 64 amino acid portion of hepatitis delta antigen from its Nterminal region The protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and contained a major immunogenic epitope A significant antihepatitis delta response was observed that did not however protect the animals from hepatitis delta virus superinfection Unexpectedly the period of detectable viremia was longer in the immunized than in the control animals We conclude that immunization with this recombinant hepatitis delta antigen does not afford protection against subsequent hepatitis delta virus exposure
R269	Because the pubertal growth spurt in boys appears to be mediated by both androgens and estrogens we hypothesized that blockade of both androgen action and estrogen synthesis would normalize the growth of boys with familial male precocious puberty To test this hypothesis we studied nine boys age range 33 to 77 years during treatment with an antiandrogen spironolactone or an inhibitor of androgentoestrogen conversion testolactone followed by treatment with both agents After six months of observation without treatment the first four boys received spironolactone for six months followed by spironolactone and testolactone The next five boys received testolactone for six months followed by spironolactone and testolactone Neither spironolactone nor testolactone given alone was satisfactory as a treatment for this condition However a combination of spironolactone and testolactone given for at least six months restored both the growth rate and the rate of bone maturation to normal prepubertal levels and controlled acne spontaneous erections and aggressive behavior The combined therapy was associated with a significantly lower growth rate than testolactone alone P less than 005 and a significantly lower rate of bone maturation than spironolactone alone P less than 005 No important adverse effects were observed during combined treatment Six of the nine boys continued to receive the combined therapy for an additional 12 months and maintained normal prepubertal rates of growth and bone maturation The mean predicted height  SEM increased progressively during the combined treatment although the difference between the pretreatment and posttreatment predictions was not significant 1695  28 at the end of treatment vs 1662  45 cm before treatment P  029 We conclude that blockade of both androgen action and estrogen synthesis with the combination of spironolactone and testolactone is an effective shortterm treatment for familial male precocious puberty Further study will be required however to assess the longterm outcome in boys who receive this treatment
R270	Of 142 Chiari pelvic osteotomies for osteoarthritis in dysplastic hips most performed by Chiari himself we were able to review 82 and obtain information about 18 by questionnaire All patients were over 30 years of age at operation followup averaged 155 years Twenty hips had undergone secondary total hip replacement The outcome was good in 75 fair in 9 and poor in 16 High osteotomies all gave good results and the result also depended on adequate medialisation Statistics were worse for patients over 44 years of age at the time of operation For osteoarthritis secondary to hip dysplasia the Chiari pelvic osteotomy is an alternative procedure to early hip replacement In contrast to intertrochanteric osteotomy it has the advantage of facilitating the implantation of an acetabular prosthesis should arthroplasty become necessary at a later stage
R271	Between 1982 and 1986 we have had the chance to study 21 patients with pemphigus foliaceus of the fogo selvagem type The patients came from El Bagre and Nechi rural areas of Colombia with some gold mining This is the first outbreak of South American pemphigus foliaceus reported in Colombia The majority of the patients were mestizo men who worked as farmers or miners or both with an average age of 44 Five patients were relatives Eleven patients 52 had mild disease three 14 moderate disease and seven 33 severe disease During hospitalization three patients died due to complications or as a result of immunosuppressive treatment Of the remaining 18 patients 10 were in remission with treatment one was in remission without treatment while no information was available on the remaining seven
R272	Peptide YY PYY a newly discovered ileocolonic peptide is released by nutrients in the proximal and distal intestine and inhibits pancreatic secretion However it is not clear whether PYY can be released in the absence of nutrients in the intestine or whether a physiological role exists for endogenous PYY in negative feedback regulation of pancreatic secretion by pancreatic proteases In the present study we measured plasma PYY concentrations and determined the effects of antiPYY serum during stimulation of pancreatic secretion by pancreatic juice diversion PJD The effect of SMS 201995 SMS an analog of somatostatin another inhibitor of pancreatic secretion on regulation of PYY release induced by PJD was also investigated Male Wistar rats equipped with pancreatic biliary duodenal and jugular venous cannulas were studied 46 days postoperatively After 90 min of basal collection pancreatic juice was diverted for 4 h with or without infusion of SMS 2 microgramskgh given either iv or intraduodenally ID Plasma PYY concentrations were significantly increased from a basal level of 177  15 pgml to a peak level of 328  43 pgml 2 h after PJD These increases in PYY concentration paralleled those in pancreatic protein and fluid outputs Both iv and ID infusion of SMS during the first 2 h of PJD markedly decreased the plasma PYY concentration to 134  27 pgml and 156  19 pgml respectively the total incremental PYY release during 4 h of PJD was inhibited by 100 and 84 by iv and ID SMS respectively One milliliter of antiPYY serum given iv significantly augmented the increment in protein and fluid output during PJD These results suggest that endogenous PYY released by PJD may play a physiological role in negative feedback regulation of pancreatic secretion in rats
R273	Antibody therapy holds great promise for the treatment of cancer autoimmune disorders and viral infections Murine monoclonal antibodies are relatively easy to produce but are severely restricted for therapeutic use by their immunogenicity in humans Production of human monoclonal antibodies has been problematic Humanized antibodies can be generated by introducing the six hypervariable regions from the heavy and light chains of a murine antibody into a human framework sequence and combining it with human constant regions We humanized with the aid of computer modeling two murine monoclonal antibodies against herpes simplex virus gB and gD glycoproteins The binding virus neutralization and cell protection results all indicate that both humanized antibodies have retained the binding activities and the biological properties of the murine monoclonal antibodies
R274	Protriptyline 20 mg daily reduced the total time spent in rapid eye movement sleep in an open study in four subjects with Duchenne muscular dystrophy Sleep related hypoxaemia and episodes of desaturation were reduced Anticholinergic side effects were prominent however in these patients precluding its use for regular treatment
R275	Acetylcholine ACh is considered to play a primary role in normal mnemonic functioning Although most research has centered on the central muscarinic cholinergic system of recent interest in normal and pathologic cognitive processing is the role of the nicotinic cholinergic system The purpose of this research was to further characterize the role of the nicotinic system in learning and memory processing in a classical passive avoidance task by rats The centrally acting nicotinic antagonist mecamylamine produced a dosedependent impairment of performance in the passive avoidance task however the peripherally acting nicotinic antagonist hexamethonium was ineffective in this test To elucidate the potential neurochemical mechanisms underlying mecamylamines amnestic effect we examined the ability of the drug to alter specific dynamic components of rat brain cholinergic systems in five brain regions Mecamylamine produced a dosedependent inhibition of the synthesis of 3HACh from pulseinjected 3Hcholine in all regions examined but was without effect on endogenous steadystate levels of ACh As with the behavioral study administration of hexamethonium was without effect on 3HACh synthesis Calculation of the turnover rates of ACh allowed a correlation between the inhibition of the behavioral task and the inhibition of central cholinergic function The high degree of correlation obtained as well as earlier studies in nonhuman primates underlined the possibility that presynaptically located nicotinic receptors on brain cholinergic neurons are tonically active and mediate a positive feedback mechanism for controlling cholinergic neuronal activity These receptors may be the neurochemical substrate which underlie the behavioral changes after administration of nicotinic agonists and antagonists
R276	Magnetic resonance imaging MRI is a powerful tool providing highresolution images of the heart and great vessels without the use of ionizing radiation or contrast agents MRI systems currently in use at many hospitals can be used effectively in the routine clinical evaluation of many forms of cardiovascular disease including great vessel disease ischemic cardiac disease and congenital cardiac disease Moreover quantitative and cine MRI techniques are now available which provide highly accurate measures of chamber size wall motion and wall thickening Recent developments in the areas of myocardial tagging highspeed imaging and MR assessments of flow and perfusion suggest potential for an increasing role of MRI in the clinical evaluation of the cardiovascular system
R277	We present three patients with Bowens disease of the fingernail folds and beds in which there was polydactylous involvement and add those to five similarly afflicted patients described by other authors Bowens disease of the nail is a distinctive type of squamous cell carcinoma that differs from other variants It is potentially an autochthonous process that can involve more than one nail with the passage of time Seveneighths of the patients described in this series were men A majority had involvement of both hands No metastases were seen
R278	Flow cytometric DNA histograms of colorectal carcinomas from 264 patients were evaluated for the association of tumor site Dukes stage tumor grade and preoperative carcinoembryonic level with patient survival The DNA nondiploid carcinomas were significantly more common from the left descending and sigmoid colon and the rectum A poorer prognosis was found for patients with DNA nondiploid cancers than for patients with DNA diploid cancers This was particularly true for patients with Dukes stages B2 and C tumors with a small number one to three of lymph nodes with metastatic deposits The DNA nondiploid cancers also had a relatively poorer prognosis in patients with unresectable disease In a Cox multivariate analysis model the DNA pattern was an independent prognostic variable for this group of 264 patients with resected colorectal carcinoma
R279	Cells with increased chromosome number and DNA content have been found in the spleens of old NZB mice These hyperdiploid cells are of clonal origin and demonstrate discrete IgH chain gene rearrangements by Southern blot analysis In this report hyperdiploid cells were analyzed by threecolor flow cytometric techniques and found to be Ly1 B cells which were dull for Ly1 and bright for surface IgM These cells unlike typical diploid Ly1 B cells were negative for B2206B2 and surface IgD Hyperdiploid Ly1 B cells were found to be the predominant splenic subpopulation in animals receiving a spleen cell transfer from donors which possessed hyperdiploid Ly1 B cells NZB x DBA2F1 recipients of NZB spleen cells demonstrated a 10 to 1000fold increase in Ly1 B cells in the spleen but showed no increased levels of Ly1 B cells in the peritoneum Nearly all the splenic Ly1 B cells were hyperdiploid with the phenotype of the NZB parent Cytogenetic analysis revealed that all the hyperdiploid cells were NZB donor cells These findings suggest that the increase in splenic Ly1 B cells in the F1 recipients was due to expansion of injected splenic hyperdiploid Ly1 B cells of NZB origin All of the F1 recipients of NZB hyperdiploid Ly1 B cells demonstrated a significant decrease in endogenous B cells as well as decreased serum IgM and antissDNA autoantibodies These studies suggest that hyperdiploid Ly1 B cells are different from typical peritoneal Ly1 B cells both in the lymphoid organs to which they home and in their proliferative capacity NZB hyperdiploid Ly1 B cells which may arise as a natural consequence of hyperactive Ly1 B cells may play an immunoregulatory role in the spleen
R280	The activity of Nacetylglucosamine6phosphate deacetylase a key enzyme in the pathway of Nacetylglucosamine catabolism was measured in hepatocytes Kupffer cells and sinusoidal endothelial cells from rat liver and cultured human skin fibroblasts Kupffer cells and endothelial cells had similar high levels of deacetylase activity that were more than twice the level observed in fibroblasts In contrast hepatocytes had extremely low activity several hundredfold less than Kupffer cells and endothelial cells A major implication of deacetylase deficiency in hepatocytes is that Nacetylglucosamine generated as a result of the catabolism of complex carbohydrates in these cells cannot enter glycolysis and must be largely reused for the synthesis of plasma glycoproteins and other Nacetylglucosaminecontaining macromolecules
R281	Despite numerous reports of findings obtained following the use of doxorubicin Adriamycin A Adria Laboratories Columbus OH for the postoperative treatment of patients with primary breast cancer and positive axillary nodes no clear consensus exists regarding its worth when used in that setting In June 1981 the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project NSABP implemented two randomized clinical trials aimed at evaluating the worth of doxorubicin when administered in conjunction with melphalan LPAM and fluorouracil 5FU PF A prior NSABP study identified cohorts of patients who did or did not benefit from tamoxifen TAM T when used with chemotherapy That information was employed in the design of the present studies Women considered responsive to TAM 1106 were randomized between PFT and PAFT and those nonresponsive to TAM 707 were randomized between PF and PAF Findings through 6 years of followup mean duration of potential time on study 64 months and 63 months respectively indicate that nonTAMresponsive patients who received PAF had a significantly better diseasefree survival DFS P  003 and survival P  05 than did those receiving PF By contrast there was no significant difference in DFS P  6 or survival P  7 between PFT and PAFTtreated patients No disparity in the amount of drug received whether related to the median amount or to doseintensity is present to account for the difference in findings between the studies Aside from alopecia and emesis the toxicity from the doxorubicincontaining regimens was similar to those in which doxorubicin was omitted Cardiomyopathy was not a significant finding there were no deaths from cardiac toxicity The incidence of arterial and venous complications in patients receiving TAM was less than reported by others
R282	Helper T lymphocytes recognize fragments of foreign or self antigens in the peptidebinding clefts of major histocompatibility complex class II molecules their activation is a crucial step in the induction of many immune and autoimmune responses While studying the latter we raised a Tcell line from the thymus of a myasthenia gravis patient against recombinant alpha subunit of the human acetylcholine receptor the target of this autoimmune disease The line responds to the 144156 region of the human sequence and not to the same region of the electric fish homolog which differs by only three residues These CD4 T cells recognize this epitope only in the context of HLADR4 class II molecules of which the variants with Gly86 are absolutely required Thus the naturally occurring alternatives Dw142 Gly86 and Dw141 Val86which differ only at this one position in the entire antigenbinding regionshow an allornothing difference in presenting activity This dimorphism at position 86 is widespread occurring in subtypes of DR1 DR2 DR3 DR5 and DR6 alleles as well as DR4 Since other DR4 subtypes with substitutions at positions 7074 also fail to present this peptide and glycine residues can be uniquely flexible we suggest that this replacement at position 86 acts locally or at a distance by altering the conformation of the peptidebinding cleft Such profound functional consequences for Tcell recognition as we report here may explain this example of conserved major histocompatibility complex diversity
R283	In order to determine prognostic factors in noncardiac medical patients treated by mechanical ventilation in a Veterans Administration hospital 78 patient records were reviewed Disease severity was scored by the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation APACHE II system Physicians prior impressions of prognostic factors were compared with the actual results of this study Most patients were middleaged men with respiratory diseases Fiftynine patients 76 percent died in the hospital Survivors of hospitalization and nonsurvivors had similar age diagnoses emergency intubations duration of ventilation and pH and oxygen tension after 24 hours of ventilation However only one of 31 patients with a serum albumin level of 25 gdl or less at the initiation of mechanical ventilation survived p less than 0001 Of 24 patients requiring a fractional inspired oxygen concentration greater than 50 percent at 24 hours none survived p less than 0005 At all APACHE II scores the mortality rates documented in this study were higher than predicted Physicians overestimated the impact of several variables including age and presence of pneumonia on mortality At the San Francisco Veterans Administration Medical Center a low serum albumin level may aid in the decision whether to begin mechanical ventilation and a high fractional inspired oxygen concentration at 24 hours may aid in the decision regarding further aggressive care These findings need to be validated in other patients before being applied Conversely certain older patients and those undergoing emergency intubation or intubation for a prolonged time may have as good a prognosis as patients without these factors
R284	Two mammalian gene products PC2 and PC3 have been proposed as candidate neuroendocrineprecursor processing enzymes based on the structural similarity of their catalytic domains to that of the yeast precursorprocessing endoprotease Kex2 In this report we demonstrate that these two proteases can cleave proopiomelanocortin POMC in the secretory pathway of mammalian cells Similarly to pituitary corticotrophs PC3 expressed in processingdeficient BSC40 cells cleaved native mouse POMC at the LysArg sites flanking corticotropin The LysArg within betalipotropin was less efficiently cleaved to release betaendorphin Expression of PC2 together with PC3 resulted in efficient conversion of betalipotropin as occurs in pituitary melanotrophs Furthermore coexpression of PC2 together with mouse POMC in bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells resulted in conversion of betalipotropin to gammalipotropin and betaendorphin in the regulated secretory pathway Finally the processing selectivities of PC3 and PC2 expressed together in BSC40 cells were determined by using a series of mutant mouse POMCs containing all possible pairs of basic residues at certain sites The observed pattern of cleavage site selectivities mimicked that of the endogenous endoproteases of the insulinoma and bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells suggesting that PC2 and PC3 may represent important core endoproteases in the catalysis of prohormone processing in many neuroendocrine cell types
R285	The tissues from 16 cases of adenosquamous carcinoma pseudoglandular squamous cell carcinoma or adenoacanthoma of the sweat glands of Lever and 26 cases of invasive squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva were studied for the presence of human papillomavirus HPV genomes using Southern blot hybridization on fresh tissues Types 1 2 3 4 5 6 16 and 18 HPV DNA probes and in situ hybridization were used on formalinfixed paraffin sections using type 2 6 16 and 18 HPV DNA probes Only one case of adenosquamous carcinoma contained an undetermined type of HPV DNA whereas five cases of squamous cell carcinoma contained HPV DNA Three of these five cases contained type 16 one type 6 HPV and two an undetermined type These results demonstrate HPV DNA associations with malignancy of the vulva that are similar to those observed elsewhere in the genital tract
R286	All neonates n  581 with birth weights less than 1501 gm admitted to seven neonatal intensive care units in Wisconsin and Iowa were candidates for a study aimed at the multivariate assessment of risk factors for chronic lung disease while controlling for baseline severity of respiratory disease Data from 361 neonates were analyzed for all risk factors except fluids only neonates weighing less than 1200 gm were included n  220 Information on traditional risk factors for chronic lung disease was abstracted A total of 110 30 of the analyzed neonates were oxygen dependent on day 30 of life The following baseline factors were associated with increased risk of oxygen dependence in a joint multivariate model lower birth weight odds ratio 14100 gm higher baseline severity score odds ratio 27doubling at 32 weeks gestational age lower gestational age odds ratio 24week at severity 0 Apgar score at 1 minute odds ratio 162 points male gender odds ratio 19 and nonblack race odds ratio 22 After adjustment for all baseline factors patent ductus arteriosus ventilator pressure at 96 hours oxygen at 96 hours and fluid intake were associated with oxygen dependence Neonates with a low baseline severity score who remained oxygen dependent had a higher intake of fluid relative to output whereas neonates with a higher baseline severity score had higher fluid intake and output Lack of weight loss was associated with increased severity but not with oxygen dependence The results of this study generally confirm the significance of previously reported risk factors for chronic lung disease in a multivariate setting but show that risk factors may not have the same impact in neonates with different baseline severity
R287	Bowens disease has been reported as a skin marker for internal malignancy We conducted a matched casecontrol study to evaluate the significance of this link Fifty white men with Bowens disease diagnosed between 1977 and 1986 at a Veterans Administration Hospital were selected for study These patients were matched by age sex race and date of skin biopsy to 50 patients with basal cell carcinoma control group 1 and another 50 patients with other dermatoses control group 2 The original 50 patients with Bowens disease include 12 24 with various internal malignancies In comparison nine patients 18 in control group 1 and seven patients 14 in control group 2 had internal malignancies These numbers do not substantiate a statistically significant increase in the frequency of internal malignancies in Bowens disease We therefore conclude that Bowens disease is not a skin marker for internal malignancy in elderly white men
R288	A doubleblind multicenter trial compared rilmenidine with placebo in the treatment of 126 patients with mild to moderate hypertension after a 4week placebo runin period Patients with mild hypertension study 1 with mean supine diastolic blood pressure BP between 95 and 104 mm Hg received either rilmenidine 1 mgday n  31 or placebo n  35 for 4 weeks In study 2 patients with moderate hypertension mean supine diastolic BP between 105 and 115 mm Hg received either rilmenidine 1 mg twice a day n  30 or placebo twice a day n  30 for 4 weeks All 61 patients taking rilmenidine completed the study 8 of the 65 patients taking placebo were withdrawn because of an increase in BP Rilmenidine significantly reduced mean systolic and diastolic BP compared with placebo in both studies BP was normalized systolic less than 160 mm Hg and diastolic less than or equal to 90 mm Hg in 61 of the patients taking rilmenidine as opposed to 23 of those taking placebo p less than 0001 There was no significant difference in the incidence of either dry mouth or daytime drowsiness between rilmenidine 1 mgday and placebo Dry mouth was significantly more frequent with rilmenidine 2 mgday than with placebo but this difference was transient and no longer significant at the end of the study No unexpected adverse effects occurred Rilmenidine as single therapy appears to be effective and well accepted in the management of mild to moderate hypertension in particular at the 1mgday dose which normalized 84 of mild hypertensive patients and did not induce any significant adverse effects compared with placebo
R289	To investigate the prognostic factors in Western patients with hepatocellular carcinoma 206 patients with confirmed diagnoses of hepatocellular carcinoma were studied in terms of survival All patients were diagnosed between 1983 and 1987 A multivariate survival analysis Cox regression model using clinical biochemical ultrasonographical and pathological data obtained at diagnosis disclosed that bilirubin p  00001 ascites p  00001 toxic syndrome defined by the presence of weight loss greater than 10 premorbid weight malaise and anorexia p  0009 blood urea nitrogen p  0025 tumor size p  0001 gammaglutamyltranspeptidase p  00006 age p  00005 serum sodium p  0003 and presence of metastases p  0002 were independent predictors of survival According to the contribution of each of these factors to the final model a prognostic index was constructed allowing division of patients in different groups according to their relative risk of death RRD  EXP Age x 003  Ascites x 08281  BUN x 00137  Serum sodium x 00538  gammaGlutamyltranspeptidase x 00019  Bilirubin x 00734  Tumor size x 033  Toxic syndrome x 04965  Metastases x 055 These results facilitate the stratification of hepatocellular carcinoma patients to design and evaluate future controlled trials
R290	A doubleblind crossover study of sodium valproate and placebo was conducted in five patients with Meige syndrome CSF neurotransmitter studies were performed at the end of each treatment period GABA levels were not influenced by the administration of sodium valproate An increase in HVA levels was observed in every patient which may reflect an increase in central dopaminergic activity This finding may explain the trend towards clinical deterioration which was observed during treatment with sodium valproate Sodium valproate appears to be ineffective in Meige syndrome
R291	Gastric intramural pH pHi which has been shown to reflect the adequacy of oxygenation in peripheral tissue beds was measured in acutely ill surgical patients in order to evaluate its value as a prognostic factor and its relation to the sepsis score Fiftynine surgical patients were studied on ICU admission The stomach wall pH was calculated from the PCO2 in gastric juice and arterial bicarbonate concentration using the HendersonHasselbalch equation A fall in tissue pH less than 732 was taken as an indication of inadequate tissue oxygenation Patients with sepsis scores greater than 10 were considered septic Hospital and shortterm within 72 h of admission mortality rates were determined A significantly higher shortterm mortality rate was observed in patients having a pHi less than 732 37 vs 0 p less than 005 Most 90 of the septic patients had a pHi less than 732 The shortterm mortality rate was the highest 50 in the septic group In this group also a linear correlation was found between pHi and the sepsis score r  43 p less than 01 Gastric pHi however offered no prediction for the longterm outcome
R292	An unusual fetal heart rate pattern was detected intrapartum in a patient with an otherwise uncomplicated pregnancy An approach to the evaluation of the unusual fetal heart rate pattern was developed
R293	The antitumor compound ACNU 14amino2methyl5pyrimidinylmethyl32chloroethyl3nitroso ure a hydrochloride is widely used for treatment of malignant brain tumors The authors have investigated the mechanism of acquisition of ACNU resistance at the cellular level by isolating ACNUresistant mutants from V79 Chinese hamster cells and C6 rat glioma cells after treatment of the cells with ACNU or other alkylating agents In V79 Chinese hamster cells ACNU at 1 to 4 microgramsml caused dosedependent induction of drugresistant mutants to ACNU 10 microgramsml and 8azaguanine 20 microgramsml but not to ouabain 1 mM Values for the mean lethal dose of ACNUresistant mutants were 24 to 172 times those of the parent V79 cells The ACNUresistant phenotype was stable during an observation period of 13 weeks The ACNU seemed to have a specific effect in inducing ACNUresistant mutations because no ACNUresistant mutations were induced by treatment of the cells with other known mutagens such as NmethylNnitroNnitrosoguanidine methylmethanesulfonate and ethylmethanesulfonate The C6 rat glioma cells also showed a significant mutagenic response to ACNU producing ACNU and 5fluorouracilresistant mutants The present results have the important therapeutic and mechanistic implication that ACNU is a potent mutagen and induces mutants that are resistant to ACNU and to other drugs
R294	The bioavailability of oral cyclosporine CYS dissolved in a large quantity of milk given just before liver transplantation LTX was evaluated in 30 patients given randomly timed oral CYS before LTX by measurements of CYS blood levels at induction 2 h later and at the time of graft reperfusion Adequate blood CYS levels defined as greater than or equal to 500 ngmL FPIA could reliably be achieved only when the drug was administered 4 to 7 h preoperatively Patients receiving the drug less than 4 h preoperatively generally had low levels thereafter two of seven patients had greater than or equal to 500 ngmL in any sample compared with 13 of 14 patients in the 47h group P less than 0011 an interval of greater than 7 h yielded unpredictable results Fluids and blood products transfused and preoperative ascites or ICU care were not related to blood CYS levels Oral CYS should be given 4 to 7 h before LTX to achieve adequate levels
R295	STUDY OBJECTIVE Doseresponse evaluation of oral labetalol 100 200 or 300 mg on heart rate and systemic blood pressure in emergency department patients with hypertensive urgency diastolic blood pressure 110 to 140 mm Hg and no endorgan evidence of hypertensive emergency METHODS This acutetreatment doseranging study used a randomized doubleblind parallel design Patients with supine diastolic blood pressure of 110 to 140 mm Hg after 30 minutes of bedrest received an oral dose of labetalol Supine blood pressure and heart rate were measured manually and recorded hourly for four hours after dose Diastolic blood pressure of 100 mm Hg or less or a 30mm Hg reduction in diastolic blood pressure was considered a treatment success RESULTS Two hundred fiftyfive patients were evaluated for inclusion and 36 patients 19 women and 17 men mean age 44 years age range 23 to 67 years were studied The most frequent reason for exclusion was a spontaneous decrease in diastolic blood pressure to less than 110 mm Hg 31 with bedrest There were 12 patients in each treatment group Compared with baseline the 100mg dose significantly P less than 05 reduced heart rate at three and four hours after dose and the 300mg dose significantly P less than 05 reduced heart rate at one two and three hours after dose the 200mg dose did not significantly affect heart rate All doses produced a significant decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures at one two three and four hours after dose compared with baseline There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups with regard to systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate at baseline or one two three or four hours after dose At two hours after dose diastolic blood pressure control was observed in 75 58 and 67 of patients receiving 100 200 and 300 mg respectively P  903 At four hours after dose diastolic blood pressure control was observed in 50 64 and 67 of patients receiving 100 200 and 300 mg respectively P  755 A comparison of treatment success rates between the two time periods showed a waning of response with the 100mg dose of labetalol at hour 4 compared with hour 2 P less than 05 No adverse effects were observed CONCLUSION Labetalol provides safe and effective treatment for hypertensive urgencies when administered orally in doses of 100 to 300 mg
R296	In summary this is a patient who presented with respiratory acidosis and cor pulmonale The major diagnostic challenge was in differentiating primary cardiopulmonary disease from a central abnormality of ventilatory drive The arterial blood gases showed a normal Aa gradient suggesting hypoventilation as the etiology of his hypoxemia Pulmonary function testing showed air trapping but a relatively normal FEV1FVC and airways resistance The literature suggests that most altitude natives have depressed hypoxemic and hypercapnic drives with a distinct subset demonstrating a profoundly depressed drive to ventilation This latter group has been labeled as having chronic mountain sickness or Monges disease As one might expect ventilatory control during sleep is also abnormal in these patients with CMS Our patient indeed showed typical frequent severe desaturations with hypopnea The diagnosis of CMS in our patient was made with routine arterial blood gases and standard pulmonary function tests Additional tests of ventilatory responsiveness to oxygen and carbon dioxide could have been performed but are not necessary to make the diagnosis
R297	The purpose of the present study was to determine whether early removal of an experimental intracerebral mass altered cerebral blood flow brain water content neuropathological findings or neurological function 24 hours later In three experimental series a 50microliter balloon was inflated within the right caudate nucleus in rats At 24 hours after inflation we studied cerebral blood flow by quantitative autoradiography brain specific gravity and qualitative histopathology by light microscopy The animals were also assessed using a simple neurological deficit scale In each series half of the animals had the balloon inflated for 10 minutes Group 1 and half had the balloon inflated permanently Group 2 After transient inflation there were surprisingly small differences in the blood flow between the two cerebral hemispheres at 24 hours By contrast in animals with permanent inflation several indices of blood flow were significantly worse in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the balloon the mean and median blood flow levels in the caudate nucleus the mean blood flow in the cerebral cortex and the area of cortex with ischemic levels of blood flow The specific gravity was reduced in areas surrounding the site of balloon insertion after either transient or permanent inflation and there was evidence of ischemic cell damage in all animals studied These changes were more severe after permanent inflation but the differences were not significant Neurological outcome was significantly better after transient as compared with permanent inflation The present findings contradict previous results and suggest that early removal of an intracerebral mass may have subsequent benefits
R298	We report a large spectrum of histological muscle abnormalities in 50 homosexual men with AIDS and ARC We encountered motheaten fibers in 76 angulated fibers in 76 type groupings in 62 type 2 fiber atrophy in 58 mononuclear endomysial andor perimysial andor perivascular infiltrates in 36 necrosis and phagocytosis in 30 and target fibers in 6 Two patients showed vasculitis and two others showed perifascicular atrophy On the whole 96 of the biopsies showed substantial abnormalities Muscle involvement in AIDS seems more common than previously suspected
R299	Chest radiographs that are correctly obtained and interpreted provide valuable diagnostic information However some radiographs are not taken at total lung capacity and the appearance of the lungs on film may mimic certain lung disorders Most common interpretive pitfalls in chest radiography can be avoided by physicians who are familiar with the film appearance of varying degrees of lung inflation technical limitations of portable radiography and common chest abnormalities When further definition is necessary additional projections should be obtained Chest fluoroscopy and computed tomography can offer further clarification if needed
R300	The migration of lymphocytes from the bloodstream into the secondary lymphoid organs which is necessary for a successful immune response occurs primarily within postcapillary venules that are characterized by highwalled endothelial cells Lymphocyte adhesion to and extravasation at these sites is associated with the expression of specific lymphoid receptors for this specialized venule endothelium We report here the molecular cloning from a baboon lymphoid cell line of a cDNA that encodes an adhesion receptor for HEV The 362amino acid protein encoded by this cDNA is not present in any of the data bases examined The mature protein resulting from the cleavage of a putative 20amino acid signal peptide has a calculated molecular mass of only 37 kDa indicating that the 90kDa cell surface protein is highly modified The 342 amino acids which lack any repeated sequences of significant length encompass an extracellular domain 250 amino acids a putative transmembrane domain 20 amino acids and a cytoplasmic domain 72 amino acids
R301	The influence of interferongamma IFNgamma on immune responses is still ambiguous We have investigated whether IFNgamma influences the constitutive interleukin1 IL1like activity in normal rat skin because IL1 is a regulatory cytokine in immune responses Rats were injected intradermally into both ears with different doses of rat recombinant IFNgamma 103105 U and control animals were given phosphatebuffered saline PBS The animals were killed at different times and the ears were cut off at the bases The biologic activity of the IFNgamma was verified by immunohistochemistry on injected ears showing a time and dosedependent induction of major histocompatibility complex class II antigens on the keratinocytes Aqueous extracts of homogenized ear skin were tested for IL1like activity in a mouse thymocyte bioassay No major effects of IFNgamma on the constitutive IL1like activity in the rat skin were found at 6 h there was a slight reduction and at 72 h an increase in IL1 bioactivity in extracts from IFNgamma 105 Uinjected animals compared with PBStreated controls p less than 005 We conclude that the regulation of immune responses in the rat skin by IFNgamma is less likely to be mediated via changes in the IL1like activity
R302	We examined the influence of diabetes on the severity of coronary atherosclerosis as judged by coronary morphometric and blood flow studies Cynomolgus monkeys were fed a coconutpeanut oil mixture plus cholesterol to induce the plaque lesions of atherosclerosis in nondiabetic group 2 and diabetic monkeys group 3 Group 1 consisted of chowfed controls After 18 months of hypercholesterolemia the animals were anesthetized to assess myocardial blood flow by use of radioactive microspheres Transmural and innerouter wall flow ratios were normal in the two lipidfed groups in the basal state Vasodilation after adenosine 045 mgkgmin IV elicited a more than threefold rise of transmural blood flow in group 1 and a significantly reduced increment in groups 2 and 3 The blood flow ratio was not different from unity in group 1 but declined to 069  003 in group 2 and 069  006 in group 3 with similar decrements of heart rate and aortic pressure In contrast to results in group 1 left ventricular filling pressure rose and velocity of contractile elements declined to a similar extent in groups 2 and 3 after adenosine consistent with myocardial ischemia Morphometric measurements as well as chemical analyses were performed on the three major coronary arteries The degree of intimal thickening and increase of cholesterol and collagen content were comparable in groups 2 and 3 Thus in this model the plaque lesions of atherosclerosis did not appear to be intensified by diabetes Moreover the responses to adenosine in terms of myocardial underperfusion and mechanical dysfunction were comparable in the two experimental groups
R303	Selective embolization of thrombotic material to the borderzone territories between major cerebral arteries was found to be the cause of watershed cerebral infarction in three reported cases The embolic source was cardiac in two cases and carotid artery in one The findings in these cases support the hypothesis that small thromboemboli may not be randomly distributed in the cerebral arterial supply but may be preferentially distributed to the small terminal arterial branches in the borderzones between major arterial territories Previous reports of this phenomenon laid emphasis on the sharp angle at which small penetrating arteries branched from parent arteries as the mechanism underlying this preferential distribution We propose that the unequal size of the branches at the majority of bifurcations of subarachnoid arteries is a more important anatomic feature leading to this pattern of infarction
R304	In 1985 a 5year multicenter Veterans Administration Cooperative Study was completed that compared the efficacy and toxicity of phenobarbital carbamazepine phenytoin and primidone in a doubleblind prospective study design A total of 622 patients either previously untreated or undertreated were entered into the study Strict exclusion criteria limited confounding factors such as drug or alcohol abuse Results showed that each of the four drugs used as monotherapy were similarly effective in the treatment of generalized tonic clonic seizures but carbamazepine was significantly more effective in the treatment of complex partial seizures as measured by 100 control When the results for all four drugs were combined the data showed that approximately 80 of the patients were adequately managed on monotherapy Differences in toxicity were the most significant factor that discriminated between these four drugs Both carbamazepine and phenytoin were associated with significantly lower incidences of intolerable side effects than were primidone or phenobarbital A behavioral toxicity battery was performed whenever possible prior to administration of any antiepileptic drug and at 1 3 6 and 12 months after initiation of monotherapy Significant differences in performance on all subtests of the battery were found between patients with epilepsy and a control group matched by age sex and education When the differential effects of all four drugs on behavioral toxicity were compared few statistically significant differences emerged However carbamazepine consistently produced fewer adverse effects on tests of attentionconcentration and motor performance than did the other three antiepileptic drugs
R305	A technique is described for investigating the internal structure of the prostate gland including calcification by projection Xray microscopy microradiography The results show that the technique can be used in conjunction with the corresponding histological preparations to complement the examination of the prostate gland by demonstrating tissue density and the structure and location of microcalcification less than 5 microns in diameter
R306	We present a comparative study of calorimetrically derived thermodynamic profiles for the binding of a series of drugs with selected DNA host duplexes We use these data to demonstrate that comparisons between complete thermodynamic profiles delta G zero delta H zero delta S zero delta Cp are required before drug binding can be used as a probe of DNA conformation since enthalpyentropy compensations can cause two drugDNA binding events to exhibit similar binding free energies delta G zero despite being driven by entirely different thermodynamic forces delta H zero delta S zero In this work we employ a combination of spectroscopic and calorimetric techniques to characterize thermodynamically the DNA binding of netropsin and distamycin two minor groovedirected ligands ethidium an intercalator and daunomycin a combined intercalatorgroove binder Our free energy data delta G zero show that each drug exhibits similar binding affinities at 25 degrees C for the alternating copolymer duplex polydATpolydAT and for the homopolymer duplex polydApolydT However our calorimetric measurements reveal that the nature of the thermodynamic forces delta H zero delta S zero that drive drug binding to these two host duplexes at 25 degrees C are entirely different despite similar binding free energies delta G zero and similar salt dependencies lnKlnNa Specifically the 25 degrees C binding of all four drugs to the alternating copolymer polydATpolydAT is overwhelmingly enthalpy driven whereas the corresponding binding of each drug to the homopolymer duplex polydApolydT is overwhelmingly entropy driven Thus the similar binding free energies delta G zero we measure for complexation of each drug with polydATpolydAT and polydApolydT result from compensating changes in the enthalpy and entropy terms Comparison with the thermodynamic profiles for the complexation of these drug molecules to other DNA host duplexes at 25 degrees C reveals that the binding of each is strongly enthalpy driven except when the polydApolydT homopolymer serves as the host duplex This comparison allows us to conclude that polydATpolydAT behaves thermodynamically as the more normal host duplex toward drug binding whereas the entropydriven binding to the polydApolydT duplex represents aberrant behaviorABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS
R307	In vitro sulfation of mucus glycoprotein by sulfotransferase from rat submandibular salivary gland and the effect of ethanol on this enzyme activity was investigated Subcellular fractionation studies revealed that the enzyme which catalyzes the transfer of sulfate ester group from 3phosphoadenosine5phosphosulfate to submandibular gland mucus glycoprotein is associated with Golgirich membrane fraction The sulfotransferase enzyme exhibited optimum activity at pH 68 in the presence of 05 Triton X100 4 mM MgCl2 and 25 mM NaF The enzyme was equally capable of sulfation of the desulfated intact as well as proteolytically degraded desulfated glycoprotein preparations whereas the acceptor capacity of the intact mucus glycoprotein was 70 lower The submandibular gland sulfotransferase activity was inhibited by ethanol The rate of inhibition of mucus glycoprotein sulfation was proportional to the concentration of ethanol up to 04 M at which concentration a 39 reduction in the sulfotransferase activity occurred The apparent Km value of the enzyme for salivary mucus glycoprotein was 111 microM and the Kl in the presence of ethanol was 093 M The synthesized 35Slabeled glycoprotein gave on CsCl equilibrium density gradient centrifugation 35Slabeled peak which coincided with that of the glycoprotein Alkaline borohydride treatment of this glycoprotein led to the liberation of the label into the acidic oligosaccharide alditol fraction As the inhibition by ethanol of sulfotransferase enzyme occurred below its isosmotic concentration to plasma the observed effect could also be detrimental to salivary mucus glycoprotein sulfation in vivo
R308	Evidence that lowering blood cholesterol levels reduces risk of coronary heart disease has prompted widespread recommendations that hyperlipidemic individuals undergo dietary therapy However the extent to which people can adopt and maintain diets to lower lipids is unclear In our article we review what is currently known regarding adherence to lowfat diets and present an approach to dietary counseling for lowering cholesterol that incorporates elements of behavioral selfmanagement and social learning theory We discuss specific recommendations for counseling hyperlipidemic patients based on the Dietary Alternatives Study Recommendations include providing patients with an adequate knowledge base to make dietary changes using goal setting and selfmonitoring to help patients initiate dietary changes enlisting support from the patients family and enhancing selfefficacy to promote longterm dietary maintenance
R309	Seventeen previously untreated boys with haemophilia A were treated with high purity heat treated factor VIII concentrate 8Y for up to 36 months Liver function tests were assessed monthly No boys serum has been shown to contain HIV antibodies and no increases in alanine transaminase activity have been detected In only one patient was a single rise in aspartate transaminase activity noted and this was without a corresponding rise in alanine transaminase A second patients serum contained hepatitis B core antibody transiently It was thought likely in both cases that the abnormalities reflected intercurrent infections rather than disease associated with transfusion The physical treatments used in the production of 8Y seem to inactivate the agents responsible for nonA nonB hepatitis and HIV transmission by transfusion of factor VIII has been abolished There are however problems associated with conducting safety trials in young haemophiliac patients
R310	Granulocyte PMN concentrates collected for transfusion to septic neutropenic patients are stored in the blood bank for various periods of time before they are given Current methods of blood bank storage of PMN concentrates are associated with impaired in vitro PMN chemotaxis CTX and in vivo recovery and circulation kinetics after 24 hours of storage This suggested the possibility that PMN may become hyperadherent during storage To test this hypothesis PMN concentrates were harvested and stored at both 22 and 6 degrees C and their adherence properties to relevant biologic surfaces endothelial cell EC monolayers and extracellular matrix ECM derived from endothelium were measured Adherence was measured within 4 hours of collection and after 24 and 48 hours of storage The aggregation properties of fresh and stored PMN were also studied The adherence of fresh unstimulated PMN to EC and ECM 31  5 and 34  4 respectively increased significantly after storage for 24 hours EC  41  8 ECM  43  4 at 22 degrees C FMetLeuPhe FMLP stimulated the adherence of fresh PMN EC  37  4 ECM  42  4 p less than 005 The adherence of PMN stored at 22 degrees C was further stimulated by FMLP EC  46  6 ECM  50  4 PMN stored at 6 degrees C had significantly higher adherence than PMN stored at 22 degrees C and the percentage of increase in adherence induced by FMLP was attenuated in PMN stored at 6 degrees CABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R311	We have developed an assay to study the effect of drugs on the proliferation of neonatal human skinderived keratinocytes in vitro Expanding populations of neonatal keratinocytes were cultured in low concentrations 05 of fetal calf serum for up to 12 d Growth of the cultures was determined by measurement of DNA using a sensitive fluorimetric assay Addition of 109106 M 12RShydroxy581014eicosatetraenoic acid 12RSHETE neither stimulated keratinocyte proliferation nor enhanced the incorporation of 3Hthymidine The ability of neonatal keratinocytes in low serum medium to respond to exogenous factors was demonstrated by increased growth in response to a mixture of cholera toxin hydrocortisone and epidermal growth factor Confluent keratinocyte cultures in 10 human AB serum exposed to 12SHETE for 72 h also showed no changes in DNA 3Hthymidine incorporation or labeling index Metabolism of 12S3HHETE was greater in cultures containing low concentrations of serum but there was no evidence for the formation of 1220dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid
R312	Prevalence studies carried out in Sardinia from 1975 suggest an increasing occurrence of MS However it is questionable whether this increase represents a real change in MS incidence or simply reflects longer survival Data from 79 patients indicated the average annual incidence for the period 1965 through 1985 was 34 per 100000 On December 31 1985 the prevalence rate was 69 per 100000 Evaluation of MS temporal trends showed a significant increase in MS incidence during the study period values ranged around two per 100000 in the triennial periods 19651967 19681970 and 19711973 and around five in each triennium from 1977 onward
R313	Supernatants of mitogenstimulated human leukocytes contain two biologically related cytokines IL1 and hybridoma growth factor HGF IL1 beta is a potent inducer of HGF in fibroblasts but has little stimulating effect on monocytes that spontaneously produce HGF Leukocytederived HGF and IL1 were separated by the use of affinity chromatography on specific antibodies and discriminating assay systems for both cytokines They had different Mr upon gel filtration and SDSPAGE In contrast to IL1 beta HGF showed heterogeneity on a cationexchange column IL1 beta and HGF were purified to homogeneity by a sequence of four and five purification steps respectively Leukocytederived HGF was characterized by analysis of its NH2terminal amino acid sequence This revealed complete homology with fibroblastderived HGF 26kDa protein IFNbeta 2 and B cell stimulatory factor 2 molecules which have collectively been designated as IL6 IL1 beta exerted an antiviral and growthpromoting effect of fibroblasts whereas HGFIL6 did not Both IL1 and IL6 possessed lymphocyteactivating factor activity which could be neutralized only by an antiserum against the corresponding cytokine
R314	The herpes simplex virus HSV recombinant R7017 was constructed from HSV1 strain F by deleting a portion of the thymidine kinase tk gene and by replacing the sequences representing the internal inverted repeats and adjacent genes in the L component with a fragment of the HSV2 genome encoding the glycoproteins G D I and a portion of E In addition the R7020 recombinant contains an HSV1 DNA fragment encoding the tk gene fused to the alpha 4 gene promoter The results of studies in mice guinea pigs and rabbits were as follows Both recombinants remained unchanged after nine serial intracerebral passages in mice the recombinants could not be differentiated with respect to attenuation in mice injected intracerebrally in vaginally infected guinea pigs and in rabbits inoculated on the scarified cornea Given intradermally or intramuscularly the recombinants prevented severe infections by virulent challenge viruses and R7020 established latent infections at a low frequency in all species tested whereas latent R7017 virus was detected in rabbits only
R315	The authors report 88 cases of ovarian carcinoma containing areas of transitional cell carcinoma TCC The tumors were found in women 2876 years old mean 51 years Fifteen patients presented with stage II 59 with stage III and 14 with stage IV disease Ten neoplasms were composed of only TCC 48 were predominantly TCC and 30 had foci of TCC but the predominant component was serous endometrioid undifferentiated or unclassified adenocarcinoma After the primary resection of the neoplasm 76 patients received chemotherapy 4 received chemotherapy and radiotherapy and 5 received radiotherapy only 2 refused further treatment and 1 patient died immediately after the first operation Estimated fiveyear survival rates were 37 for the entire group and 41 for those who received chemotherapy Favorable prognostic indicators statistically significant were low clinical stage predominant TCC in the primary tumor and a negative secondlook operation Other prognostic indicators were the amount of residual tumor after the first operation and tumor differentiation When the primary neoplasm was predominantly TCC another prognostic indicator was the type of carcinoma present in the metastases Fiveyear followup shows that 56 of the patients whose metastases were predominantly TCC have no evidence of disease whereas only 7 of the patients whose metastases are predominantly nonTCC are diseasefree The authors study indicates that ovarian carcinomas containing predominant TCC pattern have an excellent response to different chemotherapy regimens Tumor recurrences and lack of response to chemotherapy are often associated with a change in the histologic appearance of the metastatic lesion
R316	This study had three major goals 1 to vigorously verify the presence of progesterone receptors in squamous cell carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract HNSCC Antiprogesterone receptor monoclonal antibodies revealed a distinct band at approximately 120 kilodaltons in samples taken from two of four patients with HNSCC These results illustrate that progesterone receptor in HNSCC has the same molecular weight as progesterone receptor in normal human uterus and human breast cancer Steroid specificity and saturability results support the evidence that it is true progesterone receptors that are measured and not other receptors or sex steroidbinding globulins 2 to confirm the biochemical function of progesterone receptors in HNSCC by assessing the binding of progesterone receptor to acceptor sites on chromosomes in the nucleus and 3 to establish the clinical significance of progesterone receptor measurement Patients with positive assays were more likely to be free of disease a mean of 6 months after resection We used logistic regression to account for site of primary disease grade of tumor and stage of disease This logistic regression was significant with a p  0014 Patients with a binding index greater than 2 19 of 73 patients were 434 times more likely to be free of disease than patients with negative assays
R317	During cervical differentiation in 1 to 6monthold rabbits a marked increase was observed in the titer of serum estradiol the number of secretory cells in the endocervix and the granule content of these cells Because these secretory granules are rich in carbohydrates it seemed likely that hormones regulate glycoconjugate biosynthesis in the endocervix To investigate this possibility the synthesis of O and Nlinked glycoproteins was studied in cellfree preparations from endocervical epithelium The activity of Nacetylgalactosaminyl GalNAc transferase the first enzyme in the pathway for Olinked oligosaccharide chain biosynthesis measured in microsomes prepared from the developing cervix was increased 8fold Oligosaccharyltransferase the enzyme that catalyzes the first step in the attachment of Nlinked oligosaccharide chains to proteins was measured in microsomes prepared under the same conditions as those used for GalNAc transferase The results of two independent assay methods revealed an estrogendependent 10 to 15fold increase in oligosaccharyltransferase during cervical differentiation Consistent with these developmental effects ovariectomy of adult rabbits resulted in reduced P less than 001 titers of serum estradiol and a 2fold reduction in the specific activity of GalNAc transferase When animals were treated with exogenous estradiol GalNAc transferase activity returned to estrous control levels The antagonistic action of progesterone on GalNAc transferase activity was verified using endocervical membranes from pseudopregnant animals Similarly oligosaccharyltransferase activity was reduced 2 to 3fold when estrous animals were ovariectomized or made pseudopregnant The treatment of ovariectomized animals with estradiol resulted in the restoration of oligosaccharyltransferase to estrous control values Collectively these results provide the first definitive evidence that hormones can regulate the activity of the enzymes involved in the attachment of O and Nlinked oligosaccharide chains to proteins in the endocervix
R318	In some patients with chronic atrial fibrillation treatment with digitalis alone may fail to produce a satisfactory decrease in heart rate at rest or during exercise or emotional stress Findings of a few clinical studies suggest that beta blockade in combination with digitalis therapy may be of benefit in these patients In a randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled parallelgroup 8week study of 32 patients with chronic atrial fibrillation the effects of digoxin therapy alone were compared with a combination of digoxin and nadolol Criteria for entry into the study included ventricular rate at rest greater than or equal to 80min or greater than or equal to 120min with exercise and serum digoxin levels within the therapeutic range After digoxin dose titration to produce therapeutic levels digoxin dosage remained constant throughout the balance of the study After a 2week singleblind placebo leadin period patients were randomized to receive either digoxin plus placebo or a combination of digoxin and nadolol The dose of nadololplacebo was titrated from 20 to 120 mg daily as tolerated Twentyfour hour ambulatory electrocardiographic Holter recordings symptomlimited exercise treadmill tests and serum digoxin and nadolol levels were obtained at the end of the single and doubleblind treatment periods Comparing endpoint with baseline results from Holter recordings showed that patients treated with a combination of digoxin and nadolol had significant p less than 0001 decreases in 24 hour average 78  4 to 63  3ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R319	This method is easily applied and useful for the estimation of the actual length of the gastric tube in situations of reconstruction after subtotal esophagectomy The actual length of the gastric tube was almost identical to that of the stomach which was measured from the preoperative roentgenogram In the end a safe reconstruction by this approach will decrease the operative mortality rate caused by the leakage of the anastomosis
R320	This study tested the hypothesis that rapidly expanded random pattern skin flaps demonstrate enhanced resistance to bacterial invasion from intradermal injection of Staphylococcus aureus in a porcine model Sites for a 6 X 12 cm expanded a 6 X 9 cm shamexpanded and a 6 X 6 cm acute random pattern skin flap were outlined but not elevated on the backs of 14 white pigs A 450cc tissue expander inserted beneath the panniculus carnosus at the site for expansion was sequentially filled to the limits of skin viability each day for 5 days At the sham site a tissue expander was similarly inserted but left unexpanded the acute flap site was left undisturbed On day 8 flaps were elevated immediately sutured in place and 01 ml of saline solution containing 107 Staphylococcus aureus inoculated intradermally at four corresponding sites in each flap and at three sites in normal skin In seven animals these sites were at the proximal base of the flaps in seven others the sites were distal The resulting areas of erythema and skin ulceration were measured on each of the next 3 days and the measurements compared At corresponding proximal sites the mean area of erythema and ulceration measured over the next 3 days in expanded flaps 312 mm2 and in shamexpanded flaps 338 mm2 was significantly less than in acute flaps and control skin 475 mm2 434 mm2 p less than 005 Measurements in the rapidly expanded flaps were not significantly different than those in the shamoperated expanded flapsABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS

R322	dTubocurarine dTc was administered intravenously to six healthy unanesthetized volunteers to assess the sensitivity to neuromuscular blockade of those muscles involved in protecting the airway against obstruction andor aspiration relative to the muscles of inspiration Each subject was given an intravenous bolus of dTc followed by an infusion to allow three different levels of inspiratory muscle weakness as measured by maximum inspiratory pressure MIP Levels of MIP were control 90 cm H2O 60 40 and 20 cm H2O Vital capacity VC hand grip strength HGS and endtidal CO2 PETCO2 were obtained at each level At each level of weakness and at intermediate values during recovery muscles of airway protection were functionally assessed by noting the MIP at which the maneuver could be accomplished and the MIP at which they could not The mean of these two values was calculated for each subject The tests were 1 ability to swallow 2 ability to perform a valsalva maneuver 3 prevent obstruction of the airway and 4 ability to approximate teeth These were compared with head lift and straight leg raising At maximum neuromuscular blockade MIP of 20 cm H2O VC was 20 liters HGs was 0 and PETCO2 was normal Muscles of airway protection were still incapacitated Swallowing returned above MIP of 43 cm H2O approximation of teeth above 42 cm H2O airway obstruction above 39 cm H2O and valsalva above 33 cm H2O Thus although ventilation may be adequate at MIP  25 mmHg the muscles of airway protection are still nonfunctionalABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R323	Larginine is required for the fungistatic action of murine macrophages in vitro To further investigate this requirement Larginine metabolism by macrophages was measured under conditions where fungistasis either succeeded or failed Macrophage fungistasis correlated with metabolism of Larginine to citrulline nitrite and nitrate The metabolic rate was dependent on extracellular Larginine concentration reaching a maximum of 67 nmol nitriteh per mg protein It accounted for onethird of arginine consumed by fungistatic macrophages Equimolar amounts of citrulline and total nitrite plus nitrate accumulated in medium This was consistent with the hypothesis that one of the equivalent guanidino nitrogens of Larginine was oxidized to both nitrite and nitrate leaving Lcitrulline as the amino acid reaction product The analogue NGmonomethylLarginine selectively inhibited nitrogen oxidation and it was shown previously that it inhibited fungistatic capability Resident macrophages were not fungistatic and their nitrogen oxidation was low Once macrophages began producing nitritenitrate protein synthesis was not required during the next 8 h for either fungistasis or nitrogen oxidation Twothirds of Larginine consumption was due to macrophage arginase yielding Lornithine and urea which accumulated in medium This activity was dissociated from macrophage fungistasis Nitrogen oxidation metabolism by macrophages is linked to a mechanism that inhibits proliferation of fungi This may involve synthesis of an intermediate compounds that has antimicrobial properties
R324	The insulin release in response to glucose was studied in perifused isletlike cell clusters ICCs obtained from human fetal or neonatal pancreases at various stages of development 1215 gestational wk n  7 1720 wk n  13 225 wk n  2 1 diabetic pregnancy and 2644 wk n  6 postnatal samples The ICCs were stimulated with 20 mM glucose and subsequently with 10 mM theophylline plus 20 mM glucose as a viability test Insulin release increased to a detectable level greater than 01 pgICC1min1 during glucose stimulation in four of seven of the youngest fetuses At 1720 wk the basal rate of insulin release had increased by at least 15fold above the detection limit 15 pgICC1min1 and glucose promoted a sustained monophasic response that was on the average 16fold higher than the basal level The response was significant P less than 05 in 9 of 13 experiments With postnatal ICC gestational age 2644 wk an earlyphase peak response was observed in 5 of 6 experiments The mean rates of insulin release after 512 min of glucose stimulation were 48 pgICC1min1 in newborn infants and 21 pgICC1min1 in 17 to 20wk fetuses The corresponding mean relative insulin responses stimulated to basal were 33fold range 1175 and 16fold 1034 respectively P less than 05 MannWhitney U test The results suggest that the human fetal pancreas is already responsive to glucose during the first half of gestation but the biphasic insulin release does not start to mature until the postnatal phase
R325	In cases of exposure to unknown substances analyzing environmental or biological samples for elevated levels of toxicants can be extremely complex We assessed a method for prioritizing toxic substances according to the agreement between toxicspecific and incidentreported signs and symptoms by analyzing 25 reported case histories of exposure to inorganic toxicants In all but one case this analysis scheme successfully prioritized toxicants for subsequent analysis Despite its limitations the scheme is a substantial improvement over other available methods
R326	Encephalitis and polyneuritis occurring after rabies vaccination are believed to be immunologically mediated We studied antibody responses to neural antigens in 36 patients with major neurologic complications 25 with minor complications and 39 with no complications after immunization with a brainderived Semple rabies vaccine Patients with major complications had significantly elevated levels of antibody to brain white matter as compared with the other groups P less than 0001 Assays for antibody to selected central nervous system antigens showed that high levels of serum and cerebrospinal fluid antibody to myelin basic protein correlated with the presence of major neurologic complications both central and peripheral nervous systems The level of antibody to cerebroside correlated best with the number of injections of vaccine but like antibody to myelin basic protein the antibody to cerebroside was present in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with major complications Some patients with major complications also had antibodies directed to the gangliosides GD1b and GT1b No antibodies to myelinassociated glycoprotein were detected in any of the samples These data implicate myelin basic protein as an encephalitogen in these autoimmune diseases of the human nervous system but suggest that immune responses to cerebroside and certain gangliosides may have an augmentative role in severe disease
R327	Close platelettoplatelet contact induced by weak agonists in a medium with a low concentration of Ca2 leads to thromboxane A2 TXA2 formation release of granule contents and secondary aggregation These responses do not occur in a medium containing Ca2 in the physiological range 1 to 2 mmolL Experiments were done to determine whether feedback amplification is required to generate amounts of TXA2 that are sufficient to cause secondary aggregation and the reactions associated with it or whether close platelettoplatelet contact alone is sufficient to generate enough TXA2 to produce these responses Platelets were washed and resuspended in a modified Tyrode solution to which no calcium salt was added that contained 035 albumin and apyrase This medium contains 20 mumolL Ca2 and 1 mmolL Mg2 Platelets were aggregated with adenosine diphosphate ADP in the presence of fibrinogen agglutinated with polylysine or after pretreatment with chymotrypsin aggregated with fibrinogen In the lowCa2 medium all these agonists caused platelets to adhere to each other followed by secondary aggregation with TXA2 formation and release of granule contents When Ca2 1 to 2 mmolL aspirin or the thromboxane receptor blocker BM 13177 was present the secondary responses did not occur dazoxiben decreased thromboxane formation but did not prevent secondary aggregation or release Aspirintreated platelets were less responsive to ADP U46619 or TXA2 in the lowCa2 medium which indicated that the secondary responses of untreated platelets were not caused by a generalized increase in sensitivity The reactions that result from close platelettoplatelet contact in a lowCa2 medium can be caused by a wide variety of weak agonists the secondary aggregation response and release of granule contents are dependent on TXA2 formation and on feedback amplification by TXA2 or the prostaglandin endoperoxides The secondary responses caused by weak agonists in citrated plateletrich plasma which has a concentration of Ca2 similar to the lowCa2 medium used in the present studies do not occur at the concentration of Ca2 in circulating blood and thus may have little biologic relevance
R328	Apnea and worsening bronchopulmonary dysplasia as well as recurrent aspiration pneumonia have been found to be consequences of gastroesophageal reflux in infants and young children Antireflux procedures are effective in preventing gastroesophageal reflux however the effect of this operation on the course of these respiratory problems in very young patients is not known We reviewed the results in 51 patients 2 years of age or less who underwent an antireflux fundoplication for pulmonary problems attributable to severe gastroesophageal reflux unresponsive to medical treatment Twentyeight patients had recurrent episodes of aspiration pneumonia 14 had nonimproving or worsening bronchopulmonary dysplasia and 9 had unexplained apneic episodes Seventythree percent of these patients had coexisting congenital anomalies or acquired problems No operative deaths and no major surgical complications occurred There were eight late deaths occurring between 1 and 25 months postoperatively three were due to associated congenital anomalies or acquired problems three to sepsis and two to sudden infant death syndrome Of the 43 surviving children 91 percent with preoperative recurrent aspiration pneumonia had no additional episodes after Nissen procedure Eightyeight percent of the infants with unexplained apneic episodes showed marked benefit and 83 percent of those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia had clinical improvement There were no late problems attributed to the operation even when it was performed in preterm infants Therefore we recommend fundoplication for patients 2 years of age or less who have a persistent pulmonary problem attributed to gastroesophageal reflux that does not respond to medical therapy
R329	Nine monolayer cell cultures of glandular epithelium from gestational endometrium were established from six apparently healthy women undergoing elective termination of pregnancy 711 weeks gestation Radiolabel incorporation studies showed increasing incorporation of 35Smethionine into proteins present in supernatant and cytosol fractions over 48 h The secreted proteins represented approximately 20 of the total incorporation of methionine into cytosolic proteins De novo synthesis and secretion of placental protein14 PP14 and not PP12 was identified by a novel combination of line immunoelectrophoresis and autoradiography All monolayer cultures demonstrated the presence of radiolabeled PP14 but not PP12 in the culture supernatants These observations suggest that the glandular epithelial cells are the major site of synthesis and secretion of PP14 in human gestational endometrium
R330	Treating chronic arterial occlusive disease with heparin is controversial because of the risks associated with longterm anticoagulant therapy Low molecular weight LMW heparin mw about 5000 Dalton which selectively inhibits the Xa factor with minimal risk of hemorrhage seems to offer new possibilities in the prevention and treatment of both venous and acute arterial thromboembolism Therefore 44 patients with intermittent claudication were recruited to a randomized doubleblind controlled study Twentytwo were treated for six months with a single daily subcutaneous dose 15000 UaXa of LMW heparin and 22 with placebo administered in the same way over the same period of time After six months LMW heparin treatment not only improved walking capacity by lengthening the painfree walking time by 25 but also significantly modified the hemorrheologic pattern by reducing fibrinogen concentrations and whole blood viscosity at low shear rates LMW heparin also exerted an antithrombotic and profibrinolytic effect by significantly increasing both the antiXa factor and plasminogen activity without markedly modifying activated partial thromboplastin time 20 No LMW heparintreated patient hemorrhaged or reported other noteworthy side effects These results suggest LMW heparin might be a useful drug in the longterm treatment of chronic arterial occlusive disease of the limbs
R331	We retrospectively studied all patients who had normal coronary angiograms at The Methodist Hospital during the year 1984 8 of all angiograms Patients were surveyed eight to 18 months after angiography Of the 216 patients 83 of total sample 130 were female and 86 male Sixtythree percent of the women and 50 of the men satisfied the criteria for generalized anxiety disorder and 20 satisfied the criteria for panic attacks On the Brief Symptom Inventory BSI Somatization Scale 64 had scores above the average reported for psychiatric outpatients Eightyone percent received only reassurance about the absence of heart disease and 25 received continuing nitrate therapy in the absence of heart disease A majority of these patients remain untreated functional cardiac neurotics with untreated anxiety symptoms We make suggestions regarding a clinical profile to identify these patients and appropriate measures to avoid prolonged disability
R332	Glomerular Tlymphocyte infiltration has recently been demonstrated to precede glomerular macrophage influx in a preimmunized model of antiglomerular basementmembrane antibodyinduced glomerulonephritis antiGBMGN In the current study the functional role of these glomerular Tlymphocytes in directing macrophage localization was sought by measuring their production of macrophage migration inhibition factor MIF MIF activity in supernatants from cultured isolated glomeruli was measured in a conventional capillary tube bioassay Glomerular Tlymphocytes OX19 positive cells were maximal 195  019 cellsglomerular cross section cgcs 24 hours after injection of antiGBM antibody into sensitized animals Seventytwo hours after antibody injection Tlymphocyte numbers were reduced 102  014 cgcs while macrophage accumulation was maximal at 24 hrs 42  13 macrophagesglomerulus mg at 72 hrs 198  37 mg MIF activity was only detected in supernatants from Tlymphocyte infiltrated glomeruli 12 hrs 4081  432 migration inhibition 24 hrs 4511  411 migration inhibition 48 hrs 3824  353 migration inhibition 72 hrs 2086  385 migration inhibition all P less than 005 Control glomeruli from normal animals preimmunized animals given normal sheep globulin preimmunized animals given antiGBM antibody and Cyclosporin A and nonpreimmunized animals given antiGBM antibody did not contain glomerular Tlymphocytes and their supernatants contained no MIF activity This data indicates that the glomerular Tlymphocytes in preimmunized antiGBMGN are sensitized cells which release MIF and thus may direct glomerular macrophage localization in this model of antibodyinduced glomerulonephritis
R333	We recorded isometric and isotonic twitches in situ from the cat soleus at various muscle lengths and temperatures At a given temperature the duration of isometric twitches increased approximately 60 for each 10 increase in muscle length which was primarily owing to decreases in the rate of relaxation For the relaxation of isometric twitches recorded at different muscle lengths the equivalent activation energies determined were the same 132  03 kcalM The duration of isotonic twitch contractions increased only 20 for each 10 increase in muscle length Even a small amount of shortening 3 diminished the dependence of twitch duration on muscle length In this case twitch duration increased approximately 30 for every 10 increase in muscle length Hence even small changes in internal andor external compliance eg changes in the tendonfiber continuity can greatly influence twitch duration Our findings are consistent with the hypotheses that in the cat soleus Ca2 sequestration is primarily governed by a single energy dependent process and that the Ca2 sensitivity of the contractile apparatus increases with increasing sarcomere length

R335	The United States has long made its academic medical resources available to foreign medical graduates Conspicuously absent from the number of foreign nationals however have been physicians scientists and educators from the Soviet Union Under the new conditions of perestroika Soviet medical professionals are seeking ways in which to open up broad collaboration with their American counterparts Agreements are being sought between national organizations between academic medical institutions and for the exchange of individual scholars Cooperation in the area of medical education is one of the distinctive bridges on the path to mutual understanding that will represent a strong link in the public diplomacy of the two superpowers We recently had the opportunity to discuss in Moscow some of the issues with the USSR Minister of Health and with the Prorector for International Programs of the Central Institute for Advanced Medical Studies as well as with faculty members young medical scientists and medical students of the Moscow Medical Institutes We describe briefly many of the similarities and some of the dissonances between our two health systems and set forth ideas for an exchange program in medical education
R336	Rabbit hindlimb preparations perfused with blood from donor rabbits were used to determine whether O2 consumption VO2 during hypoxemia is limited by total O2 transport TO2 or by capillary O2 driving pressure as reflected by the venous PO2 PVO2 The preparations were randomized into two groups low flow LF and high flow HF perfused at 18 and 32 mlmin1kg of preparation wt1 respectively After a 1h baseline period with arterial PO2 PaO2 greater than 100 Torr both groups were exposed to progressive decrements in PaO2 to less than 10 Torr Sequential sets of arterial and venous blood gases were obtained and VO2 TO2 and O2 extraction ratio ERO2 were calculated A plot of PVO2 vs TO2 showed higher levels of PVO2 P less than 005 in LF than HF when compared at similar levels of TO2 Therefore the experimental protocol allowed the comparison of the separate effects of TO2 or PVO2 on VO2 Plotting VO2 as a function of TO2 revealed two distinct curves P less than 005 with LF having a greater VO2 than HF at a given TO2 Conversely a plot of VO2 as a function of PVO2 did not show a difference between the groups The ERO2 of LF was greater than HF when compared at similar levels of TO2 P less than 005 We conclude from these data that during progressive hypoxemia VO2 appears to be primarily limited by factors that determine capillary O2 diffusion This conclusion supports the Kroghian theory of capillary O2 exchange
R337	Qa2 a cellsurface glycoprotein anchored by phosphatidylinositol PI is structurally related to the class I transplantation antigens H2 K D and L which are integral membrane glycoproteins The predicted transmembrane segment of Qa2 differs from those of H2 K D and L by the presence of an aspartate in place of a valine at position 295 A single base change that replaced this aspartate with valine resulted in cellsurface Qa2 molecules that were insensitive to hydrolysis by a PIspecific phospholipase C and more resistant to papain cleavage properties shared by H2D Cells expressing AspVal mutant Qa2 proteins were still able to attach a PI anchor to endogenous proteins such as Thy1 and J11D It therefore appears that this single amino acid change converts Qa2 from a PIlinked form into an integral membrane protein
R338	Genetic relations between various Jewish J and nonJewish NJ populations were assessed using two sets of data The first set contained 12 pairs of matched J and NJ populations from Europe the Middle East and North Africa for which 10 common polymorphic genetic systems 13 loci were available The second set included 22 polymorphic genetic systems 26 loci with various numbers of populations ranging from 21 to 51 for each system Therefore each system was studied separately Neis standard genetic distance D matrices obtained for these two sets of data were tested against design matrices specifying hypotheses concerning the affiliations of the tested populations The tests against single designs were carried out by means of Mantel tests Our results consistently show lower distances among J populations than with their NJ neighbors most simply explained by the common origin of the former Yet there is evidence also of genetic similarity between J and corresponding NJ populations suggesting reciprocal gene flow between these populations or convergent selection in a common environment The results of our study also indicate that stochastic factors are likely to have played a role in masking the descent relationships of the J populations
R339	The authors report studies on four pairs of donors and recipients in bone marrow transplantation BMT A broad range of gene markers at 41 gene loci including 11 red blood cell markers 5 human lymphocyte antigen HLA types 12 serum protein markers 5 red cell enzyme markers and 8 salivary markers were evaluated before and after BMT over 2 months As a result 9 out of 41 gene loci of genetic markers in recipients were transformed into the donor type BMT between family members may lead to transformation of gene markers but within a pattern compatible with family inheritance patterns and no genetic paradox will be found in later surveys of familial genetic relationships However in a personal identification system in forensic medicine using genetic markers as an index the appearance of a phenotype incompatible with a blood relationship is possible after BMT with a nonbloodrelative donor This result is similar to the inheritance pattern observed after artificial insemination by a donors semen AID a more complete outoffamily cross
R340	The significance of early renal graft function on longterm transplant survival is controversial From our pediatric renal transplant population we studied 151 children who had an initial cadaveric renal transplant were dependent on dialysis before transplantation and were 5 to 19 years old at transplantation We used dependence upon dialysis as the parameter for early graft function There was a statistically significant difference in longterm graft survival between patients who were independent of and dependent on dialysis at 1 week and 1 month postoperatively Our results show that early renal graft function is important for longterm graft survival All efforts should be directed to obtaining early renal graft function by proper organ procurement storage operative technique and aggressive postoperative management
R341	The genetic basis for the biosynthesis of large polypeptide antibiotics such as nisin has not been explained so far We show here that the structural gene epiA encoding the antibiotic epidermin from Staphylococcus epidermidis is located on a 54kilobase plasmid and codes for a 52aminoacid prepeptide which is processed to the tetracyclic 21peptide amide antibiotic The mature sequence of epidermin corresponds to the Cterminal 22peptide segment of preepidermin and contains the precursor amino acids Ser Thr and Cys from which the unusual aminoacid constituents are derived The more lipophilic epidermin is cleaved at a hydrophilic turn between Arg1 and Ile1 from the Nterminal segment30 to 1 which probably assumes a partially amphiphilic alphahelix conformation We propose that the Nterminus 30 to 1 plays a cooperative role during modification reactions and prevents toxicity of the mature epidermin to the producing strain before the antibiotic is cleaved off and secreted
R342	Quantitative autoradiography revealed large numbers of angiotensinII AT receptors in the 18dayold rat embryo The selective AT1 antagonist DuP 753 readily competed for AT receptors in liver lung parenchyma and choroid plexus and these receptors are classified as AT1 receptors The selective AT2 displacers CGP 42112 A andor PD 123177 competed with high affinity with AT bound to most receptors located in skeletal muscle skin diaphragm bronchi and stomach and these receptors are classified as AT2 receptors The amount of AT2 receptors in fetal tissue was more than 10fold higher than that of AT1 receptors In skeletal muscle and skin DuP 753 competed with AT in the presence of 107 M CGP 42112 A indicating the presence of small numbers of AT1 receptors In liver and lung parenchyma binding to AT1 receptors was sensitive to guanine nucleotides AT binding to AT2 receptors in fetal skin and skeletal muscle was insensitive to guanine nucleotides AT stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in liver ED50 64 nM and in skin and skeletal muscle ED50 62 nM this was inhibited by DuP 753 liver IC50 38 nM skin and skeletal muscle IC50 26 nM but not by PD 123177 in concentrations up to the micromolar range AT1 receptors are probably coupled to Gproteins and their stimulation increases phosphoinositide hydrolysis AT2 receptors may not be linked to Gproteins their stimulation is not associated with phosphoinositide hydrolysis and the nature of their second messenger systems is presently unknown

R344	Fetal ventral mesencephalon and fetal adrenal tissue grafted to the caudate nucleus of four and three parkinsonian patients respectively have been shown to be an alternative treatment for the amelioration of the signs of the disease The ventral mesencephalon patients had a significant amelioration of rigidity bradykinesia postural imbalance gait disturbance and facial expression Three of these four patients have returned to work The fatal adrenal group only showed amelioration of rigidity and bradykinesia Though these patients are now able to perform their basic daily living activities and one of them has renewed her household tasks the other two have not yet been able to return to work The differences observed between the ventral mesencephalon and the fetal adrenaltransplanted patients may be related to the heterogeneity of their disease andor the type of graft implanted However encouraging our results may be this experimental procedure obviously requires further studies and should not be practiced outside of highly qualified clinical research centers
R345	Family Medicine clerkships emphasizing ambulatory care often require multiple teaching sites Continuous assessment of actual student clinical experiences may not occur because the task of collecting and analyzing the necessary data may be expensive and timeconsuming However the decreasing price of microcomputers and available software has provided teaching programs with inexpensive and effective tools to perform this task The Department of Family Medicine at the Medical College of Georgia recently developed and implemented a microcomputer based information management system for use in assessing program and student clinical experiences in a required family medicine clerkship This system which uses logbooks as an information source is able to monitor and provide information which is used to insure that the students actual clinical experiences are consistent with the goals and objectives of the clerkship
R346	We retrospectively analyzed the relationship between rheumatoid factor RF and renal disease in 102 patients with systemic lupus erythematosus SLE We found a significant negative association between detectable RF at any time in a patients course and clinically significant renal diseases Multivariate analysis indicates that RF and cryoglobulins operating independently have a significant and opposite association with the development of renal disease in patients with SLE These associations appear to be unrelated to the presence or absence of antidsDNA antiDNA Patients with SLE who are RF negative and cryoglobulin positive are likely to develop renal disease whereas those who are RF positive and cryoglobulin negative are very unlikely to do so The addition of RF and cryoglobulin determinations to the data base of patients with SLE appears to be clinically useful
R347	The construction of a family pedigree consumes an average of 1520 minutes during a typical preamniocentesis counseling session The records of 1131 patients were reviewed to determine whether development of a pedigree before amniocentesis reveals conditions other than those for which the patient was referred often enough to justify the time spent in the process The patients were referred for a variety of reasons with increased maternal age the most common A positive finding in the pedigree was any condition other than that for which the patient was referred and that required additional comments or testing It was found that 7215 of the pedigrees contained at least one other positive finding Thus construction of a pedigree before genetic amniocentesis is a valuable objective since it reveals in the majority of cases additional factors that may influence the current or future pregnancies or may provide information for other family members
R348	Subacute encephalitis caused by infection of the central nervous system by the human immunodeficiency virus HIV is the most frequent cause of neurologic dysfunction in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS This disorder results in progressive cognitive motor and behavioral abnormalities in at least two thirds of patients with AIDS Pathologic evidence of subacute encephalitis is found in 90 of these patients at autopsy Human immunodeficiency virus is also the etiologic agent of aseptic meningitis a disease that can occur at the time of seroconversion Other neurologic disorders frequently associated with HIV include peripheral neuropathies and vacuolar myelopathy Thus HIV is neurotropic and may enter the central nervous system early in the course of infection Neurologic disease may be the only clinical manifestation of HIV infection Although mechanisms of pathogenesis are unclear cells of monocytemacrophage lineage may be important in viral spread to and within the central nervous system Effective antiviral therapy will probably require penetration of drugs across the bloodbrain barrier
R349	Several glucagon analogs were synthesized in an effort to find derivatives that would bind with high affinity to the glucagon receptor of rat liver membranes but would not activate membranebound adenylate cyclase and therefore would serve as antagonists of the hormone Measurements on a series of glucagonsecretin hybrids indicated that replacement of Asp9 in glucagon by Glu9 found in secretin was the important sequence difference in the N terminus of the two hormones Further deletion of His1 and introduction of a Cterminal amide resulted in desHis1Glu9glucagon amide which had a 40 binding affinity relative to that of native glucagon but caused no detectable adenylate cyclase activation in the rat liver membrane This antagonist completely inhibited the effect of a concentration of glucagon that alone gave a full agonist response It had an inhibition index of 12 The pA2 was 72 An attempt was made to relate conformation with receptor binding The peptides were synthesized by solidphase methods and purified to homogeneity by reversephase highperformance liquid chromatography on C18silica columns
R350	The acute hemodynamic effects of captopril were evaluated at cardiac catheterization in 16 children age 0318 years with cardiomyopathy Twelve children had congestive cardiomyopathy whereas four had restrictive cardiomyopathy Hemodynamic measurements were obtained 30 and 60 minutes after the oral administration of captopril 05 mgkg Blood pressures were measured in the aorta pulmonary artery right atrium and pulmonary capillary wedge position cardiac outputs were measured by the thermodilution technique Hemodynamic data could not be obtained after the administration of captopril in one child with congestive cardiomyopathy because of an immediate severe hypotensive response In 11 of 12 children with congestive cardiomyopathy cardiac index increased by 22 from 23 to 28 lminm2 p less than 005 and stroke volume increased by 22 from 23 to 28 mlm2 p less than 005 Systemic vascular resistance decreased from 32 to 21 unitsm2 p less than 001 but the mean aortic pressure did not change significantly In contrast four children with restrictive cardiomyopathy had no change in cardiac output after captopril but there was a trend toward significant arterial hypotension mean aortic pressure decreased from 78 to 59 mm Hg Thus captopril acutely reduced systemic vascular resistance and increased both cardiac output and stroke volume in children with congestive cardiomyopathy In children with restrictive cardiomyopathy however captopril did not affect cardiac output but it did decrease aortic pressure These data indicate that captopril may benefit children with a congestive cardiomyopathy but that captopril probably should not be used in children with restrictive disease
R351	The lipid transport protein apolipoprotein E apoE is expressed in many peripheral tissues in vivo including the adrenal gland and testes To investigate the role of apoE in adrenal cholesterol homeostasis we have expressed a human apoE genomic clone in the Y1 mouse adrenocortical cell line Y1 cells do not express endogenous apoE mRNA or protein Expression of apoE in Y1 cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in basal steroidogenesis secretion of fluorogenic steroid was reduced 7 to greater than 100fold relative to Y1 parent cells Addition of 5cholesten3 beta25diol failed to overcome the suppression of steroidogenesis in these cells Cholesterol esterification under basal conditions as measured by the production of cholesteryl 14Coleate was similar in the Y1 parent and the apoEtransfected cell lines Upon incubation with adrenocorticotropin or dibutyryl cAMP production of cholesteryl 14Coleate decreased 5fold in the Y1 parent cells but was unchanged in the apoEtransfected cell lines These results suggest that apoE may be an important modulator of cholesterol utilization and steroidogenesis in adrenal cells
R352	Concerns about quality of life and the cost of medical care raise questions about the effectiveness of cardiopulmonary resuscitation CPR efforts This study explores the role of age in resuscitation outcome by focusing on the CPR experience of all patients age 75 years and older in a community hospital during a oneyear period Data are based on a retrospective study of the medical records of 86 such patients While 41 percent survived the initial resuscitation effort only 23 percent regained conscious functioning 12 percent left the hospital and only 7 percent survived to be discharged from the hospital and were alive one year later None of the 26 patients over the age of 85 survived resuscitation Among the 75 to 84yearold patients the diagnosis of acute onset arrhythmia and dementia were associated with a better survival prognosis Crude estimates of cost based on charges for crash carts intensive care and bed rates totalled over 100000 over onehalf the amount was allocated to the 21 patients who were unconscious before finally dying the hospital The study suggests the importance of continuing discussion about quality of life and cost implications of resuscitation of elderly patients
R353	Antihistamines are the drugs of choice in the symptomatic relief of chronic urticaria however the usefulness of classic antihistamines has been limited by side effects especially daytime sedation In the 1980s a new class of antihistamines has been developed that maintains effectiveness and produces less sedation This review analyzes each of the new nonsedating antihistamines and evaluates its clinical efficacy safety and convenience in the treatment of chronic urticaria
R354	The precise mechanisms and sites of action of general anaesthetic agents remain a mystery The early theories of anaesthesia concentrated on a unitary mechanism however many recent investigations emphasize specific interactions between anaesthetic agents and excitable membranes In this study volatile anaesthetics halothane isoflurane enflurane and diethyl ether applied as vapours in clinical concentrations were observed to produce differential effects on the discharge activity of an isolated crayfish neurone In addition both enflurane and diethyl ether induced bursts of discharge activity at concentrations known to produce EEG seizure activity in animals and man These observations do not support the concept of a common nonspecific mechanism of action but provide further evidence that the action of volatile anaesthetics is selective and may involve multiple sites or mechanisms or both
R355	The subcellular origin of membranes from rat skeletal muscle that contain insulinresponsive glucose transporters was investigated Rat skeletal muscle membranes were prepared by isopycnic centrifugation in sucrose gradients In vivo insulin treatment increased the content of GLUT4 glucose transporters in the 25 sucrose fraction enriched in the plasma membrane marker 5nucleotidase and decreased it in the 35 sucrose fraction devoid of plasma membrane markers The possibility of endothelial cell membrane contamination in these fractions was investigated using a mouse monoclonal antibody MRC OX43 raised against a cell surface protein specific to rat vascular endothelium MRC OX43 did not react with any of the muscle membrane fractions but did recognize a protein of around 100 kDa in extracts of human endothelial cells and rat aorta An antibody to the dihydropyridine receptor of skeletal muscle IIC12 was used to determine the presence of transverse tubules in these fractions IIC12 reacted positively with a 180kDa protein in purified rat transverse tubules In contrast this antibody did not crossreact with the 25 or 35 sucrose fractions The 25 sucrose fraction was devoid of calsequestrin and ryanodine receptor cisternal sarcoplasmic reticulum markers However small amounts of these proteins were detected in the 35 sucrose fraction The results suggest that the 25 sucrose fraction represents plasma membranes while the 35 sucrose fraction is an insulinsensitive intracellular fraction that contains but is not enriched in sarcoplasmic reticulum cisternae The results further show that insulininduced recruitment of GLUT4 transporters in skeletal muscles can be demonstrated independently of GLUT4 recruitment in endothelial cells
R356	A method of quantifying the anatomic extent of injury to the heart Penetrating Cardiac Trauma Index PCTI and other thoracic organs has been proposed The total extent of thoracic injury Penetrating Thoracic Trauma Index PTTI was measured When associated abdominal injury was present it was assessed by the Penetrating Abdominal Trauma Index PATI of Moore et al The severity of total injury sustained by the patient represented by the Penetrating Trauma Index PTI was determined by the sum total of these scores The extent of physiologic abnormality induced by cardiac penetration Physiologic Index or PI was graded on a scale of increasing severity from 520 based on the vital signs of patients on admission Analysis of 112 patients with penetrating cardiac injuries 19731983 revealed that the indices PCTI and PI showed an excellent correlation with survival R2  0827 and 0928 respectively as did the total extent of trauma PTI A composite prognostic score of the sum of PI and PTI demonstrated a significant separation of survivors from nonsurvivors p less than 0001 It is concluded that these anatomic PCTI and PTI and physiologic PI indices are valid and with additional confirmation may provide an objective method of evaluating penetrating cardiac injuries
R357	Vision in most vertebrates is an active process that requires the brain to combine retinal signals with information about eye movement Eye movement information may feed forward from the motor control areas of the brain or feed back from the extrinsic eye muscles Feedback signals elicited by passive eye movement selectively gate retinal outflow at the first relay the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus The gating predominantly facilitates retinogeniculate transmission immediately after eye movement and inhibits transmission when a new steadystate eye position is achieved These two gating effects are distributed in a complementary fashion across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus such that the spatiotemporal activity profile could contribute to object detection and localization
R358	We observed the pigment dispersion syndrome in two patients after keratoplasty with posterior chamber intraocular lenses In addition to a heavily pigmented trabecular meshwork and iris transilluminating defects an inferior linear pigmented endothelial line was seen in both patients One patient developed glaucoma which was well controlled with medication Pigment dispersion syndrome in patients with penetrating keratoplasty should not be confused with an allograft reaction but should alert the transplant surgeon that a different process is occurring
R359	Between 1985 and 1987 examinations for human immune deficiency virus HIV antibody were done on 25392 prostitutes working in 64 cities throughout the Philippines The countrywide seropositivity rate among prostitutes based on this sample was 081000 Of the HIV cases 85 were working in just two cities whose prostitute populations comprised 50 of the total sample The average incidence rate for the same two cities after 1 year was 231000 HIV antibodypositive women were enrolled in a casecontrol study to determine demographic and epidemiologic risk factors This study involving 34 HIVpositive prostitutes and 61 randomly selected negative control prostitutes did not reveal any risk factors related to sexual or other types of behavior A history of genital warts a history of abnormal vaginal discharge and cytomegalovirus antibody were significantly more frequent in the HIVpositive cases than in the controls however by logistic regression analysis only an abnormal vaginal discharge was independently associated with HIV infection Absence of any evidence of transmission by blood transfusion or iv drug abuse suggests that HIV was introduced by the heterosexual route
R360	We studied six infants and children with intracardiac masses of different causes The diagnosis was made noninvasively using twodimensional echocardiography in all six patients In five patients surgical excision of the mass was undertaken with good results Twodimensional echocardiography is an excellent noninvasive diagnostic tool that allows the clinician to determine the size and location of intracardiac masses in infants and children
R361	We studied the relationship between eight variables including age sex baseline plasma betacarotene BC concentration and smoking status and the increase in plasma BC in 582 subjects receiving oral supplementation with 50 mg BCd Median plasma BC concentrations after 1 y of supplementation increased from 335 nmolL at entry to 3163 nmolL Changes in plasma BC concentrations ranged widely from 313 to 16090 nmolL median 2721 nmolL Multivariate analysis revealed that the subjects plasma BC concentration before supplementation was the most important indicator of the amount of increase after supplementation Nonsmokers women and leaner subjects all had larger increases in plasma concentrations although the statistical model could account for relatively little of the variability in subjects plasma response to BC supplementation R2  014 We conclude that betweensubject variability in response to daily supplementation with oral BC is very large and that the best predictor of this response is the initial plasma BC concentration
R362	Difficulties in culturing the bacterium Treponema pallidum have greatly hindered syphilis research In recent years several laboratories have begun applying recombinant DNA technology to the study of this organism Recent work is summarized concerning the expression of T pallidum DNA in Escherichia coli A number of E coli clones expressing treponemal protein antigens have been identified In one instance a recombinant protein was purified to homogeneity and shown to be identical to a highly immunogenic native T pallidum membrane protein of molecular weight 39000 which was designated the basic membrane protein BMP of this organism In addition recent experiments are described that were designed to identify cellsurface proteins that would serve as the primary focus of our cloning efforts Results obtained with use of several different approaches strongly suggest that the outer membrane of T pallidum is an antigenically inert structure largely devoid of protein However a class of lowmolecularweight protein antigens have been identified that are actively secreted into the extracellular medium Attempts currently are being made to clone these secreted proteins and investigate their roles in the pathogenesis and immunobiology of syphilis
R363	We conducted a prospective study of 459 women to determine if a onesession class in breast selfexamination BSE can improve competence and frequency Women who attended the class were randomly assigned to one of two groups We assessed three areas of competence of BSE in one group immediately before the class in the other group immediately after the class and in both groups at followup one year later Of the 459 women who attended the class 286 returned for the oneyear followup All three areas of competence measured showed significant improvement in the group tested immediately after the class compared with the group tested just before the class Competence scores at the oneyear followup remained twice as high as those before the class although there was a decrease in competence from just after the class Younger women proved more competent in performing BSE than did older women At one year participants further reported performing BSE nearly twice as often as before the class We conclude that competent BSE can be learned and frequency of BSE can be increased from a onesession class
R364	We have verified the hypothesis that multiple myeloma MM may be disseminated by circulating clonogenic cells that selectively home to the bone marrow BM to receive the signals leading to proliferation terminal differentiation and production of the osteoclast activating factors Longterm cultures of stromal cells have been developed from the BM of nine patients with MM These cells were mostly fibroblastlike elements interspersed with a proportion of scattered macrophages and rare osteoclasts BM stromal cells were CD54 produced high levels of interleukin6 IL6 and measurable amounts of IL1 beta and were used as feeder layers for autologous peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC After 3 weeks of cocultures monoclonal B lymphocytes and plasma cells derived from PBMC developed and the number of osteoclasts significantly increased Both populations grew tightly adherent to the stromal cell layer and their expansion was matched by a sharp increase of IL6 and by the appearance of IL3 in the culture supernatant These data attribute to BM stromal cells a critical role in supporting the growth of B lymphocytes plasma cells and osteoclasts and the in vivo dissemination of MM
R365	The use of serial chest radiographs to assess disease activity in patients with sarcoidosis is controversial However reliance on the symptomatic clinical course to assess disease activity may be misleading As many patients being treated with corticosteroids have an abrupt clinical deterioration when doses of those medications are decreased we questioned whether the chest radiograph could depict alterations in disease activity as measured by spirometry in this subset of patients We retrospectively reviewed the clinical course of all patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis in whom the corticosteroid dose was reduced during a 6month period The 15 patients without fever chills or purulent sputum during that time were then examined to determine the presence n  10 or absence n  5 of a symptomatic relapse All patients who had a symptomatic relapse also had a fall in forced vital capacity of at least 10 suggesting an increase in disease activity Serial chest radiographs were evaluated during and after corticosteroid dose reductions and after clinical recovery on higher steroid doses in the patients who had had a relapse In eight patients the disease was in radiographic stage 2 hilar adenopathy and parenchymal lung disease in seven patients it was in radiographic stage 3 parenchymal lung disease alone The disease did not change stage in any patient during the study Chest radiographs worsened more frequently in patients who had a clinical relapse seven of 10 than in those who did not have a relapse zero of five p less than 05 An alveolar chest radiographic pattern n  4 or reticulonodular pattern n  3 was noted in the seven patients who had a relapse with worsening on radiographs often occurring before detection of relapse by symptomatology four of seven or spirometry three of seven Spirometry and radiographs improved or stabilized after an increase in corticosteroid dose in all 10 patients who had a relapse We conclude that serial chest radiographs can reflect clinical relapse in patients with sarcoidosis during corticosteroid dose reduction Furthermore worsening seen on chest radiographs may be the first evidence of relapse
R366	Both human lymphoblastoid interferon HLBI and bestrabucil the conjugate of chlorambucil and betaestradiol have antitumor activity against adult Tcell leukemialymphoma ATLL Because an in vitro study showed that these two agents combined had a synergistic antiproliferative effect on MOLT4 and WI38VA13 cell lines the authors evaluated the clinical efficacy of this combination in a pilot study with a poorrisk group of ATLL patients The patients were treated daily with 6 x 106 IU of HLBI subcutaneously and 100 mg of bestrabucil orally In patients with lymphomatype ATLL or hypercalcemia prednisolone also was given daily Of 12 patients suitable for evaluation nine had partial responses one had a minor response and two had no response All five patients with skin infiltration and both patients with hypercalcemia responded A history of prior chemotherapy did not affect the response rate The time to clinical response was 3 to 16 days median 11 days after initiation of treatment The response duration was 4 to 108 weeks median 9 weeks but all patients except one relapsed even during continuing treatment No serious side effects were observed Although the response rate with this combination treatment was high the response duration was short and other treatments would have to be added to achieve control of this aggressive disease
R367	Bloodpool radionuclide angiography was used to investigate the left ventricular function in eight patients who received a Novacor assist device as a bridgetocardiac transplantation Studies were performed during maximal and minimal tolerated assist device flows The left ventricular ejection fraction volumes cardiac output and the pump ejection fraction were computerassessed All patients had severe left ventricular dilation and hypokinesis before insertion of the assist device with a mean ejection fraction of 18  4 which improved to 44  18 p less than 001 during maximal assist device flows but fell to 25  15 p less than 001 during minimal flows The ventricular volumes became normal at maximal assist device flow but increased significantly p less than 005 during minimal flow The pump was well visualized and had an ejection fraction of 82  7 These data indicate that this assist device effectively unloads the left ventricle The deterioration in ejection fraction following decrease in assist device flow is in keeping with the dependency of these patients on the device to sustain adequate hemodynamics
R368	Computed tomography has been used to study the pharyngeal airway during tidal breathing in wakefulness and during obstructive apnoeas in NonREM sleep in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea In supine subjects contiguous transverse 10 mm sections were taken perpendicular to the posterior pharyngeal wall with a 21 s scan time Studies during wakefulness showed that the narrowest section of the pharyngeal airspace was in the region posterior to the soft palate and that the minimal airway crosssectional areas were significantly reduced in the group of patients with obstructive sleep apnoea compared to the group of control subjects without obstructive sleep apnoea The studies during sleep showed that in all patients the airspace posterior to the soft palate was a site of obstructive apnoeas The length of the obstructed segment varied between patients extending below the level of the soft palate in half the patient group Airway narrowing and obstruction was due to posterior displacement of the soft palate and the tongue in the majority of patients although lateral displacement of the pharyngeal walls was also observed No occlusion was observed in the laryngopharynx although there was narrowing of oro and laryngopharyngeal apertures below the site of obstruction during obstructive apnoeas The size of the oropharyngeal airspace during wakefulness did not predict the presence of airway occlusion below the level of the soft palate when asleep The variability between patients in the sites of upper airway obstruction during obstructive apnoeas have important implications for the choice of appropriate treatment in patients with obstructive sleep apnoea
R369	BACKGROUND Cocaine abuse has been implicated as a cause of death due to sudden cardiac arrest METHODS AND RESULTS We examined the hemodynamic and electrophysiological effects of cocaine administered as a series of 5mgkg iv boluses coupled with a continuous infusion in anesthetized dogs Sodium bicarbonate 50 meq iv was administered as a potential antidote in 11 of 15 dogs and intravenous 5 dextrose was given in the remaining four In a dosedependent fashion cocaine significantly decreased blood pressure coronary blood flow and cardiac output increased PR QRS QT and QTc intervals and sinus cycle length and increased ventricular effective refractory period and dispersion of ventricular refractoriness No afterdepolarizations were noted in the monophasic action potential recording Nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia occurred spontaneously in two dogs and sustained ventricular tachycardia could be induced by programmed stimulation at the end of the dosing protocol in five of 11 animals Sodium bicarbonate promptly decreased cocaineinduced QRS prolongation to nearly that measured at baseline but had no effect on the other electrocardiographic or hemodynamic variables In one dog sodium bicarbonate administration was associated with reversion of ventricular tachycardia to sinus rhythm CONCLUSIONS We conclude that highdose cocaine possesses negative inotropic and potent type I electrophysiological effects Sodium bicarbonate selectively reversed cocaineinduced QRS prolongation and may be a useful treatment of ventricular arrhythmias associated with slowed ventricular conduction in the setting of cocaine overdose
R370	The invariant chain Ii a nonpolymorphic glycoprotein that associates with the immunoregulatory Ia proteins encoded by the major histocompatibility complex has a proteoglycan form IiCS that bears a chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan In this proteoglycan form Ii may remain associated with Ia at the cell surface Inhibitors that prevent the addition of glycosaminoglycan to Ii have been found to depress antigenpresenting function Ii does not have multiple candidate glycosaminoglycanattachment sites and we used sitedirected mutagenesis to replace a candidate serine glycosaminoglycanacceptor site with alanine at position 201 in the murine Ii protein Transfection of the normal or altered gene into Iinegative COS7 cells showed that equivalent amounts of core Ii protein and its acidic terminally glycosylated forms were synthesized but the Ala201 mutant Ii did not give rise to IiCS The mutant protein had apparently normal transport through the Golgi compartment and associated stably with Ia molecules Thus this mutation directly identifies the site of glycosaminoglycan addition and shows that it can be eliminated without adversely affecting the overall biosynthesis of Ii
R371	We studied the biologic properties of hamsteradapted scrapie strain 263K and its relationship to the precursor protein of scrapie PrP3335Sc The highest titer of infectious material and the greatest concentration of PrP3335Sc were in the fractions containing microsomal and synaptosomal membranes We found traces of infectivity in the absence of PrP3335Sc associated with matrix protein Partitioning of membranes with neutral chloroformmethanol resulted in concentration of PrP3335Sc and infectivity within the interphase layer Recombination of membrane glycoproteins interphase with lipids extracted from homologous brains decreased infectivity greater than or equal to 4 logs Temperaturedependent phase separation of infected synaptosomal and microsomal membranes with Triton X114 yielded a phospholipidrich phase containing a high concentration of PrP3335Sc and greatest infectivity titers This material spontaneously formed liposomes indicating that PrP3335Sc and PrP3335C precursor proteins are highly hydrophobic intrinsic membrane components integrated with phospholipids Homologous membrane phospholipids appear to prevent aggregation of the scrapie isoform of PrP and maintain high levels of infectivity
R372	We wished to determine whether adenosine a purine nucleotide modulates activity of respiratory cilia and to this end we studied cultured rabbit tracheal epithelium in response to adenosine and related substances in vitro Ciliary beat frequency CBF as determined by a photoelectric method was depressed by adenosine 103 M the maximal decrease from the baseline value 965  29 beatsmin mean  SE being 316  50 p less than 0001 The adenosine A2receptor agonist Nethylcarboxamide adenosine had only a small effect on ciliary activity whereas other adenosine analogs elicited decreases in CBF in a dosedependent fashion The order of potency of ciliainhibitory action was Ncyclohexyladenosine an agonist for adenosine A1receptor greater than phenylisopropyladenosine greater than adenosine greater than Nethylcarboxamide adenosine Intracellular cyclic AMP cAMP levels were decreased by 103 M adenosine from 392  65 to 253  48 pMmg protein p less than 005 The effect of adenosine on CBF was enhanced by dipyridamole an adenosine uptake inhibitor and by deoxycoformycin an adenosine deaminase inhibitor The adenosineinduced decreases in CBF and cAMP content were reversed by 8phenyltheophylline an adenosine receptor antagonist These results suggest that there is an adenosine A1receptor on rabbit tracheal epithelium that inhibits adenylate cyclase which may result in the impairment of respiratory ciliary activity and that adenosineinduced ciliary inhibition may be modulated by adenosine uptake and its catabolism by airway epithelial cells
R373	Previous studies have identified a saturable site of d3Hamphetamine sequestration AMSEQ in rat brain synaptosomes The present study characterized AMSEQ with respect to its subcellular neuronal and regional distributions ontogenetic development pharmacological specificity and factors required for its maintenance Although AMSEQ was reduced when assays were performed in Krebs buffer incubated at 37 degrees C as compared to assays performed in isotonic Trissucrose buffer incubated at room temperature the pharmacological profiles of AMSEQ were virtually identical under both conditions AMSEQ was negligible in tissues outside the central nervous system enriched in synaptosomes and partially reduced by striatal kainic acid lesion indicating neuronal localization The distribution of AMSEQ in the central nervous system was heterogenous Highest levels were present in hypothalamus with progressively lower levels noted in parietal cortex frontal cortex striatum thalamus hippocampus midbrain cerebellum ponsmedulla and spinal cord With regard to its ontogeny AMSEQ increased early in neonatal life reaching adult levels by postnatal day 14 Although the effects of amphetamine to abolish the transynaptosomal pH gradient suggest a possible role for this gradient in the maintenance of AMSEQ the pharmacological profile of AMSEQ indicates that other factors are involved An interaction with an intrasynaptosomal acid such as Nacetylaspartate may account for AMSEQ maintenance AMSEQ did not possess a stereospecific preference for either dIC50  177 microM or Iamphetamine IC50  173 microM However the pharmacological profile of AMSEQ indicated structural specificity with antidepressants being relatively potent inhibitors The saturation analysis and pharmacological characteristics of AMSEQ ie low affinity and lack of stereospecificity suggest that AMSEQ may be related to high dose nonstereospecific effects of amphetamine such as stereotypy in rats and psychosis in humans The relative high potency of antidepressants in inhibiting AMSEQ suggests the importance of this phenomenon in the therapeutic effects of these drugs Furthermore the link between antidepressants and AMSEQ may provide insight into the comorbidity of major depression and drug abuse
R374	Cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are divided into two major groups microcystic adenomas and mucinous cystic neoplasms Five microcystic adenomas and seven mucinous cystic neoplasms three cystadenomas and four cystadenocarcinomas were examined with both magnetic resonance MR imaging and computed tomography CT The cystic content was differentiated more easily with MR imaging than with CT It was homogeneous in four of the five microcystic adenomas all of which had lobulated borders best seen on T2weighted images The mucinous cystadenomas and cystadenocarcinomas were all composed of multiple compartments that varied in signal intensity The septa shape and wall thickness were demonstrated on T1 andor T2weighted MR images almost as well as on CT scans Overall MR imaging was equal or slightly superior to CT in the diagnosis of pancreatic cystic neoplasms except in its limited ability to demonstrate calcifications of the tumor wall and septa
R375	We report the first case of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus presenting with exfoliative erythroderma Although our patient had uniquely extensive skin disease she had the clinical histologic serologic and immunogenetic features of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus Complete remission was obtained with a short course of systemic corticosteroids and longterm hydroxychloroquine therapy We briefly discuss the usual features of subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus
R376	We describe a patient with inclusion body myositis presenting as chronic therapy resistant polymyositis Our report highlights the slow evolution of inclusion body myositis in some patients and emphasizes the diagnostic importance of examining one or more muscle biopsy specimens by both frozen section and electron microscopy
R377	The hammerhead RNA selfcleaving domain can be assembled from two RNA molecules a large approximately 34 nucleotide ribozyme RNA containing most of the catalytically essential nucleotides and a small approximately 13 nucleotide substrate RNA containing the cleavage site Four such hammerheads that contained identical catalytic core sequences but differed in the base composition of the helices that are involved in substrate binding had been reported to vary in cleavage rates by more than 70fold under similar reaction conditions Steadystate kinetic analyses reveal that kcat values are nearly the same for these hammerheads but Km values vary nearly 60fold The substrates for reactions having high Km values form aggregates that are virtually nonreactive These observations demonstrate that the secondary structure of substrate RNA can be a major determinant of hammerhead catalytic efficiency

R379	The secretion of enterotoxin by Vibrio cholerae is punctuated by the transient entry of the toxin subunits into the periplasm In this paper we show that the subunits oligomerize into an assembled holotoxin within the periplasm prior to their secretion across the outer membrane The rate of toxin assembly was studied by pulselabeling cells with 35Smethionine and then monitoring the turnover of radiolabeled subunits as they assembled within the periplasm The subunits entered the periplasm as monomers and assembled into oligomers with a halftime of approximately 1 min Since assembly was a rapid event compared to the rate of toxin efflux from the periplasm which had a halftime of approximately 13 min we conclude that all of the subunits that pass through the periplasm assemble before they traverse the outer membrane The average concentration of subunit monomers and assembled holotoxin within the periplasm was calculated to be approximately 20 and approximately 260 microgramsml respectively This indicates that the periplasm is a suitably concentrated milieu where spontaneous toxin assembly can occur Our findings suggest that protein movement across bacterial outer membranes in apparent contrast to export across other biological membranes involves translocation of polypeptides that have already folded into tertiary and even quaternary conformations
R380	The effect of HeNe laser radiation lambda  6328 nm I  68 Wm2 irradiation time from 5 to 50 sec on kinetics of spontaneous and Candida ablicansstimulated chemiluminescence of mouse spleen cells was studied It was found that laser radiation caused significant enhancement 180250 both of spontaneous chemiluminescence and Candidainduced chemiluminescence The effective dose interval ranges from 100 to 300 Jm2 with a maximum at 200 Jm2 This finding shows that HeNe laser irradiation can induce the respiratory burst generation of reactive oxygen species having bactericidal activity of phagocytic cells
R381	The pathological features in the lung in asbestosis and cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis are similar Patients with asbestosis however appear to have less severe impairment of transfer factor TLCO than those with fibrosing alveolitis for a given level of radiographic abnormality when assessed on the basis of the International Labour Organisation ILO profusion score The impairment of lung function in the two disorders has been compared in more detail in 29 patients with asbestosis and 25 with fibrosing alveolitis arterial oxygen desaturation during exercise being used to define the severity of the disorders Arterial oxygen saturation ear oximeter and oxygen uptake were measured during incremental exercise on a cycle ergometer TLCO single breath technique and total lung capacity TLC plethysmograph were measured Chest radiographs were graded for profusion according to the ILO international classification Patients with asbestosis had significantly higher mean values for TLCO and TLC and lower mean profusion scores than those with fibrosing alveolitis When stratified for the degree of arterial oxygen desaturation however no significant differences were found in TLCO TLC or profusion score between the two disorders To the extent that arterial oxygen desaturation with exercise reflects the morphological severity of the disease these results suggest that for a given degree of interstitial lung disease asbestosis and cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis are functionally and radiologically similar
R382	Two hundred thirty subjects with insulindependent diabetes were followed up longitudinally by measuring glycohemoglobin values to relate glucose control with renal and retinal complications Subjects with longterm poor control glycohemoglobin values greater than 15 times the upper limit of normal had 36 times the prevalence of microalbuminuria and 25 times the prevalence of level 3 to 6 retinopathy than that found in subjects with longterm good control glycohemoglobin values within 133 times the upper limit of normal Variables related to kidney damage were glucose control and to a lesser degree duration of diabetes Variables related to eye disease were in descending order of significance duration of diabetes glucose control and age No subject whose mean glycohemoglobin value was consistently within 11 times the upper limit of normal had retinopathy or microalbuminuria In contrast when the mean glycohemoglobin value was more than 15 times the upper limit of normal 24 29 of 82 subjects had microalbuminuria and 30 37 of 82 had level 3 to 6 retinopathy
R383	The present study investigates the integrity of the bloodbrain barrier to H or HCO3 during acute plasma acidosis in 35 newborn piglets anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium Cerebrospinal fluid acidbase balance cerebral blood flow CBF and cerebral oxygenation were measured after infusion of HCl 06 N 01910388 mlmin for a period of 1 h at a constant arterial PCO2 of 3540 Torr HCl infusion resulted in decreased arterial pH from 738  001 to 700  002 P less than 001 CBF measured by the tracer microsphere technique was decreased by 12 from 69  6 to 61  4 mlmin1100 g1 P less than 005 Infusion of 06 N NaCl as a hypertonic control had no effect on CBF Cerebral metabolic rate for O2 and O2 extraction was not significantly changed from control 383  020 mlmin1100 g1 and 57  06 ml100 ml respectively during acid infusion Cerebral venous PO2 was increased from 416  21 to 538  40 Torr by HCl infusion P less than 002 associated with a shift in O2hemoglobin affinity of blood in vivo from 38  2 to 50  1 Torr Cisternal cerebrospinal fluid pH decreased from 7336  0014 to 7226  0027 P less than 0005 but cerebrospinal fluid HCO3 concentration was not changed from control 254  10 meql These data suggest that there is a functional bloodbrain barrier in newborn piglets that is relatively impermeable to HCO3 or H and maintains cerebral perivascular pH constant in the face of acute severe arterial acidosis ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R384	PURPOSE The prevalence of the antiphospholipid syndrome was determined prospectively in patients presenting with stroke and transient ischemic attacks An attempt was made to define a subset of stroke patients at risk for this syndrome on the basis of their clinical features PATIENTS AND METHODS Fiftyone consecutive patients with stroke and transient ischemic attacks were assessed Tests used for the laboratory diagnosis of the antiphospholipid syndrome included four phospholipiddependent coagulation tests for detection of the lupus anticoagulant and two enzymelinked immunosorbent assays for antibodies to phospholipid RESULTS Three of 51 patients 6 95 confidence intervals 0 to 120 had a lupus anticoagulant and the clinical features of the antiphospholipid syndrome Seven patients had clinical features suggestive of the syndrome but negative laboratory tests Those patients who were clinically unlikely to have this syndrome also had negative laboratory tests CONCLUSION In a series of 51 unselected patients presenting with stroke and transient ischemic attacks three had the antiphospholipid syndrome The clinical features of this syndrome are helpful in identifying this group of patients The role of the lupus anticoagulant in the pathogenesis of stroke remains to be defined
R385	Many gene carriers for multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2a MEN 2a do not manifest the disease even into old age Thus a negative family history in a patient presenting with medullary thyroid carcinoma does not reliably exclude familial disease Data are reported for the probability that the MEN 2a gene will either have manifested clinically or be detectable by stimulated calcitonin screening by a given age These probabilities can be used to calculate individual risks and to guide screening
R386	A rare case of Munchausens syndrome beginning in early childhood is described The diagnosis of Munchausens syndrome was made at the age of 29 years after the symptoms had changed from acute abdominal to neurological complaints with feigned loss of consciousness first ascribed to an encephalitis Insight into the psychopathology of this patient is given by his biography by assessment of a psychotherapist who had treated him some years before and by his observed profile in some psychological tests
R387	Transgenic mouse lineages were established that carry the normal M or mutant Z alleles of the human alpha 1antitrypsin alpha 1Pi gene All of the alpha 1Pi transgenic mice expressed the human protein in the liver cartilage gut kidneys lymphoid macrophages and thymus The human Mallele protein was secreted normally into the serum However the human Zallele protein accumulated in several cell types but particularly in hepatocytes and was found in serum in tenfold lower concentrations than the Mallele protein Mice in one lineage carrying the mutant Z allele expressed high levels of human alpha 1Pi RNA and displayed significant runting 50 of normal weight in the neonatal period This lineage was found to have alpha 1Piinduced liver pathology in the neonatal period concomitant with the accumulation of human Z protein in diastaseresistant cytoplasmic globules that could be revealed in the Periodic acidSchiff reaction PAS The phenotype of mice in the strain expressing high levels of the Z allele is remarkably similar to human neonatal hepatitis and this strain may prove to be a useful animal model for studying this disease
R388	Using molecular cloning we earlier isolated the retinoblastoma gene mutations or deletions at this locus are associated with the hereditary predisposition to some human cancers especially retinoblastoma and osteosarcoma To develop diagnostic tests for such a predisposition we identified restrictionfragmentlength polymorphisms RFLPs within the retinoblastoma gene and tested their usefulness in predicting the risk of cancer in 20 families with members who had hereditary retinoblastoma We were able to make predictions in 19 of the 20 kindreds In 18 kindreds we demonstrated a consistent association of marker RFLPs with the mutation predisposing to retinoblastoma In the 19th kindred there may be a lack of cosegregation of the DNA polymorphisms within the gene and the site of the mutation predisposing to retinoblastoma However there is uncertainty about the clinical diagnosis of the retinal lesion in a key member of this kindred if the lesion is not a retinoblastoma there is no discrepancy between the DNA polymorphisms and the retinoblastoma trait We conclude that it is feasible and clinically useful to use these DNA polymorphisms to determine the risk of cancer
R389	We tested the clinical efficacy of a biologically active dose BAD of interferon IFNgamma for treatment of progressive renal cell carcinoma RCC Twentytwo RCC patients with disease progression subsequent to nephrectomy were entered on a phase II clinical trial During an initial dosefinding phase biochemical responses to repeated onceweekly subcutaneous injections of 10 100 or 500 micrograms of recombinant IFNgamma were tested in 16 patients Results indicated that 100 micrograms IFNgamma applied once weekly was biologically active with induction of serum beta 2microglobulin and neopterin Such a dose induced a nearly maximum response of both markers lasting more than 4 days This dose was also associated with minimal side effects A dose of 100 micrograms IFNgamma given once weekly was therefore subsequently given weekly for longterm treatment During a median time of therapy of 10 months range 2 to 32 months two complete CR 20 20 months and four partial tumor responses PR 6 7 8 24 months were seen 30 CR plus PR 95 confidence limits 12 to 54 among 20 patients evaluable for response Patients with refractory disease had significantly lower IFNgammainduced increments of serum beta 2microglobulin than those who achieved clinical remission or stable disease
R390	The apparent volume of distribution Vd of aminoglycosides was found to be increased in 100 patients in a surgical intensive care unit who had gramnegative pneumonia or intraabdominal sepsis and acute physiologic scores greater than 12 Following loading or maintenance doses carefully timed blood samples were collected for measurements of serum concentrations by fluorescence polarization immunoassay The Vd determined by linear regression analysis of a onecompartment model using the SawchukZaske method was 034  0121 Lkg and was larger than the normal Vd of 020 to 025 Lkg suggesting a 36 to 70 increase in extracellular fluid volume Since there is a predictable increase in aminoglycoside Vd in the septic surgical patient a proportionately larger aminoglycoside dosage is required initially to achieve desirable peak serum levels Close monitoring of blood levels during maintenance dosing is suggested since dynamic changes in renal function and aminoglycoside Vd occur in the critically ill
R391	Surgical isolation of the body of the right atrium presents a unique hemodynamic situation in which the synchronous right atrial contraction kick is lost but the synchronous left atrial contraction is preserved The hemodynamic effects of this procedure were evaluated by pacing at selected atrial sites postoperatively to simulate 1 sinus rhythm with a synchronous right atrial kick 2 sinus rhythm without a synchronous right atrial kick 3 right atrial tachycardia propagated to the entire heart propagated right atrial tachycardia and 4 right atrial tachycardia confined to the isolated right atrium with sinus rhythm in the rest of the heart confined right atrial tachycardia Hemodynamic data recorded under these four conditions showed that 1 during sinus rhythm synchrony of right atrial contraction had no significant effect on any of the hemodynamic parameters studied and 2 conversion from propagated right atrial tachycardia to confined right atrial tachycardia resulted in an increase in mean arterial pressure 65  5 to 78  3 mm Hg p less than 0005 and stroke volume index 9  1 to 19  3 mlbeatm2 p less than 0005 with a decrease in left atrial pressure 9  2 to 5  1 mm Hg p less than 005 and right atrial pressure 6  1 to 5  1 mm Hg p less than 005 Moreover cardiac hemodynamic performance remained within normal limits for up to 14 weeks Thus the right atrial isolation procedure does not adversely affect cardiac hemodynamics despite the loss of synchronous right atrial contraction during sinus rhythm and the procedure prevents hemodynamic deterioration during right atrial tachycardia
R392	We have used human CD4 T lymphocyte clones as primary probes to identify and isolate lambda gt11 rDNA clones that express epitopes recognized by T cells The method that we describe here permits a direct survey of T cell epitope coding sequences in genomic DNA or cDNA libraries A lambda gt11 library of Mycobacterium leprae DNA was screened with M lepraereactive human T cell clones as probes allowing the isolation of a M leprae DNA clone encoding the unidentified Ag This DNA clone differs in restriction maps from those previously identified by antibody probes and encodes an epitope that is unique to vaccine strains of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus CalmetteGuerin and pathogenic mycobacteria This method is generally applicable and should expedite the study of Ag and epitopes important to the T cell response in infections and in autoimmune diseases
R393	In the Tcell somatic mutant JCaM1 the Tcell antigen receptor complex is poorly coupled to the inositolphospholipid second messenger system some antibodies against the invariant CD3 subunit of the receptor retain their agonist function in JCaM1 Here we show by a combination of complementation assays that the mutation in JCaM1 affects a molecule other than the antigenbinding Ti subunit suggesting that Ti is coupled indirectly to the signal transduction apparatus through a pathway involving the CD3 complex We also describe another mutant JCaM2 in which the receptor complex is completely uncoupled from inositolphospholipid hydrolysis JCaM2 defines an additional complementation group suggesting that signal transduction by the antigen receptor depends on at least two molecules distinct from Ti
R394	To investigate a possible role of free radical production by xanthine oxidase in the pathogenesis of ethanolinduced hepatic lipid peroxidation chowfed rats were given ethanol 5 gkg and placed at 32 degrees C for 6 h which resulted in increased hepatic malondialdehyde levels Pretreatment with allopurinol in amounts that effectively inhibited xanthine metabolism also significantly decreased ethanolinduced lipid peroxidation suggesting participation of free radicals produced by xanthine oxidase in the peroxidative process Both acetaldehyde and purine can serve as substrates for xanthine oxidase Pretreatment with cyanamide increased hepatic acetaldehyde levels 5fold yet this was associated with a decrease in lipid peroxidation indicating that acetaldehyde is not the xanthine oxidase substrate involved By contrast ethanol increased hepatic contents of hypoxanthine and xanthine and enhanced urinary output of allantoin a final product of xanthine metabolism incriminating increased metabolism of purines Ethanol administration also enhanced hepatic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced form A corresponding rise of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced form in vitro inhibited xanthine dehydrogenase activity by 6076 Increased purine degradation possibly associated with a shift from the dehydrogenase to the xanthine oxidase pathway secondary to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reduced formmediated inhibition of xanthine dehydrogenase activity is proposed as a possible mechanism for ethanolstimulated free radical production Because allopurinol attenuates the associated lipid peroxidation this agent might be considered for possible therapeutic use in alcoholinduced liver damage
R395	To determine whether medical educators perceive a need for change in medical student education we analyzed data from a 1989 survey of 1369 respondents from all US schools of allopathic medicine Except for basic sciences faculty a majority of educators stated that fundamental changes are needed in medical student education in the United States Nearly three fourths of deans and associated deans reported the need for fundamental changes or thorough reform At least 79 of educators voiced support for six specific reforms such as rewarding teaching excellence and increasing clinical education in ambulatory and community settings While slight majorities supported reducing class size and centralizing governance substantial proportions stated that they would work against such reforms Most educators reported that a broad base of support within the school would be essential for change The survey suggests a restlessness among the leaders of medical education
R396	To study the national distribution of betalactam resistance patterns and mechanisms among Escherichia coli organisms isolated in US hospitals 652 ampicillinresistant Amr or ampicillinintermediate Ami isolates were submitted to the Centers for Disease Control from March 1983 through July 1984 by nine hospitals participating in the National Nosocomial Infections Study Among the isolates most of which caused urinary tract infections 78 were Amr and 22 were Ami by the interpretative criteria established by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards Resistance to carboxypenicillins ranged from 73 to 74 and that to acylureidopenicillins ranged from 43 to 66 A total of 26 of the isolates were resistant to cephalothin and 4 were resistant to cefazolin Resistance to cefoxitin was 1 while resistances to cefuroxime and cefamandole were 2 and 7 respectively With the exception of cefsulodin 98 resistant and cefoperazone 1 resistant there was no resistance to newer cephalosporins or aztreonam In general only minor differences in the incidence of resistance to betalactam antibiotics were noted in hospitalacquired versus nonhospitalacquired isolates as well as among isolates from various regions of the United States TEM betalactamases were produced by 87 of the 237 Amr isolates examined By our methods OXA and chromosomal type I betalactamases were detected in 2 and 28 isolates respectively and plasmidmediated extendedspectrum cephalosporinases were detected in none of the isolatesABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R397	The production of a 57K stress protein StrP after herpes simplex virus type 1 HSV1 infection was examined in cultured neonatal rat retinal cells StrP expression in individual cells was identified using a monoclonal antibody TI56 Indirect immunofluorescence of uninfected retinal cultures showed that approximately 40 of cells expressed neurofilament NF and 5 expressed a low level of StrP Following HSV infection the proportion of NF cells decreased while the proportion of StrP positive cells became greater and the intensity of staining increased The number of cells labelled with a polyclonal antiHSV antibody increased with time after infection Retinal neurons in culture can be infected with HSV after which StrP expression is significantly upregulated
R398	Delapril a new angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitor discovered in the laboratory of Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd is the result of drug design based on the structureactivity relationships of ACE inhibitors Delapril is an antihypertensive agent with a relatively long duration of action and no SH moiety in its structure Following administration it is converted into two active metabolites Delapril effectively lowered blood pressure in 73 of 1008 patients with hypertension during clinical trials in Japan Efficacy rates were 73 for essential hypertension 85 for renal hypertension and 80 for renovascular hypertension Excellent hypotensive response was observed in all age groups from young to elderly patients Side effects during administration of delapril based on subjective evidence were reported in 80 out of the 1008 cases 79 The main symptoms included orthostatic dizziness 17 dizziness 13 and nausea 11 Dry cough which has attracted attention in recent years as a side effect of ACE inhibitors was reported at a low incidence of 11 In a doubleblind controlled study in patients with mild to moderate essential hypertension in which captopril served as a positive control delapril showed superior hypotensive effect and greater safety Data derived from the Japan Study Group on Delapril indicate that this ACE inhibitor has excellent hypotensive effects and a high level of safety It is suitable as a firstline drug in both monotherapy and combined therapy
R399	Hair transplantation between monozygotic twins was used to repair a marked congenital nonprogressive alopecia of the scalp The alopecia was due to a follicular aplasia that along with several other abnormalities of the integumentary system affected only one of the twins This case represents a unique application of isograft transplantation
R400	Fourteen of 39 dialysis patients 36 became hypercalcemic after switching to calcium carbonate as their principal phosphate binder In order to identify risk factors associated with the development of hypercalcemia indirect parameters of intestinal calcium reabsorption and bone turnover rate in these 14 patients were compared with results in 14 eucalcemic patients matched for age sex length of time on dialysis and etiology of renal disease In addition to experiencing hypercalcemic episodes with peak calcium values of 27 to 38 mmolL 107 to 150 mgdL patients in the hypercalcemic group exhibited a significant increase in the mean calcium concentration obtained during 6 months before the switch compared with the mean value obtained during the 7 months of observation after the switch 24  003 to 25  003 mmolL 97  02 to 102  01 mgdL P  0006 In contrast eucalcemic patients exhibited no change in mean calcium values over the same time period 23  005 to 23  005 mmolL 92  02 to 92  02 mgdL CaCO3 dosage calculated dietary calcium intake and circulating levels of vitamin D metabolites were similar in both groups Physical activity index and predialysis serum bicarbonate levels also were similar in both groups However there was a significant difference in parameters reflecting bone turnover rates between groupsABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R401	In hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin Hb F alpha 2 gamma 2 is elevated after birth Screening of sickle cell patients has revealed a family with elevated Hb F and high A gamma values The propositus was a sickle cell patient with approximately 25 Hb F and 684 A gamma He was heterozygous for the Benin 19 and Mor beta S haplotypes Five AS relatives with the Mor haplotype had 25  09 fetal hemoglobin and 928  28 A gamma whereas two with the Benin haplotype had normal fetal hemoglobin 05 The Mor haplotype is thus associated with the elevated Hb F in this family The 13kilobase kb BgII fragment containing the G gamma and A gamma genes of the Mor haplotype was cloned and the G gamma and A gamma promoters sequenced from 383 to beyond the Cap sites The Mor G gamma gene was normal but the A gamma gene had a unique CT mutation at 202 A different mutation at 202 of G gamma CG was previously detected by other researchers in association with considerably higher Hb F in AS cases 15 to 25 These data suggest either that 202 mutations affect the G gamma and A gamma promoters differently or that different nucleotide substitutions at 202 have divergent effects Alternatively additional unknown mutations could cause the differences in gene expression
R402	To determine if thiopental reduces the incidence of neurologic sequelae after coronary artery surgery we prospectively studied 300 patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting Patients who had no history of neurologic or psychiatric illness were randomly assigned to receive either a thiopental infusion or a saline placebo infusion beginning with the administration of heparin and ending just after aortic decannulation The patients received an opioidrelaxant anesthetic administered by an anesthesiologist who was not involved in this investigation and who was blinded to the test infusion One of the investigators infused either saline or thiopental to produce an isoelectric electroencephalogram with 3045 s between bursts Standardized neurologic examinations were performed preoperatively and on the 2nd and 5th postoperative days by one of the blinded investigators The group of patients receiving thiopental required a longer time for awakening 64  39 vs 40  24 h mean  SD P less than 005 and for tracheal extubation 224  184 vs 174  96 h P less than 005 and a greater number of these patients were lethargic on the 2nd postoperative day More patients receiving thiopental required vasoconstrictors during the thiopental loading and cardiopulmonary bypass CPB periods while a greater number of patients receiving placebo required vasodilators A greater number of patients receiving thiopental required inotropic drugs during separation from CPB Despite the above differences only 2 of the 151 patients in the placebo group 13 and 5 of the 149 patients in the thiopental group 33 experienced strokes P  02535ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R403	Superfused slices of human neocortex prepared from surgically removed tissue to gain access to subcortical tumors and prelabeled selectively with 3Hnorepinephrine NE or 3Hcholine were stimulated electrically to evoke tritium overflow This tritium overflow was abolished by the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin and by withdrawal of extracellular Ca Thus the action potentialinduced exocytotic tritium overflow supports the assumption of a quasiphysiological release of NE from noradrenergic and of acetylcholine ACh from cholinergic nerve terminals respectively In addition the modulation of NE release by adrenoceptor ligands displayed the appropriate pharmacology of alpha2 autoreceptors ACh release was modulated by muscarinic ligands Both NE and ACh release decreased with the age of the patients The effects of drugs on NE and ACh release were not agerelated The peptide modulator of the Ntype voltage sensitive Ca channel omegaconotoxin GVIA inhibited NE release with an IC50 of about 14 nM and ACh release with an IC50 of about 3 nM whereas Ltype modulators were ineffective The binding of 125Iomegaconotoxin GVIA to human neocortical membranes was of high affinity KD  13 pM to one site nH  097 of substantial density maximum binding  878 fmolmg of protein the binding of the Ltype modulator 3Hisradipine to these membranes was also of high affinity KD  89 pM to one site nH  103 of lesser density maximum binding  429 fmolmg of protein In conclusion Ca entry through Ntype Ca channels rather then Ltype Ca channels predominates in subserving NE and ACh release from noradrenergic and cholinergic nerve terminals respectively of human neocortex
R404	Testing for the use of marijuana necessitates one or more levels of assessment depending on the clinical application of the test results The EMITdau screening test with a sensitivity limit of 20 ngml is highly satisfactory for screening for the absence of marijuana in the urine This test has a virtual 100 truenegative rate as long as an unadulterated urine specimen is analyzed Positive results by the EMITdau procedure are presumptive because the test seems to produce falsepositive results when applied to a random population of suspected drug users In a population in a specific clinical environment such as in drugtreatment programs in which 20 of every 100 specimens will yield positive THCCOOH results by EMITdau screening 3 15 of the 20 positive results will likely be falsepositive Our experience with the EMITdau suggests that of 100 test results 3 will be falsepositive an overall 3 falsepositive rate If a positive test result will put the patient in considerable jeopardy and the screening result is the only evidence of drug use confirmatory testing is imperative Of the confirmatory tests GCMS seems to have the specificity necessary to provide a high level of confidence in the results A combination of the EMIT procedure with a sensitivity level of 20 ngml and GCMS confirmation yields virtually 100 accuracy in detection of marijuana abuse
R405	To determine which morphologic features are associated with early death the complete echocardiograms and medical records of 16 consecutive patients with Ebsteins anomaly and concordant atrioventricular connections who presented in the fetal n  5 or neonatal n  11 period were reviewed The cohort was classified into two groups on the basis of survival at 3 months Group 1 consisted of seven patients who died at less than or equal to 3 months of age and Group 2 consisted of the nine surviving patients Comparing Groups 1 and 2 the respective incidence rates of morphologic features that correlated with early death p less than 005 included tethered distal attachments of the anterosuperior tricuspid leaflet 86 versus 11 right ventricular dysplasia 86 versus 0 left ventricular compression by right heart dilation 71 versus 11 and the area of the combined right atrium and atrialized right ventricle being greater than the combined area of the functional right ventricle left atrium and left ventricle 57 versus 0 measured in the apical four chamber view Right ventricular dysplasia was present in all patients with marked right atrial and atrialized right ventricular enlargement in 86 of patients with tethered anterior leaflets and in 83 of those with left ventricular compression 86 of patients with right ventricular dysplasia had tethered distal attachments In conclusion echocardiography defines morphologic features in the fetus and neonate that are highly predictive of death by 3 months of age

R408	The principles of doseresponse and combination chemotherapy were basic to the design of the initial curative standarddose treatment regimens for leukemias lymphomas and testis cancer Agents were selected with different doselimiting toxicities resulting in subadditive toxicity in combination A fourth principle in the design of curative regimens was to combine agents with different mechanisms of action to avoid crossresistance Based on these principles combinations of the highest tolerated doses of active noncrossresistant agents are required to decrease the emergence of drug resistance and achieve optimum cytotoxicity Hematopoietic stemcell support provides a mechanism for significantly increasing the doses of active agents a strategy that has resulted in the cure of 10 to 50 of selected patients with lymphoma who could not be cured with standarddose therapy The lack of sufficiently effective cytoreductive conditioning regimens remains the major impediment to improving the highdose therapy of patients with solid tumors In this study 27 patients with solid tumors were treated with a combination of cyclophosphamide thiotepa and carboplatin CTCb in a phase III study Severe mucositis and neurotoxicity were doselimiting The maximumtolerated dose MTD of the combination was 60 gm2 of cyclophosphamide 500 mgm2 of thiotepa and 800 mgm2 of carboplatin There were two deaths 7 of sepsis and an overall response rate of 72 in refractory tumors 81 in breast cancer CTCb is a combination with low morbidity and high cytoreductive efficacy designed to exploit the principles of curative cancer chemotherapy
R409	The twist is a fundamental geometric property of nucleic acids Calculation of the twist in the most general case requires detailed specification of the threedimensional path of each strand but many important cases may be analyzed by considering only the twist difference If C1 C2 and C3 are three distinct space curves the twist difference about C1 is defined as TwC3 C1  TwC2 C1 We show here that this difference measures the rotation of the correspondence surface joining C1 to C2 about the correspondence surface joining C1 to C3 This result has application to DNA containing local nonuniformities such as denatured regions cruciforms and other altered structures It also facilitates the calculation of twist for threestranded structures including Dloops in mitochondrial DNA and replication and transcription intermediates The twist difference may also be used to simplify greatly the analysis of twist changes in duplex DNA due to winding on surfaces such as histones and certain enzymes In such cases the strandaxis twist of DNA divides into two independent terms The first term arises from the twist of the local reference frame and the second arises from the rotation of either strand about the duplex axis as measured in the local reference frame Twist changes consequent to nucleosome winding for example arise from the twist of the nucleosome axis a straight line about the DNA axis plus the rotation of either strand of the DNA about its axis in the reference frame of the cylinder
R410	Cardiac surgery in 602 children was not preceded by cardiac catheterization the diagnosis being based on clinical findings and twodimensional and Doppler echocardiography In the 355 operations without cardiopulmonary bypass there were nine major and seven minor diagnostic errors 25 and 2 Among the 247 cases with openheart surgery there were no major and eight 32 minor errors The malformations most suitable for nonbypass surgery without catheterization seem to be those with reduced pulmonary blood flow requiring systemicpulmonary artery shunt aortic coarctation and patent ductus arteriosus For openheart surgery without invasive investigation atrial septal defect partial atrioventricular canal aortic and pulmonary stenosis cardiac tumor and isolated valve disorder are classic candidates Recent experience indicated that selected cases of complete atrioventricular canal tetralogy of Fallot truncus arteriosus total anomalous pulmonary venous connection and transposition of the great arteries may safely undergo primary repair without cardiac catheterization Because of its diagnostic potentialities pediatric cardiac surgeons must become familiar with echocardiography
R411	Rabbit antisera directed against a mixture of proteins solubilized from the wildtype adult Caenorhabditis elegans cuticle were used to isolate mutants induced by ethyl methanesulfonate treatment that exhibit alterations in surface antigenicity by immunofluorescence Genetic mapping and complementation data for four such mutations define two genes srf2I and srf3IV The mutant phenotypes observed by immunofluorescence appear to result from unmasking of antigenic determinants that are normally hidden in the wildtype cuticle In support of this hypothesis surface radioiodination experiments indicate that components labeled on the wildtype surface are missing or less readily labeled on the surface of srf2 and srf3 mutants
R412	The status of water and fatsoluble vitamins was prospectively evaluated in 23 patients 13 men 10 women mean age 33  3 yr admitted to the hospital with acute or subacute attacks of inflammatory bowel disease Proteinenergy status was also assessed by means of simultaneous measurement of triceps skinfold thickness midarm muscle circumference and serum albumin Fifteen patients group A had extensive acute colitis ulcerative or Crohns colitis and eight cases group B had small bowel or ileocecal Crohns disease Eightynine healthy subjects 36 men 53 women mean age 34  2 yr acted as controls In both groups of patients the levels of biotin folate betacarotene and vitamins A C and B1 were significantly lower than in controls p less than 001 Plasma levels of vitamin B12 were decreased only in group B p less than 001 whereas riboflavin was lower in group A p less than 001 The percentage of patients at risk of developing hypovitaminosis was 40 or higher for vitamin A betacarotene folate biotin vitamin C and thiamin in both groups of patients Although some subjects had extremely low vitamin values in no case were clinical symptoms of vitamin deficiency observed Only a weak correlation was found between proteinenergy nutritional parameters and vitamin values probably due to the small size of the sample studied The pathophysiological and clinical implications of the suboptimal vitamin status observed in acute inflammatory bowel disease are unknown Further studies on longterm vitamin status and clinical outcome in these patients are necessary
R413	The variability of the valve gradient measured by Doppler in pulmonary stenosis was compared with the variability of the gradient measured at catheterisation in 42 infants and children undergoing catheterisation with a view to balloon dilatation of the pulmonary valve The maximum value measured by Doppler when the patient was unsedated was significantly higher than that measured when the patient was sedated for catheterisation and the maximum gradient was significantly higher shortly after than several days later In a patient with pronounced infundibular obstruction after dilatation the Doppler signal clearly showed that the obstruction was dynamic with a superimposed lower fixed signal that correctly predicted the final low gradient The Doppler gradient in an alert and unsedated patient may be a better measure of the true physiological value The highest Doppler value so obtained is a more appropriate indicator of the need for balloon dilatation than a single catheter measurement The result of dilatation is best assessed by Doppler measurement at least a day after the procedure
R414	The effects of 125 OH2 vitamin D3 on growth of cultured vascular myocytes and on the contractile response of isolated resistance arteries to norepinephrine was examined using tissue derived from 12weekold spontaneously hypertensive SHR and normotensive WistarKyoto WKY rats 125 OH2 vitamin D3 214 pgmL stimulated the growth of superior mesenteric artery myocytes cultured from the SHR and increased the sensitivity of isolated mesenteric resistance arteries to norepinephrine These effects were not observed in tissue of the WKY It is concluded that 125 OH2 vitamin D3 modulates vascular growth and contractility in the SHR but apparently not the WKY Possible mechanisms of action are discussed
R415	A 70yearold woman with multiple symptoms and extensive lymphadenopathy had a lymph node biopsy specimen that contained highly pleomorphic giant ReedSternberg cells that resembled cells from other malignant giant cell neoplasms The cells were strongly positive for LeuM1 alpha 1antitrypsin S100 protein kappa light chain and lambda light chain With five courses of chemotherapy for pathologic stage IVB Hodgkins disease the patient achieved a complete remission and remains free of disease 85 months after diagnosis
R416	Ten male subjects were given alcohol by intravenous infusion and maintained at a constant blood alcohol level The rate of alcohol metabolism was measured before and after an oral dose of fructose 100 g as the amount of alcohol required to maintain the steady state The mean rate of alcohol metabolism increased by 80 after fructose but there was considerable variation among the subjects which was related to their plasma fructose concentrations Blood lactate increased after fructose to a greater degree than blood pyruvate resulting in a significant increase in lactatepyruvate ratio Since fructose increased the lactatepyruvate ratio when it increased alcohol metabolism the action of fructose cannot be explained by a decrease in the liver cytoplasmic NADHNAD ratio and some other mechanism must be sought
R417	A multilaboratory study was conducted to develop a system for standardizing alanine aminotransferase ALT acceptability criteria cutoffs for donated blood Without standardized cutoffs each laboratory must develop its own cutoff and this may not make optimal use of ALT testing to reduce transmission of nonA nonB hepatitis NANB Defining an ALT acceptability criterion in absolute terms is necessary because relative cutoffs based on local donor populations may be affected by the prevalence of NANB in each community This study involved 16 laboratories using 23 different analytic systems The ALT results of the analysis of a plasma reference sample could be used to translate mathematically a single absolute cutoff to units applicable to each analytic system The distribution of ALT results in 14 million donations from across the country was established basing the cutoff on this sample avoids the problems inherent in using a local donor base to establish a cutoff We propose the implementation of a system to standardize ALT acceptability criteria to an activity level defined by analysis of a nationwide donor sample
R418	The antimetabolite 5fluorouracil 5FU was used as adjunctive treatment in glaucomatous eyes with poor prognoses undergoing filtering surgery By adjusting the frequency of postoperative 5FU subconjunctival injections according to the clinical response the author thought it might be possible to reduce episcleral fibroproliferation and maintain a patent filter while reducing complications Sixtythree eyes underwent filtering surgery with subsequent subconjunctival injections of 50 to 75 mg 5FU for 14 days The antimetabolite was not administered if there was evidence of corneal toxicity as demonstrated by epithelial defects or filaments flat anterior chamber or a conjunctival wound leak By adjusting the injections in this fashion the total amount of 5FU administered ranged between 175 and 625 mg 344  116 mg After 1 year successful surgical outcomes were observed in 1315 eyes with aphakia 87 1117 eyes with neovascular glaucoma 65 1112 eyes with at least two previous failed filters 92 and 56 eyes with inflammatory glaucoma 83 Eyes with epithelial downgrowth and cicatrizing diseases of the conjunctiva also were treated Overall conjunctival wound leaks were observed in 24 of the eyes and 29 had detectable changes in their corneal epithelium with corneal defects and filaments Although adjusting the dose of 5FU appears to be safe and effective this can be determined clearly only by a controlled randomized clinical trial
R419	The pulmonary toxicity associated with amiodarone therapy is clinically complex and likely reflects underlying mechanisms of lung injury that result from direct toxic effects of the drug or its metabolites as well as indirect inflammatory and immunologic processes induced by the drug therapy Fig 2 A role for the direct toxicity of the drug is likely because a toxicity in part is related to dosage and duration of therapy b many patients with amiodarone pulmonary toxicity have no evidence of an inflammatory or immune response in the lung c in vitro studies indicate that amiodarone can be directly toxic to cultured lung cells or perfused isolated lung tissue and d recent studies suggest plausible biochemical mechanisms that may explain in part the mechanisms of direct toxicity of the drug A role for indirect inflammatory or immune processes within the lung of some patients with APT is supported by a variable relationship of pulmonary toxicity to amiodarone dosages and blood levels b preliminary studies suggest altered immunologic markers in the blood and lungs of some patients with APT and c the cellular findings of bronchoalveolar lavage indicating a CD8 lymphocytosis with or without influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes which is consistent with previous studies of hypersensitivity reactions As our understanding of the biochemical and cellular mechanisms of APT improve a number of key clinical issues may be clarified 1 risk factor assessment for APT 2 criteria for early diagnosis of APT and 3 improved therapeutic approach to patients with APT
R420	The present study was designed to investigate the changes in gastric mucosal PGI2 level accompanying the healing of acetic acidinduced gastric ulcers in rats The ulcers which were observed with an endoscope were found to undergo periods of decrease healing and exacerbation during the rats lifetime The phases were categorized as follows 1 the reduction period days 350 after ulcer induction corresponding to 714 weeks of age 2 healing period days 35150 after ulcer induction corresponding to 1229 weeks of age 3 first exacerbation period days 35231 after ulcer induction corresponding to 1240 weeks of age 4 inactive period days 231365 after ulcer induction corresponding to 4060 weeks of age and 5 second exacerbation period days 365550 after ulcer induction corresponding to 6086 weeks of age In normal rats the level of gastric mucosal PGI2 gradually increased with aging between 7 and 20 weeks then decreased up to 40 weeks The PGI2 level in the 60weekold rat did not differ from that in the 40weekold rat The PGI2 level was the lowest in the 86weekold rat In ulcerbearing rats the PGI2 level showed the same pattern of change as that in normal rats but the level was higher The above results indicated a marked decrease in PGI2 level between 20 and 40 weeks of age and between 60 and 86 weeks of age in normal and ulcerbearing rats These periods corresponded closely to the first and second exacerbation periods respectivelyABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R421	Complications involving the colon occurred in 28 of 325 patients who received renal transplants Pseudomembranous colitis the most common complication affected 15 patients two of whom required surgery Three instances of diverticulitis were complicated by free perforation in two cases and by colovesical fistula in one Appendicitis occurred in two cases The other complications were hemorrhage from diverticulosis or angiodysplasia nonspecific colitis and ischemic colitis Spontaneous colonic perforation did not occur Two thirds of the colonic complications occurred within 30 days after transplantation All cases of colon perforation however occurred later than one month after transplantation It is concluded that pseudomembranous colitis is the most common colonic complication in renal transplant recipients that it usually occurs early and that it carries a good prognosis Colonic perforations occurred later in this series and were treated successfully All cases of ischemic colitis were part of terminal multiorgan system failure
R422	The data presented herein indicate that IgE synthesis results from a complex interaction between T cells B cells and monocytes under the control of T cellderived and monocytederived lymphokines IL4 IL5 and IL6 In addition to their direct effects on IgE synthesis these lymphokines have other functions many of which are related to IgE IL4 is not only a crucial signal for the induction of IgE synthesis but also a growth factor for murine mast cells together with IL3 a product of the same T cell clones Furthermore IL4 is a potent inducer of Fc epsilon R2b expression on both B cells and monocytes On the other hand IL4secreting T cells also produce IL5 which promotes B cell maturation and induces differentiation of eosinophil precursors Eosinophils in turn express CD23 when activated thus the activation of the IgE system leads to increased IgE synthesis and to enhanced expression of Fc epsilon R1 on mast cells and Fc epsilon R2 on B cells monocytes and eosinophils This in turn results in increased receptorligand interactions with release of different chemical mediators involved in the pathogenesis of allergy Such considerations suggest that the regulation of IgE synthesis should be viewed in the wider context of the IgE system a multicomponent network in which different cell types are functionally integrated mainly through lymphokinemediated signalsABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R423	We conducted disability and mortality studies to determine if the male preponderance usually found in Parkinsons disease PD was reflected in different courses of the diseases in the 2 sexes We analyzed longitudinal disability score in 47 men and 23 women with PD followed for 6 years at UCLA We found no significant differences between the sexes in mean disability scores in any of the 6 years Mean dopa dosage was significantly higher in men possibly reflecting their generally larger body mass Choreoathetosis dementia or other side effects did not differ between the 2 groups We obtained observed to expected mortality ratios in 239 men and 132 women followed for 3831 personyears from records of 4 medical centers Using the sexspecific US Life Tables to calculate expected mortality we found the observed to expected ratio for the men was 17457 and for the women 24740 a significantly greater excess in female mortality Analyses of mortality using tables which are not sexspecific will fail to uncover the decreased longevity in women with PD We conclude that despite the male preponderance in PD men and women acquire it at the same age have the same progression and duration of disease and die at the same age whereas in the general population women have a longer life expectancy than men It is not known what factors protect women from incurring PD and what lowers their life expectancy to that of men when they do have the disease
R424	Our understanding of the pathophysiology of allergic rhinitis is increasing as a result of the development of new research tools for investigation of patients with this disorder The pharmacologic treatment of allergic rhinitis has been greatly improved by introduction of relatively nonsedating H1receptor antagonists and potent topically active glucocorticosteroids Immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis is also changing with the times Patient selection criteria are becoming more strict and the introduction of safer modified allergens with decreased allergenicity and retained immunogenicity will be a major advance
R425	In 34 studies on six upright anesthetized sheep central venous pressure from sites in the upper and lower superior vena cava SVC was recorded before during and after the injection into a neck vein of 1ml increments of air every minute for 15 min After the injection of air the pressure recorded from the upper site increased significantly This increase was the result of air collecting in the SVC with a consequent loss or partial loss of the SVC hydrostatic pressure difference The time of onset and the duration of collection were not influenced by hyper or hypovolemia nor by 1 kPa positive endexpiratory pressure The readily identifiable change in the venous pressure in the upper SVC provided an earlier and more reliable warning of these smallvolume air emboli than did a Doppler probe directed at the right side of the heart
R426	An analysis was performed of malignant and host cells found in peritoneal fluids obtained during intraperitoneal chemotherapy and immunotherapy in patients with ovarian cancer The concentration of malignant cells and the surgically documented response to the intraperitoneal treatment were correlated Twentythree patients were treated with intraperitoneal cisplatin or alpha2 interferon rIFNalpha 2 after persistent carcinoma was documented at secondlook laparotomy Six patients 26 had a complete response to therapy and all of these patients had a malignant cell concentration of less than 102cellscm2dL No responses were seen in patients whose initial malignant cell concentration was greater than 103cellscm2dL Among patients treated with intraperitoneal alphainterferon five of 11 whose initial concentration of malignant cells was less than 102 cellscm2dL responded to therapy whereas none of the patients whose malignant cell concentration was 102 cellscm2dL or greater responded In patients treated with intraperitoneal cisplatin the initial concentration of malignant cells associated with any surgically documented response was less than 103cellscm2dL A host mesothelial reaction was prominent after intraperitoneal alphainterferon but not observed in women treated with intraperitoneal cisplatin The fluctuating pattern of peritoneal white blood cells documented during therapy did not correlate with response THe evaluation of peritoneal cytology specimens during intraperitoneal chemotherapy should include a quantitative assessment of malignant cells and reactive mesothelial cells in order to reflect more accurately the histologically documented findings Initial quantitative cytology appears to correlate with the likelihood of a surgically documented response to intraperitoneal therapy
R427	NG monomethylLarginine LNMMA a specific inhibitor of the synthesis of endotheliumderived nitric oxide NO was infused into the brachial arteries of healthy volunteers to study the role of NO in the control of forearm blood flow LNMMA caused a 50 fall in basal blood flow and attenuated the dilator response to infused acetylcholine but not that to glyceryl trinitrate These results indicate that the dilator action of endotheliumderived NO contributes to the control of basal and stimulated regional blood flow in man Impairment of production of NO might account for the abnormalities in vascular reactivity that characterise a wide variety of disease states
R428	A representative group of middleaged 45 to 64yrold patients with noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus NIDDM n  133 70 men 63 women were examined at the time of diagnosis and 5 yr afterward for metabolic control and insulin response to oral glucose 144 nondiabetic control subjects 62 men 82 women were similarly examined twice between 5yr intervals At the 5yr examination 56 of the diabetic patients 36 men 20 women were on diet therapy only 60 27 men 33 women received oral antidiabetic drugs and 5 were treated with insulin The metabolic control of diabetic patients was poor at the time of diagnosis and 5yr examination Fasting plasma insulin levels were higher in diabetic patients than in control subjects both at baseline 23  2 vs 14  1 mUL P less than 001 for men 26  2 vs 15  1 mUL NS for women and 5yr examination 19  1 vs 16  2 mUL NS for men 29  5 vs 15  1 mUL P less than 005 for women The frequency of insulin deficiency in diabetic patients based on a postglucagon 1 mg iv Cpeptide level less than 060 nM was 33 at the 5yr examination indicating that true insulin deficiency was uncommon during the first years after diagnosis of diabetes in middleaged subjects
R429	Using immunohistochemical methods the authors studied the expression of panT and majorityTcell antigens CD5 CD2 CD3 TCRbeta CD7 and Tcell subset antigens CD4 CD8 in cutaneous T cells in mycosis fungoides MF 177 biopsies from 124 patients and a variety of inflammatory lesions 45 biopsies from 45 patients The authors detected the absence of panT or majorityTcell antigens or of both Tcell subset antigens from T cells in the epidermis but not the dermis in 15 MF biopsies 8 from 11 MF patients 9 but in none of the inflammatory skin lesions The opposite picture characterized by lack of antigen expression by the dermal T cells only was not seen in any of the MF or inflammatory lesions The absence of antigen expression by epidermal but not dermal T cells which the authors have termed antigen discordance was most prevalent for CD5 CD7 and TCRbeta each being discordant in 6 to 7 of MF cases or patients tested Among the MF biopsies showing antigen discordance 14 of 15 biospies 93 from 10 of 11 patients 91 were discordant for two or more antigens Antigen discordance was not an artifact of treatment because none of the patients showing discordance was receiving treatment at the time of their initial discordant biopsy The discordance was the only immunophenotypic abnormality detected in 8 of 15 53 of the discordant MF biopsies Thus this antigen discordance was an important diagnostic feature that allowed the immunophenotypic distinction of MF from a variety of inflammatory skin lesions

R431	We evaluated the effect of a selective thromboxane synthetase inhibitor TSI on the patency of autogenous vein grafts in dogs Treatment involved oral dosing 10 mgkg bid of TSI or placebo combined with local treatment of the graft with TSI or placebo papavarine at the time of implantation At harvest two animals one from each oral dosing group had an occluded graft both grafts had been locally treated with papavarine We found no significant histopathologic difference between graft treatment groups Attempts to estimate the effect of TSI dosing on the prostacyclinthromboxane balance through radioimmunoassay analysis of graft perfusates were unsuccessful As measured by in vitro platelet aggregation oral TSI was found to alter platelet function though not in a dosedependent fashion and the animals rebounded toward normal at 12 hours
R432	Most patients with disseminated nonseminomatous germ cell tumor NSGCT have an excellent prognosis with modern chemotherapy although certain subgroups with a worse prognosis have been described One such subgroup includes patients with high serum levels of the tumor marker human chorionic gonadotropin HCG Sixteen patients of 104 treated for NSGCT at the CRC Wessex Medical Oncology Unit Southampton UK presented with serum HCG greater than 25000 Most of these patients exhibited features of the choriocarcinoma syndrome with bulky rapidly progressive disease frequent pulmonary hepatic and central nervous system complications and a generally poorer response to standard NSGCT chemotherapy Histologic identification of trophoblastic tumor was not made in all patients and is not essential for the diagnosis of the syndrome indeed closed biopsy may be contradicted in some circumstances because of the risk of hemorrhage The NSGCT patients with poor prognosis including patients with the choriocarcinoma syndrome must be clearly identified in order to improve management and eventually cure rates
R433	Psoriasis is a common papulosquamous skin disease The histopathology is characterized by epidermal hyperplasia and inflammation Recent studies suggest that keratinocyte proliferation and inflammation in psoriasis are manifestations of the same underlying pathological process Interleukin 6 IL6 a cytokine that is a major mediator of the host response to tissue injury and infection is produced by both keratinocytes and leukocytes in culture IL6 expression was studied in psoriatic plaques by immunoperoxidase staining with two different polyclonal antirecombinant IL6 antisera and by in situ nucleic acid hybridization with IL6 cRNA probes Epidermal and dermal cells in active psoriatic plaques from 35 psoriasis patients stained heavily for IL6 as compared with nonlesional skin and with plaques after treatment with antimetabolic and antiinflammatory agents Absorption of the antirecombinant IL6 antisera with purified fibroblastderived IL6 or with recombinant IL6 but not bovine serum albumin removed the immunostaining Increased levels of IL6 were detected in the plasma of patients with active psoriasis mean 3 ngml by using two different bioassays IL6 production by proliferating keratinocytes was suggested by IL6specific immunostaining in cultured normal and psoriatic keratinocytes and by the detection of mRNA specific for IL6 in psoriatic epidermis by in situ hybridization IL6 stimulated the proliferation of cultured normal human keratinocytes as assessed by two different assays Thus IL6 could directly contribute to the epidermal hyperplasia seen in psoriatic epithelium as well as affect the function of dermal inflammatory cells
R434	A hospitalbased casecontrol study on the possible relationship between cholecystectomy and colon cancer is described In all 569 cases and 1129 controls were included in the study Controls were patients who had been admitted either with another malignant disease lung cancer or breast cancer or because of benign gastrointestinal diseases No differences with regard to colon cancer risk were observed between the two control groups The crude odds ratio OR after cholecystectomy for colon cancer was 21 95 CL confidence limits  15 29 No significant difference in risk between males OR  20 95 CL  11 36 and females OR  21 95 CL  14 32 was found A significant inverse relationship was found between the relative risk for colon cancer and sublocalization of the colon cancer the highest relative risk RR found proximal in the colon A decreasing risk with increasing interval between cholecystectomy and date of diagnosis of colon cancer was found It is hypothesized that the apparent association between cholecystectomy and colon cancer does not reflect a necessary causeeffect relationship but is rather an epiphenomenon representing a diminished exposure level to other etiologic factors
R435	Insulinstimulated kinase activity of adipocytederived insulin receptors is reduced in subjects with noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus NIDDM but normal in obese nondiabetics To assess the reversibility of the kinase defect in NIDDM insulin receptor kinase activity was measured before and after weight loss in 10 NIDDM and 5 obese nondiabetic subjects Peripheral insulin action was also assessed in vivo by glucose disposal rates GDR measured during a hyperinsulinemic 300 mUM2 per min euglycemic clamp In the NIDDMs insulin receptor kinase activity was reduced by 5080 and rose to approximately 6590 P less than 001 of normal after 132  20 kg P less than 001 weight loss comparable weight loss 182  15 kg P less than 001 in the nondiabetics resulted in no significant change in insulin receptor kinase activity Relative to GDR measured in lean nondiabetics GDR in the NIDDMs was 35 of normal initially and 67 P less than 001 of normal after diet therapy weight loss in the nondiabetics resulted in an increase in GDR from 53 to 76 of normal P less than 005 These results indicate that the insulin receptor kinase defect that is present in NIDDM is largely reversible after weight reduction In contrast the improvement in GDR in the absence of any change in insulin receptor kinase activity in the nondiabetics suggests that the main cause of insulin resistance in obesity lies distal to the kinase
R436	The effects of ketamine and morphine on pain perception and catalepsy were compared in rats Analgesia as measured by the latency to withdrawal of the tail from a 55 degrees C water bath tailflick latency difference TFLD was produced by both ketamine and morphine but at widely different doses and in each case the effect was reversed by naloxone Catalepsy measured by the duration of loss of righting reflex DLRR in catatonic animals was induced by larger doses of both ketamine and morphine and in each case was reduced by a larger dose of naloxone DLRR and TFLD tolerance developed rapidly and with a similar time course after daily doses of ketamine or morphine Rats tolerant to the DLRR effect of ketamine showed crosstolerance to morphine Rats tolerant to the DLRR effect of morphine did not show crosstolerance to ketamine when administered the following day instead these rats showed potentiation of the ketamineinduced DLRR The degree of potentiation noted 24 hr after a single or multiple daily doses of 45 mgkg of morphine is the same as that seen when 2 mgkg of morphine is given simultaneously with ketamine The residual brain level of morphine 24 hr after 45 mgkg is similar to the level 1 hr after a 2mgkg dose The augmented ketamine response in morphinetolerant rats is postulated to be a result of residual morphine still present in the brain 24 hr after the last DLRRinducing dose of morphineABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R437	The role of hepatitis C virus HCV in posttransfusion nonA nonB hepatitis NANBH was investigated by analysing clinical samples for both HCV RNA by cDNApolymerase chain reaction and antibodies against C1003 by radioimmunoassay Of fifteen chronic NANBH patients and one patient with chronic cryptogenic liver disease ten were positive for antiC1003 and seven of the ten had viral sequences in their livers However two patients negative for antiC1003 also had substantial levels of HCV RNA in their livers In acute posttransfusion NANBH one surgical patient and two experimentally infected chimpanzees HCV RNA was detected in the absence of antiC1003 In addition infectious plasma from a seronegative patient with acute posttransfusion NANBH and a seronegative pool of plasma from a chimpanzee with chronic posttransfusion NANBH had high levels of HCV These findings show that antiC1003positive patients with chronic posttransfusion NANBH are likely to be viraemic confirm that antibodies to C1003 are a marker for infectivity and suggest that the prevalence of HCV infections may be underestimated from the frequency of antibodies to C1003 alone
R438	The thin afferent nerves were tested quantitatively by determining the thresholds of warmth and pricking pain to argon laser stimulation and by measuring the brain potentials related to pricking pain In 27 patients with electrophysiologically verified carpal tunnel syndrome these parameters were measured from fingers 3 and 5 on both hands All patients had had sensory symptoms ranging from 3 months to 25 years Both the thresholds were elevated P less than 005 at finger 3 compared to measurements from finger 5 and compared to finger 3 in a group of 39 controls Four patients with symptoms for more than 7 years had thresholds below the control values The power of the painevoked brain potentials elicited from finger 3 was lower P less than 005 compared to finger 5 and compared to the control group P less than 001 No correlations were found between the measured parameters and the clinical electrophysiological investigation The findings support previous assumptions that chronic lowforce compressions cause impairment of intraneural microcirculation and hence can affect the function of the thin afferents
R439	Twentyone patients 12 to 18 years of age with nocturnal asthma controlled with sustainedrelease theophylline administered twice daily were enrolled in a 10week doubleblind twoway crossover study that compared TheoDur tablets administered twice daily with an equivalent daily dose of Uniphyl tablets administered once daily at bedtime Seventeen patients completed the study The mean morning theophylline serum level obtained with Uniphyl tablets was significantly higher than that obtained with TheoDur tablets 131 versus 96 microgramsml p  002 The mean evening serum level was significantly lower with Uniphyl tablets 63 versus 101 microgramsml p  0003 Despite these differences in serum concentrations morning and evening pulmonary function test values forced expiratory volume in one second and peak expiratory flow rate and symptom scores were nearly identical for the two preparations as was the supplemental use of aerosol bronchodilators Oncedaily dosing with Uniphyl tablets may benefit adolescent patients with nocturnal asthma by increasing compliance and providing better asthma control In addition the lower daytime theophylline levels produced by this preparation may also reduce longterm adverse effects on behavior and cognition
R440	Prominent features of moyamoya disease are fibrocellular thickening of the intima and enhanced angiogenesis The pathogenesis of moyamoya disease is however unknown Basic fibroblast growth factor FGF is an angiogenic factor as well as a potent mitogen for a number of cell types including vascular endothelial and smoothmuscle cells In order to test the possibility that basic FGF takes part in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease the authors tested for the presence of this factor using a mouse monoclonal antibody against human recombinant basic FGF The surgical specimens studied included two sections of the superficial temporal artery STA and four samples of dura mater from four patients with moyamoya disease Surgical specimens were obtained from three patients with other diseases as control tissue Sections of the STA obtained from the patients with moyamoya disease showed strong basic FGF immunoreactivity in endothelial and smoothmuscle cells while control sections had only faint and scattered immunoreactivity All sections of the dura mater obtained from the patients with moyamoya disease also revealed more intense immunohistochemical staining of basic FGF in meningeal and vascular cells than did control sections These observations indicate that the amount of basic FGF is increased in the tissues of patients with moyamoya disease thus basic FGF may play an important role in the pathogenesis of moyamoya disease

R443	Serial haemodynamic investigations were performed in 15 women delivered by elective caesarean section under epidural anaesthesia at 3840 weeks gestation Cardiac output was measured by Doppler and crosssectional echocardiography at the aortic valve No haemodynamic changes were demonstrable after attainment of surgical anaesthesia T5 or above Stroke volume increased 13 after delivery of the placenta and remained elevated until the end of the operation at which time cardiac output was 11 above preoperative values Stroke volume and cardiac output fell during the first postoperative day Heart rate remained elevated at preoperative values for 48 h after delivery There was a fall in heart rate and cardiac output between the second and the sixth days after delivery By 2 weeks after delivery cardiac output was 28 lower than preoperative values Compared with preoperative values diastolic blood pressure was lower on the first and second postnatal days
R444	This article reviews some of the important physical principles involved in Doppler ultrasound US in the context of modern diagnostic US technology Methods of quantitative Doppler US data analysis used to distinguish normal hemodynamics from disturbed flow conditions are discussed with the aid of numerous examples Definitions and measurement techniques are presented for determining from Doppler signals such indicators of arterial disease as velocity volume flow rate flow impedance and pulsatility Spectral analysis and its utility in Doppler signal analysis are described The various options available on modern Doppler US instrumentation are reviewed including duplex Doppler techniques and color Doppler flow mapping Finally the authors discuss artifacts and pitfalls likely to be encountered in the routine clinical use of Doppler US for diagnostic purposes
R445	A recent report measured a decrease in plasma ACTH concentration by immunoradiometric assay IRMA during infusion of ACTH124 in humans It was concluded that this decrease in ACTH concentration was due to short loop ACTH autoregulation The present study demonstrates that the decrease in ACTH concentration measured by IRMA was due to an artifact of the IRMA We injected 250 micrograms ACTH124 iv into five normal male volunteers after overnight 25g metyrapone administration The ACTH concentration measured by IRMA decreased from 596  97 pmolL before to 48  20 pmolL 1 min after ACTH124 injection The ACTH concentration measured by IRMA increased thereafter in a mirror image of the decline in ACTH124 measured by RIA Addition of ACTH124 to plasma in vitro resulted in a decrease in the ACTH concentration measured by IRMA which was of similar magnitude to that observed in vivo ACTH124 infusion in vivo or addition to ACTH139containing plasma in vitro decreased ACTH139 measured by IRMA by binding to N but not Cterminal antibody without forming a detectable sandwich complex We conclude that although ACTH short loop feedback may exist it cannot be detected after ACTH124 injection with the use of a twosite IRMA
R446	The role of schistosomes in the pathologenesis of acute appendicitis in an endemic area was investigated Of 1600 appendicectomies received in our laboratory 26 showed appendiceal schistosomiasis which prompted what we believe to be the first detailed histopathological evaluation of all appendices with schistosomal infestation without prior knowledge of the clinical and operative diagnoses The results suggest that there are two types of schistosomal appendicitis each with distinct clinicopathological features and different pathogenetic mechanisms They could be called obstructive and granulomatous schistosomal acute appendicitis respectively
R447	A 23dayold infant presented with apnea and was found to have Citrobacter diversus meningitis and brain abscess The organism persisted in brain abscess fluid for over 4 weeks despite adequate antibiotic therapy Cranial computed tomography demonstrated persistent radiolucencies in both frontal lobes and midline shift long after completion of antibiotic therapy Effective therapy of C diversus meningitis and brain abscess may require use of an antibiotic active within phagocytes and judicious surgical drainage A high prevalence of brain abscess mandates cranial computed tomography for any infant with C diversus meningitis
R448	Gap junctions in the early amphibian embryo may play a fundamental role in the regulation of differentiation by mediating the celltocell transfer of chemical signals A complementary DNA encoding a gap junction present in Xenopus oocytes and early embryos has now been cloned and sequenced This protein sequence is homologous to the wellcharacterized gap junction structural proteins rat connexin32 and connexin43 RNA blot analysis of total Xenopus oocyte RNA showed hybridization to a single 16kilobase band This messenger RNA is abundant in oocytes decreases to levels below the sensitivity of our assay by stage 15 18 hours and is not detectable in RNA from a number of adult organs To confirm that the oocyte cDNA encodes a gap junction channel the protein was over expressed in Xenopus oocytes by injection of RNA synthesized in vitro Pairs of RNAinjected oocytes formed many more time and voltagesensitive cellcell channels than waterinjected pairs
R449	One of the potentially troublesome sequelae of limb amputations is the development of stump neuromas at the severed ends of major nerves The ability to define them and to distinguish them from other causes of stump pain is of considerable clinical significance Computed tomography was performed on ten lower limb amputees with stump pain Five patients had neuromas that were manifest as focal or generalized alteration in the caliber size or contour of the nerve trunk in the affected stump The remaining five patients each had an abnormality detected these abnormalities included heterotopic bone formation popliteal artery aneurysm lipoma scar tissue and abscess in the contralateral limb
R450	A humoral cytotoxic protein that is spontaneously produced by a cloned human lymphoblastoid cell line K160b was partially purified by a simple threestep column chromatography procedure and NaDodSO4polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis Proteins were electrically blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and a band of the cytotoxic protein was excised after staining with Coomassie brilliant blue Direct analysis of the amino acid sequence of this protein showed the primary structure of its Nterminal region was identical to that of natural tumor necrosis factor type beta TNFbeta The 24kDa molecular mass of the cytotoxic protein determined by NaDodSO4PAGE and its elution profiles from various types of columns correlated with those of natural TNFbeta Specific activity of the cytotoxicity standardized with recombinant TNFbeta was comparable to that of the purified factor However polyclonal antiserum to recombinant TNFbeta failed to react with the purified factor Since recombinant TNFbeta when used in patients causes unacceptable side effects which may be due to absence of glycosylation the cell line K160b could be a useful source of natural TNFbeta for clinical trials

R452	Normal salivary function is considered to be critical for the maintenance of healthy oral mucosa However few studies have examined mucosal changes in patients with objectively documented salivary gland performance In the present report the mucosal status of 298 subjects being evaluated in a dry mouth clinic was assessed A complete oral examination was performed and unstimulated and stimulated salivary samples were collected separately from the parotid and submandibularsublingual glands Data were analyzed according to diagnosis and salivary output after the assignment of an oral mucosal rating to each subject In general the mucosal surfaces were well preserved and infections were not seen Patients evaluated for Sjogrens syndrome and radiationinduced xerostomia had the lowest salivary gland performance but displayed a mucosal status similar to denturewearing healthy subjects or patients with normal salivary flow who had idiopathic xerostomia However those patients with a total lack of salivary flow rarely had normalappearing oral mucosa These results confirm a role for saliva in oral mucosal preservation and also suggest that other factors may act to maintain oral mucosal integrity
R453	To determine the best method of preventing ascending infection in the management of premature rupture of membranes antibiotics such as latamoxef sodium cefoperazone sodium and cefotaxime sodium were infused directly into the amniotic cavity in 64 patients undergoing induction of labor at term A single infusion of 100 or 500 mg of each drug resulted in a concentration of 200 to 1000 microgramsml immediately after infusion and the concentration remained above 10 microgramsml for about 24 hours without significant increase in fetal or maternal blood levels Consequently a daily single dose of 100 mg or more is probably effective prophylaxis in cases of premature rupture of membranes When intrauterine infection is suspected the dose can be increased to 500 mg or more and transplacental administration may be added to achieve a higher concentration in fetal blood The present study simulates well premature rupture of membranes and an amnioinfusion of antibiotics will be reliable and effective in managing premature rupture of membranes
R454	To investigate the cerebral hemodynamic changes associated with obliteration of arteriovenous malformations AVMs we studied 26 patients undergoing total microsurgical AVM resection during isoflurane and N2O2 anesthesia Detectors were placed 5 to 6 cm from the margin of the lesion and in a homologous contralateral position Cerebral blood flow CBF was measured using the intravenous xenon133 technique before and after AVM resection during both hypocapnia and normocapnia at each stage Intraoperative changes in CBF were related to a risk score system based on the patients history and preoperative angiograms Seven otherwise healthy patients undergoing spinal surgery were studied to control for anesthetic effects Patient demographic and clinical data for the AVM group conformed to the expected strata of a large AVM population The CBF increased after excision 22  1 ml100 gmin before excision to 30  2 ml100 gmin after excision mean  SE n  25 P less than 0002 without a hemispheric difference CO2 reactivity increased slightly after excision 42  03 changemm Hg before excision to 47  03 changemm Hg after excision n  14 P less than 002 The baseline CBF and CO2 reactivity were not different from the control group There was a weak correlation between the risk score and the percentage of change in the ipsilateral CBF with a trend for the patients with the lowest risk to have the lowest CBF changes after resection There was no relationship between CO2 reactivity and risk grade None of the patients awoke from anesthesia with unexpected neurological deficits The highest CBF increases were associated with postoperative brain swelling in one patient and fatal intracerebral hemorrhage in another Both patients had normal CO2 reactivity before excision One patient suffered postoperative intracerebral hemorrhage attributable to technical problems and had no increase in CBF We conclude that with an acute increase in the arteriovenous pressure gradient and cerebral perfusion pressure that results from shunt obliteration there is an immediate global effect of AVM resection to increase CBF Cerebrovascular reactivity to CO2 remains intact both before and after excision
R455	We studied 74 patients with progressive asymmetrical lower motor neuron syndromes Clinical features of these patients including age sex disease duration patterns of weakness and reflex changes were evaluated by review of records In each patient the clinical features were compared to the type of nerve conduction abnormalities and to the specificities of hightiter serum antiglycolipid antibodies Antibody specificities were determined by an enzymelinked immunosorbent assay using purified glycolipids and carbohydrates as substrates Our results show that high titers of antibodies to glycolipids are common in sera of patients with lower motor neuron syndromes Selective patterns of reactivity indicate that specific carbohydrate epitopes on the glycolipids are the targets of the hightiter antibodies in individual patients with lower motor neuron syndromes Several distinct lower motor neuron syndromes can be identified based on clinical physiological and antiglycolipid antibody characteristics These syndromes include multifocal motor neuropathy with evidence of multifocal conduction block on motor but not sensory axons and frequent 84 high titers of antiGM1 ganglioside antibodies a lower motor neuron syndrome with predominantly distal weakness early in the disease course no conduction block and a high incidence 64 of antiGM1 antibodies and a lower motor neuron syndrome with predominant early weakness in proximal muscles and serum antibodies to asialoGM1 that do not crossreact with GM1 ganglioside
R456	Basement membranes found around tumor cells in nevocytic nevi Spitzs nevi and malignant melanomas were analyzed by electron microscopy and antibody staining for several basement membrane proteins Nevocytic nevi and Spitzs nevi showed a distinct occasionally discontinuous lamina densa regardless of whether they were located in junctional zones of the epidermis or within the dermis All basement membranes around nests of aggregated nevus cells however lacked anchoring fibrils This correlated with the absence of type VII collagen In contrast type IV collagen laminin and nidogen were present at the periphery of the nevus cell clusters in agreement with the presence of an intact lamina densa Aggregated tumor cells in malignant melanomas were bordered by a lamina densa when located in a junctional position and lacked this structure when they had migrated into the dermis This process was accompanied by a drastically reduced staining for collagen type IV and nidogen whereas laminin was still detectable Anchoring fibrils and their molecular correlate type VII collagen were consistently absent These observations demonstrate major alterations in the composition of basement membranes around malignant melanomas which can be an important factor for the invasive growth and formation of metastases of these tumors

R458	The purpose of this work was to investigate the mechanisms involved in the peculiar biphasic response of the lamb urethral smooth muscle to high K solutions The relative amplitude of the phasic and tonic components of the contraction and its reproducibility were dependent on the concentration of K used Only concentrations higher than 80 mM ie 120 mM showed a tonic component greater in amplitude than the phasic one and manifested a tachyphylactic effect Phentolamine 106 M prazosin 106 M and chemical denervation with 6hydroxydopamine significantly inhibited the tonic component of the K 120 mMinduced contraction modifying its morphology Reproducible contractions to K 120 mM could be obtained in the presence of prazosin 106 M or cocaine 106 M The preparations were also shown to accumulate 3Hnoradrenaline and release it upon depolarization with K 60 and 120 mM Calcium removal inhibited the K 120 mMinduced contraction After addition of calcium 055 mM the contractile activity was restored Nifedipine 106 M and verapamil 106 M but not sodium nitroprusside 106 M significantly blocked the contractile response for calcium as well as the phasic component of the K contraction in calciumcontaining medium In preparations treated with prazosin 106 M the tonic component of the K 120 mM contraction was more sensitive to nifedipine and removal of extracellular calcium than the phasic oneABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R459	The effects of aspirin acetylsalicylate ASA and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs NSAIDs on renal prostaglandin PG biosynthesis and function have been studied extensively In contrast the in vivo effects of a nonacetylated salicylate SA such as sodium SA on renal function have not been well characterized No studies have examined the effects of SA on renal function in a situation in which the maintenance of normal kidney function is dependent upon intact renal PG synthesis ie sodium restrictionelevated plasma renin activity To evaluate the effects of SA vs ASA andor a NSAID normal and sodiumrestricted anesthetized dogs were treated with SA and then meclofenamate MECLO or ASA followed by MECLO In the normal animals SA significantly decreased renal PGE2 and PGF2 alpha excretion After SA a significant amount of MECLOsuppressible PGE2 and PGF2 alpha synthesis remained intact Compared to SA with ASA there was a greater decrease in PG excretion with no further decrease in PG excretion with subsequent MECLO treatment In the sodiumrestricted animals plasma renin activity 1824 ng of angiotensin lmlhr ASA decreased PGE2 excretion but SA did not In these animals SA did not cause renal vasoconstriction Additional groups of sodiumrestricted animals were studied with extremely high doses of ASA and SA 90 mgkg to elevate plasma SA to 200 to 250 microgramsml In these animals SA did decrease PGE2 excretion significantly but only to levels seen typically in normal animals and after SA a large amount of PGE2 excretion could be suppressed by MECLOABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS

R461	Between 1979 and 1988 a total of 53 infants less than 1 year of age underwent repair of coarctation Thirtyseven patients 70 were younger than 3 months Median age was 09 month Four different surgical techniques were used resection with endtoend anastomosis patch enlargement subclavian flap aortoplasty and subclavian displacement aortoplasty MeierMendonca technique Hospital mortality was 75 and was limited to patients with additional complex intracardiac defects Neither age nor surgical technique had an influence on the operative risk Followup averaged 15 to 43 months for the four different groups Restenosis developed in 9 19 of 47 patients regularly followed up 5 11 of whom have had reoperation Age at operation was not a predictor for restenosis which occurred in 174 of patients less than 1 month and 208 of those greater than 1 month of age at operation Patch enlargement and the subclavian displacement technique demonstrated the highest restenosis rates 42 and 43 respectively However patients who underwent patch enlargement had less favorable pathological conditions It is concluded that results of coarctation repair in early infancy do not depend as much on the operative method itself as on the specific pathological aspect which largely determines the method of treatment Some reservation must be made in regard to the subclavian displacement technique
R462	Traditional therapy for malignant pleural effusions includes thoracentesis or tube drainage with instillation of irritants to achieve pleurodesis This can require a lengthy hospitalization causes pain and discomfort and has an appreciable failure rate Because of these drawbacks the authors used a shunting device to transfer fluid to the peritoneal cavity in 17 patients with malignant pleural effusions Eleven patients had undergone previous therapeutic thoracenteses and three had chest tube placement with failed sclerosis The shunt was a subcutaneous valved pump chamber with attached pleural and peritoneal catheters which used manual compression to transfer fluid against the normal abdominalpleural pressure gradient Operative placement under local or general anesthesia was performed without complication Five patients achieved minimal benefit either because of moribund status or their inability to compress the pump effectively In the other 12 patients there was radiographic evidence of diminished or stabilized pleural effusion respiratory symptoms were effectively palliated and no further treatment for their effusion was required Peritoneal dissemination of malignant cells has not been clinically detected We feel that pleuroperitoneal shunting is a valid new method for treatment of malignant pleural effusions which can effectively palliate respiratory symptoms with low morbidity Advantages include the absence of external tubing and the possibility for only a short hospitalization or even outpatient placement Shunting is applicable for patients who are able to perform the requisite pumping and is particularly suitable for those with trapped lungs or who have failed attempted pleural sclerosis
R463	Serum beta2 microglobulin B2M levels were studied in 365 breast cancer patients and 210 agematched controls The patients were divided into three groups Group A new patients at diagnosis Group B patients at followup and Group C metastatic patients The mean B2M of all breast cancer patients plus or minus one standard deviation 35  12 range 11 to 59 was significantly higher than normal controls 129  049 range 03 to 23 P less than 0005 When the three patient groups were compared with each other the mean B2M level of Group A 30  15 range 09 to 69 was similar to that of Group C 422  11 range 20 to 64 The mean B2M of both Groups A and C was significantly higher than that of Group B 238  102 range 04 to 54 P less than 0001 In Group A the mean B2M decreased significantly after a 12month period and reached the mean level of Group B but not that of normal controls When patients in Group B were analyzed by their stage of disease at diagnosis there was no significant difference between Stages I and II There was a significant difference in the mean B2M levels between Stages I and III In relapsing patients mean B2M levels increased These findings suggest that serum B2M levels may reflect tumor burden and even in patients at followup occult tumor cells may activate the immune system
R464	Captopril is commonly prescribed to patients with hypertension and congestive heart failure Adverse dermatological reactions have been reported in about ten percent of patients receiving captopril This case report describes a 77yearold white woman who developed bullous pemphigoid associated with the use of captopril The patient presented with bullous eruptions localized on the palms of both hands about 50 days after captopril 25 mg bid was started Biopsy report was consistent with bullous pemphigoid Captopril therapy was discontinued and the lesions healed after oral corticosteroid therapy was initiated
R465	Beta hemolytic streptococcus group G is increasingly being recognized as a cause of serious infections We describe a patient with group G streptococcus septic arthritis of the right knee and osteomyelitis of the proximal tibia Clinical details of 46 patients including 13 patients with infected prosthetic joints reported in the literature were reviewed 42 had multiple joint involvement Almost all patients had underlying conditions Almost onehalf were treated with antibiotics alone without therapeutic drainage procedures Patients with infected prosthetic joints did well without removal of infected prosthesis There have been 11 cases of group G streptococcus osteomyelitis reported including 3 cases with concomitant septic arthritis
R466	The performance of coagulometers in the National Quality Assessment Scheme NEQAS surveys of the prothrombin time conducted between 1986 and 1987 was reviewed There were sufficient data for analysis for eight types of coagulometer used with a single type of thromboplastin reagent and one instrument with an alternative reagent The overall reliability efficacy of each instrument was evaluated by determining the orthogonal regression slope parameters for prothrombin time PT and international normalised ratios INR using the manual technique as the reference method Seven of the eight types of coagulometer tended to overestimate the INR A pattern frequently observed with coagulometers and difficult to regulate was a trend to underestimate INR below 30 and overestimate higher INR Overestimation of INR values over 30 was particularly pronounced with three types of instrument Fibrintimer Lancer KC410 The KC410 was used by a sufficient number of participants to permit analysis of the performance of individual instruments Within instrument differences were similar to those produced by different types of coagulometers Thromboplastin reagents affected the INR values obtained with coagulometers The study indicates that each local reagentinstrument combination must be calibrated by the participant to obtain reliable INR values The use of a general correction factor for a local PT system seems to be invalid owing to the considerable variation in performance of individual coagulometers The two best guides to the choice of coagulometer may be the deviation from the manual result and precision estimated by the coefficient of variation of the INR
R467	To assess the role of intravenous isoproterenol for the facilitation of electrophysiologic induction of atrioventricular AV node reentrant tachycardia 20 patients with dual AV node pathways who lacked inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia at control study had a constant isoproterenol infusion administered and underwent repeat study Six 30 of 20 patients group I had inducible AV node reentrant tachycardia during isoproterenol infusion whereas the other 14 70 patients group II did not Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia was clinically documented in all 6 group I patients compared to 3 21 of 14 group II patients p  0002 The sensitivity and specificity of isoproterenolfacilitated induction of AV node reentrant tachycardia were 67 and 100 respectively The isoproterenolfacilitated induction of sustained AV node reentry was mediated by resolution of the weak link in anterograde slow pathway in 2 33 patients in retrograde fast pathway in 3 50 and in both anterograde slow and retrograde fast pathways in 1 17 patient Four group I patients were given intravenous propranolol 02 mgkg body weight and had complete suppression of isoproterenolfacilitated induction of AV node reentry Thus intravenous isoproterenol is a rather sensitive and highly specific adjunct to electrophysiologic induction of AV node reentrant tachycardia in patients with dual AV node pathways but without inducible sustained AV node reentry
R468	We report the effects of intravenous infusion of the atrial natriuretic peptide analogue metANP26 2 microgramsmin for 2 to 4 hours in four patients with cardiomyopathy and severe congestive cardiac failure who had not received any previous cardiac therapy The average cardiac index before infusion was 18 Lminm2 Severe sodium and water retention was confirmed by high levels of total body water and extracellular liquid whereas renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate were reduced Plasma concentration of ANP norepinephrine cortisol and growth hormone were significantly increased before infusion The infusion had no significant hemodynamic effect After 2 hours urine volume had increased significantly from 51 to 76 mlhr urinary concentration of sodium from 72 to 90 mmolL and sodium excretion from 45 to 82 mmolhr The infusion was accompanied by a significant increase in plasma irANP from 193 to 980 pgml There were no significant effects on the plasma concentrations of norepinephrine epinephrine aldosterone vasopressin cortisol growth hormone or prolactin and no significant change in plasma renin activity After 2 hours of infusion one patient had a severe sinus tachycardia and another had a sinus bradycardia Both arrhythmias disappeared without harmful effects soon after the infusion was stopped
R469	The aim of this study was to analyze the homing and progression patterns of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemias ALL in mice with severe combined immunodeficiency SCID Upon intraperitoneal IP transfer cells from relapse samples of three children with Tlineage ALL spread hematogenously and infiltrated the nonlymphoid andor lymphoid organs with a pattern reminiscent of the human clinical disease These mice either died or were killed in extremis at a mean of 9 weeks Moreover cell lines established in vitro from two of these samples manifested identical homing and progression in the SCID mouse as compared with the original patients cells Thus longterm culture of the primary leukemic T cells did not alter their invasive potential and migration pattern When engrafted IP three cell lines established from preBALL cases displayed primarily a lymphatic spread with induction of local tumor masses and kidneyliver nodules Mice were killed at 11 to 13 weeks but had not developed imminently fatal leukemia However when transferred intravenously one preB ALL cell line was able to spread hematogenously and to infiltrate both lymphoid and nonlymphoid tissues Overall these data demonstrate that the SCID mouse provides an efficient and reproducible model to study the pathogenesis of childhood ALL and may be a suitable system for evaluating therapy
R470	The anaesthetic management of a patient with EatonLambert myasthenic syndrome undergoing thoracotomy is described Epidural anaesthesia in combination with a light level of general anaesthesia provided good operating conditions and postoperative analgesia Pulmonary function and ventilatory responses to carbon dioxide and hypoxia were measured before operation These tests were repeated after the epidural administration of 8 ml 2 lignocaine before surgery and after 2 mg morphine sulphate in 10 ml saline postoperatively Minor reductions in some of the ventilatory parameters were observed The epidural technique appears to be a useful and safe method by which to manage patients with EatonLambert syndrome undergoing thoracotomy
R471	The production of antibody to a thymusdependent Ag requires cooperation between the B cell and an Agspecific Th cell MHC restriction of this interaction implies that the Th cell recognizes Ag on the B cell surface in the context of MHC molecules and that the Agspecific B cell gets help by acting as an APC for the Th cell However a number of studies have suggested that normal resting B cells are ineffective as APC implying that the B cell must leave the resting state before it can interact specifically with a Th cell Other studies including our own with rabbit globulinspecific mouse T cell lines and hybridomas show that certain T cell lines can be efficiently stimulated by normal resting B cells One possible explanation for the above contradiction is that our B cells have become activated before presentation Here we show that presentation by sizeselected small B cells is not the result of nonspecific activation signals generated by the T cells or components of the medium Also although LPS activation does increase the efficiency of presentation by small B cells use of large cells in place of small cells or preincubation of resting B cells with mitogenic doses of antiIg does not Another possibility that we considered was that small B cells are unable to process Ag and that we had selected T cell lines that were capable of recognizing native Ag on the B cell surface In the majority of cases experiments with B cell lines and macrophages have shown that Ag presentation requires Ag processing a sequence of events that includes internalization of Ag into an acid compartment denaturation or digestion of Ag into fragments and its return to the cell surface in the context of class II MHC molecules The experiments reported here show that our T cell lines require an Ag processing step and that small resting B cells like other APC process Ag before presenting it to T cells Specifically we show that an incubation of 2 to 4 h is required after the Ag pulse before Ag presentation becomes resistant to irradiation Shortly after the pulse the Ag enters a pronaseresistant compartment Although efficient Ag presentation requires initial binding to membrane Ig Ag is no longer associated with membrane Ig at the time of presentation and is not presented in its intact form because removal of membrane Ig by goat antiIg blocks presentation before but not after the Ag pulse
R472	A functioning rat thyroid cell line FRTL5 was used to study interactions of TSH with interferongamma IFN gamma and tumor necrosis factoralpha TNF alpha We examined effects on growth and differentiated function Growth was assessed by DNA incorporation of 3Hthymidine 3HTdr into DNA and cell number uptake of 125I I uptake and the concentration of cAMP were measured simultaneously with growth assessment IFN gamma stimulated the 30min I uptake and enhanced the effect of TSH TNF alpha had minimal effects on growth indices slight increase in 3HTdr incorporation and had no influence on I uptake it inhibited TSH stimulation of both growth and I uptake When combined IFN gamma and TNF alpha synergized in inhibiting TSHstimulated growth By itself TNF alpha inhibited stimulation of I uptake by TSH but augmented the enhancement seen with IFN gamma The influence of calf serum CS was to increase the rate of incorporation of 3HTdr but a similar qualitative pattern for the actions of the cytokines remained A reverse profile stimulation by IFN gamma inhibition by TNF alpha and stimulation by the combination was seen for I uptake with CS increasingly diminishing all values TSH stimulation of growth was progressively effective with increments of CS in the medium but consistently there was inhibition that was greater with IFN gamma than with TNF alpha and was almost total with the combined cytokines Stimulation of I uptake by TSH was enhanced by IFN gamma reduced by TNF alpha and when serum was present increased to a degree that was greater than additive by the combined cytokines Growth stimulation by insulin or insulinlike growth factorI was inhibited partially by the individual cytokines and completely by the combination Both insulin and insulinlike growth factorI inhibited TSH stimulation of I uptake but similar stimulation by the cytokines was not affected Simultaneous with inhibition of TSHstimulated growth both IFN gamma and TNF alpha enhanced cAMP accumulation The mechanism of these multiple effects of IFN gamma and TNF alpha especially on the actions of TSH may not currently be fully explained but they almost certainly reflect differing modes of action The relevance to thyroid function in man is conjectural Especially in Graves disease where thyroid infiltration with cells that secrete these cytokines is common it seems probable that both IFN gamma and TNF alpha will have significant influences on both growth and differentiated cell function
R473	Sixtytwo elderly apparently healthy volunteers inmates of a public nursing home were examined for evidence of primary Sjogrens syndrome pSS Evaluation included a specific questionnaire for subjective xerophthalmia and xerostomia slitlamp eye examination after rose Bengal staining Schirmers I test stimulated parotid flow measurement testing of sera for autoantibodies and labial minor salivary gland biopsy A greater than or equal to 2 lip biopsy score on Tarpleys scale was a sine qua non for the diagnosis of Sjogrens syndrome Labial salivary gland LSG biopsy revealed fibrosis andor fatty infiltration in the majority of the individuals related to ageing However four people had a lip biopsy score of greater than or equal to 2 which supplemented by other objective criteria classified three of them as having pSS Another four had an LSG biopsy score of 1 and although they fulfilled other objective criteria they could not be characterized as pSS All these individuals were completely asymptomatic and none of them had antiRoSSA or antiLaSSB autoantibodies The present study suggests that pSS in elderly people in elderly people is subclinical benign and relatively common
R474	Ornithine decarboxylase activity is known to be increased in certain premalignant conditions We determined the activity of this enzyme in mucosal biopsy specimens from 15 patients with Barretts esophagus Ornithine decarboxylase was greater in Barretts mucosa than in squamous esophageal or gastric mucosa In Barretts mucosa from 4 patients with dysplasia the enzyme activity was greater than in 11 patients without dysplasia 16  035 vs 019  008 Umg protein p less than 0005 Increased ornithine decarboxylase activity in biopsy specimens of Barretts mucosa may represent a marker for dysplasia
R475	Eightyeight patients with blunt renal trauma were examined sonographically Rupture of the kidney was diagnosed in 41 patients and contusion of the kidney in 45 The correlation between operative findings sonography and urography showed positive sonographic findings to be correct in all patients with rupture of the kidney In 4 patients with normal sonograms the diagnosis of a contusion was based on the urographic results Three patients underwent angiography An intimal lesion was seen in 2 and a tear of the renal artery in 1 The results of our investigation suggest that sonography should be applied in the first place in the evaluation of blunt renal trauma It is the investigation of choice during followup after surgical as well as conservative therapy
R476	A low field resistive nuclear magnetic resonance imaging system 008 Tesla was used to study the in vivo changes in the relaxation parameter T1 of the left ventricular myocardium from the first day to six months after acute myocardial infarction in 41 consecutive patients admitted to a coronary care unit T1 maps were constructed from transverse and coronal images at various times after infarction Thrombolytic treatment had been successful in 28 patients Thirty three of the 34 patients studied within two weeks of infarction had a significantly increased T1 value but this developed only after the third day in four At day 13 the mean 1 SD maximum T1 was 413 29 ms n  23 compared with 430 41 ms n  22 at day 47 433 35 ms n  24 at day 814 420 34 at one month n  22 388 39 n  20 at three months and 361 24 n  14 at six months The number of regions of interest with an increased T1 followed a similar time course Although the increase in T1 measured at three months correlated with the initial maximum creatine kinase and with the left ventricular ejection fraction measured at one month the number of regions with abnormal T1 from day 4 through to one month correlated best with left ventricular ejection fraction There was no significant difference in T1 between patients with or without reperfusion The rise in T1 over the first few days together with the prolonged time course of T1 increase suggests that the increase in T1 may reflect cellular infiltration as much or more than tissue oedema
R477	Hemodynamic tolerance to bicarbonate versus acetate hemodialysis was studied in seven ventilated critically ill patients suffering from acute renal failure Both kinds of hemodialysis were carried out with a recirculating dialysate delivery system and a relatively low blood flow 180 mlmin Each patient underwent two hemodialysis procedures one with bicarbonate and one with acetate lasting for four hours Ultrafiltration rates were kept below 250 mlh and only biocompatible membranes with a relatively small surface area Biospal 2400 Hospal France were used Despite the mild hemodialysis conditions hypotensive episodes with a mean blood pressure below 70 mmHg were observed in 3 out of 7 bicarbonate sessions and 4 out of 7 acetate sessions Thus we could not demonstrate a hemodynamic advantage of bicarbonate hemodialysis in this group of ventilated patients This contrasts with other studies conducted in nonventilated patients Prevention of hypoxemia by mechanical ventilation and control of vascular tone by the use of vasoactive drugs may be of more clinical relevance than the kind of hemodialysis procedure that is used
R478	Current concepts about the roles of human leukocyte antigen HLA and complement genes in predisposing to connective tissue diseases are reviewed Precise localization of disease conferring alleles and epitopes is confounded by two major phenomena 1 clinical and serologic heterogeneity of the diseases and associations of several different HLA alleles with different and often overlapping autoantibody responses and 2 linkage disequilibrium of many potentially relevant gene loci located on the diseaseassociated HLA haplotypes Using molecular genetic tools in serologically homogeneous patient populations and across racial lines the Ro SSA and la SSB autoantibody responses in systemic lupus erythematosus and Sjogrens syndrome appear to associate most strongly with HLADQ alleles whereas the antiJo1 autoantibody in myositis correlates best with HLADRw52 A gene deletion of C4A within HLA predisposes to systemic lupus erythematosus in both white and black patients
R479	We evaluated 104 patients with superficial bladder tumors for response to intravesical bacillus CalmettGuerin therapy Patients received 6 weekly intravesical bacillus CalmetteGuerin instillations and they were followed for response every 3 months with urinary cytology cystoscopy and bladder biopsy Patients were considered treatment failures if either the cytology studies or biopsies were positive for tumor Of 65 patients who failed the initial treatment course 57 were given an additional 6week course of therapy One 6week course of bacillus CalmetteGuerin was successful in 20 of 55 patients 36 per cent treated for prophylaxis 12 of 32 37 per cent treated for carcinoma in situ and 7 of 17 41 per cent treated for residual tumor The response rate for the total patient population treated with 1 6week course was 375 per cent 39 of 104 A second 6week course was successful in 19 of 29 patients 65 per cent treated for prophylaxis 11 of 18 71 per cent treated for carcinoma in situ and 4 of 10 40 per cent treated for residual tumor The response rate for all patients receiving a second course of bacillus CalmetteGuerin was 596 per cent 34 of 57 Of 6 patients who refused another 6week course of bacillus CalmetteGuerin 4 had additional recurrences and 3 of these 4 suffered invasive disease The overall therapeutic response rate for patients treated with either 6 or 12 weeks of therapy was 70 per cent These results suggest that 6 weeks of intravesical bacillus CalmetteGuerin do not provide optimal therapy for superficial bladder tumors The data further suggest that more intensive regimens may increase therapeutic efficacy

R481	Study Objective To determine the efficacy of intravenous aminophylline in the treatment of patients hospitalized for exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Design Randomized doubleblind placebocontrolled trial during the first 72 hours of hospitalization Patients Thirty patients admitted from the emergency room or walkin clinic with the primary diagnosis of an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Twentyeight patients completed the study 2 patients 1 receiving placebo and 1 receiving aminophylline were removed from the study because of respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation Interventions Patients received either intravenous aminophylline or placebo in addition to nebulized inhaled 03 mL of a 5 solution every 6 hours methylprednisolone 05 mgkg body weight every 6 hours intravenously ampicillin 500 mg orally every 6 hours tetracycline or trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole were substituted in penicillinallergic patients and supplemental oxygen as needed Aminophylline infusion rates were adjusted by an unblinded investigator to achieve theophylline levels of 72 to 83 mumolL Changes were also made in placebo infusion rates to maintain the doubleblind design Measurements and Main Results The forced expiratory volume in one second FEV1 and forced vital capacity FVC before and after metaproterenol inhalation were measured twice daily by a blinded investigator who also administered a verbal dyspnea index with a scale of 1 to 10 and questioned patients regarding possible side effects of treatment tremor palpitations nausea or vomiting Arterial blood gas measurements at 72 hours were compared with those obtained on admission Significant improvements in FEV1 and FVC measured before and after metaproterenol treatment and in dyspnea occurred over time in both treatment groups p less than 005 for all measurements However there were no significant differences between the placebo and aminophylline groups in any of the spirometric measurements or the dyspnea indices p greater than 05 in all five analyses The mean increases  SE in Po2 of 19  05 kPa with placebo and 17  07 kPa with aminophylline and the mean decreases in PCO2 of 05  04 kPa with placebo and 12  04 kPa with aminophylline were not significantly different p greater than 06 for PO2 p greater than 02 for PCO2ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS
R482	Soluble interleukin2 receptor SIL2R levels in sera were quantitated in asymptomatic intravenous drug abusers IVDA and in patients with lymphadenopathy or AIDS The mean SIL2R level in serum of normal controls was 158  19 compared to 368  35 Uml in serum of HIVseronegative asymptomatic IVDA The mean SIL2R in serum of HIVseropositive asymptomatic IVDA was 609  85 Uml and in patients with lymphadenopathy was 745  79 Uml In addition AIDS patients with Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia Kaposis sarcoma or both had elevated mean levels of SIL2R values with a broad range This elevated level of SIL2R may reflect excessive cell surface IL2R expansion by the infected cells
R483	We report three cases of spontaneous healing of aneurysmal bone cysts ABC In one case histological material was obtained after resection of the already ossified expansile mass discovered as a lytic lesion seven months previously In the two other patients spontaneous ossification of a radiologically presumed ABC in the lytic and expansile phase was observed after nine and seven months respectively The healed lesions have remained stable at 12 32 and 36 months respectively These findings suggest that when the diagnosis can be made with confidence and the lesion is in a location and at a stage that does not entail any risk of fracture or compression expectant management should be considered Our three patients were aged 22 19 and 18 years older than usual for developing ABC This is also true for many of the few other reported cases of spontaneous or almost spontaneous healing and suggests that ABC has a greater tendency to stabilise in older patients
R484	In most experiments when aminoglycoside antibiotic AG tissue levels are measured the AG is extracted into buffered media The data from this study reveal that buffer extraction results in only partial recovery of AG from tissues and that total recovery can be obtained after NaOH or trichloroacetic acid treatment Tissues studied here included the whole bullfrog and guinea pig kidney and cochlear tissues after in vivo drug treatment The AGs used were kanamycin tobramycin and gentamicin Drug concentrations were determined by enzymatic assay and in the case of tobramycin also 3Hlabeled radioactivity Only a fraction of total concentration of AG in tissue was released into the supernatants of tissue homogenates However the remainder was recovered after NaOH solubilization of the residual pellet Also it was found that the  G released from the pellet by NaOH was associated with protein By contrast trichloroacetic acid precipitation of tissue protein immediately released the drug into the supernatant
R485	We measured the intrinsic mechanical properties and protein content of single skinned muscle fibers obtained from patients who had Duchenne muscular dystrophy To check for possible nonspecific changes caused by muscle disease per se we also studied the properties of muscle fibers obtained from patients exhibiting severe muscle weakness due to polymyositis Relative to control fibers obtained from 4 patients with normal or nonmyopathic muscle we found no significant changes in the ability of muscle fibers from the patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy or polymyositis to generate active tension in response to calcium or resting tension in response to stretch In addition we found no significant changes in the concentrations of the major contractile proteins myosin and actin of the elastic protein titin or of the structural proteins nebulin and alphaactinin In contrast immunocytochemical studies showed that dystrophin was absent in the biopsy specimens from the patients with Duchenne muscular dystrophy but localized at the cell membrane in all of the other muscle biopsy specimens used in this study These results indicate that myofibrils assemble and function normally in Duchenne muscular dystrophy Therefore the absence of dystrophin which is the primary biochemical defect in this disease leads to clinical weakness by causing the breakdown of muscle fibers that were once capable of generating normal force while the surviving fibers exhibit normal contractility
R486	A total of 15 patients underwent ESWL using the Dornier HM3 lithotriptor with the patient in the prone position The stones were in the distal ureter over the sacroiliac joint in 10 patients 8 of whom had undergone unsuccessful ureteroscopic manipulation Two patients had horseshoe kidneys with stones that were too anterior to permit accurate targeting with the patient in the standard supine position One patient had a solitary stone in a pelvic kidney and 1 had an obstructing ureteropelvic junction stone in a crossed ectopic kidney The final patient had a reconstructed lower urinary tract with a stone at 1 of the ureterointestinal anastomoses Excellent pulverization was achieved in all patients after only 1 prone ESWL treatment One patient required temporary percutaneous nephrostomy after ESWL and 1 may require retrograde manipulation of fragments at the ureterovesical junction No patient had melena and other than temporary ileus in 1 patient who had concurrent supine ESWL of renal calculi no gastrointestinal complications were seen All but 1 patient were free of stones 1 month after prone ESWL Prone ESWL prevents blockage of shock wave energy by the bony pelvis because the shock waves enter anteriorly and exit posteriorly ESWL with the patient in the prone position is a safe and effective treatment of calculi in the distal ureter or anomalous kidney
R487	A case is presented of a pregnancy complicated by a suprasellar mass diagnosed at 27 weeks gestation This patient developed diabetes insipidus which was successfully treated with 1desamino8Darginine vasopressin Thyrotropinreleasing hormone and ACTH stimulation tests were also abnormal requiring the institution of thyroid and cortisol replacement therapy The patient was delivered at 34 weeks gestation secondary to worsening visual field testing A craniotomy was performed in the postpartum period with removal of a craniopharyngioma With successful medical treatment and careful observation surgical intervention may be postponed until postpartum or until a gestational age with lower neonatal morbidity and mortality is reached
R488	Oxidants from cigarette smoke or those produced by phagocytes are implicated in the pathogenesis of emphysema We reasoned that augmentation of antioxidant enzymes in cigarette smokers may be important in restricting direct and indirect oxidant damage to alveolar structures Accordingly we studied the activities of superoxide dismutase SOD catalase CAT and glutathione peroxidase GSHPx in alveolar macrophages AM from cigarette smokers and from smokeexposed hamsters The activities of these antioxidant enzymes were compared with the activities found in AM from nonsmoking control subjects The activities of SOD and CAT from AM of smokers and smokeexposed hamsters were twice that found in control subjects p less than 001 but there was no change in the activity of GSHPx Using the hamster model we found that filtration of smoke attenuated the increase in antioxidant activities and that after smoking cessation the increased activities had returned to those found with control subjects An adaptive response was further suggested by prolonged survival of smokeexposed hamsters in normobaric hyperoxia O2 greater than 95 Chronic smoke exposure in humans or hamsters causes increased SOD and CAT activities in AM This augmented activity may serve as a mechanism to limit oxidantmediated damage to alveolar structures
R489	The management of fluctuations in motor function complicating advanced Parkinsons disease with continuously administered dopaminomimetics was studied in 12 patients In response to 7 to 12 days of roundtheclock intravenous infusions of levodopa fluctuations in motor performance gradually diminished ultimately by more than 40 The beneficial effect persisted for about 6 days after withdrawal of continuous parenteral treatment and resumption of standard oral therapy Clinical improvement was associated with changes in several pharmacological indices Acute doseresponse studies of intravenous levodopa showed a shift of the curve to the right in the immediate postinfusion phase compared to preinfusion studies the therapeutic index improved significantly as patients demonstrated about 76 increased beneficial antiparkinsonian response with an equal degree of toxic dyskinetic effects and the duration of action of levodopa was prolonged by 30 These results suggest that changes in central dopaminergic mechanisms contributing to motor complications in advanced Parkinsons disease can be modified by procedures that provide continuous dopamine replacement Presumably these modifications underlie the gradual amelioration of motor fluctuations over several days of roundtheclock therapy Results of the present study also suggest potential deleterious effects of chronic intermittent oral treatment in the development of motor complications and thus support the role of longterm continuous administration of dopaminomimetics
R490	Thirtyfive patients with prostatic adenocarcinoma were treated by bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy and temporary implantation of iridium 192 strands with adjuvant external beam radiotherapy With the implant the prostate received between 3200 and 3500 gray Gy followed in two weeks by smallfield external beam irradiation for an additional dose of approximately 3400 Gy Morbidity included an ileofemoral thrombosis in one patient and transient radiation proctitis in four patients one patient required transurethral prostatic resection for obstruction at one year Local response of the primary tumor was dramatic in every case at threemonth followup In 11 of 15 patients 73 biopsy at one year showed no evidence of disease
R491	Rectal sensation is usually assessed using balloon distention The authors describe a more precise technique that avoids the variables of balloon dynamics and rectal diameter and compliance Using both methods rectal sensation was assessed in 13 healthy control women and 26 women with severe idiopathic constipation Balloon distention in the rectum revealed an elevated sensory threshold 169  44 vs 304  31 ml air controls vs patients P  0018 and volume required to elicit a call to stool 611  91 vs 975  64 P  0003 in subjects with severe constipation The maximum tolerated volume was similar in the two groups Rectal mucosal electrosensitivity was then tested using a bipolar ring electrode supplying a constant current This demonstrated an elevated sensory threshold in the constipated subjects 163  30 vs 274  21 mAmps P  0005 There was a significant correlation between the sensation thresholds for balloon distention and electrical stimulation for the entire subject group r  039 P  001 Two other patients with severe constipation after suspected extrinsic nerve damage were also studied and demonstrated a markedly abnormal electrical sensory threshold Electrical testing avoided the variables inherent in balloon distention and was well tolerated accurately quantifiable and reproducible The raised threshold to electrosensory mucosal testing suggests the presence of a rectal sensory neuropathy in patients with severe idiopathic constipation
R492	Hospital antineoplastic drug handling policies of 24 hospitals in eight Southwestern Ohio counties were compared with recommendations of the 1986 Occupational Safety and Health Administration OSHA guidelines Although most study facilities where antineoplastics are handled have policies content varies and is generally less complete than OSHA guidelines particularly regarding storing transporting and disposing of drugs managing equipment informing personnel of risk and surveillance Recommendations for personal protection concur more closely with OSHA guidelines than do other content areas
R493	The role of atrial natriuretic factor receptors in the colon is uncertain Accordingly the effects of atrial natriuretic factor in vivo and in vitro were studied In vivo perfusion of the colon in SpragueDawley rats was used to measure Na K Cl and water transport while atrial natriuretic factor was infused into the jugular vein at 05 or 10 microgramskg1min1 In vitro experiments in Ussing chambers measured shortcircuit current and ion fluxes before and after atrial natriuretic factor administration Because cyclic guanosine monophosphate is thought to be a second messenger for atrial natriuretic factor shortcircuit current was also determined before and after exposure to 8Brcyclic guanosine monophosphate Plasma atrial natriuretic factor atriopeptin III levels were determined by radioimmunoassay The in vivo transport of water sodium and chloride and the secretion of potassium were not altered by atrial natriuretic factor infusion In vitro studies showed no change in Na or Cl transport or change in shortcircuit current Plasma atrial natriuretic factor concentrations increased from 139  55 pgmL to 1385  396 pgmL during infusion and urine output increased from 126  05 microLmin to 374  29 microLmin P less than 005 In contrast 8Brcyclic guanosine monophosphate in vitro caused a significant P  00004 increase in shortcircuit current from 12  02 to 29  03 microEqcm2h1
R494	Two monoclonal antibodies MAbs IgG2a MAb ASHG4 and IgG2b MAb ASHE2 were produced in mice immunized with cultured human malignant glioma cells Both MAbs bound strongly to the surfaces of longterm cultured glioma cells and MAb ASHE2 also bound strongly to shortterm cultured glioma cells Sections of frozen glioma tissues bound both MAbs strongly whereas normal brain tissues showed weaker reactivities and tissues derived from carcinomas of various histological types were completely unreactive Furthermore the MAbs did not bind to peripheral blood cells or bone marrow cells Although both MAbs bound to the same Mr 2700029000 protein they may detect different or overlapping epitopes on this antigen Because MAbs ASHE2 and ASHG4 lysed cultured glioma cells with human peripheral blood lymphocytes as effector cells they are promising reagents for approaches to immunotherapy of human malignant gliomas
R495	Methylmalonic aciduria can be caused by mutations in the gene encoding the methylmalonyl coenzyme A mutase apoenzyme mut or genes required for the provision of cofactor B12 cbl The mut and cbl forms are classically differentiated by somatic cell complementation We describe a novel method for differential diagnosis of mut and cbl methylmalonic aciduria using DNAmediated gene transfer of a methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA clone Gene transfer of a functional methylmalonyl CoA mutase cDNA clone into mut fibroblasts reconstitutes holoenzyme activity measured by metabolism of 14Cpropionate in culture Identical gene transfers into cbl fibroblasts have no effect This method is used for the differential diagnosis of mut and cbl genotypes in cells from patients with a clinical diagnosis of methylmalonic aciduria and is shown to be a facile sensitive and specific method for genetic diagnosis This work establishes the principle of using DNAmediated gene transfer to identify the genotype of diseases which can result from mutations at several different genetic loci This type of differential genotypic diagnosis will be particularly important for establishing the applicability of somatic gene therapy in individual patients
R496	Shortterm and longterm cultures of mouse Thy1 epidermal cells EC were established in order to characterize their phenotypic and functional properties Concanavalin A Con A and Interleukin 2 IL2 stimulated Thy1 EC mediated nonMHC directed cytotoxicity preferentially against the NKsensitive target YAC1 vs the NKresistant target P815 these cells also mediated antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity ADCC indicating the presence of IgGFcR on at least some of them Freshly isolated Thy1 EC failed to lyse YAC1 targets however this activity was observed after 9 d of culture with Con A and IL2 While dendritic Thy1 EC in vivo do not express the Tcell markers L3T4 and Lyt2 shortterm cultured cells displayed phenotypic heterogeneity with small but significant percentages of Lyt2 and L3T4 cells appearing transiently The phenotype of the effector cells which mediates cytotoxic activity was determined by utilizing flow cytometry to sort shortterm cultured EC into positively and negatively stained populations Cells which express L3T4 or which lack asialo GM1 did not lyse YAC1 targets maximum cytotoxic activity was found within populations of cells which are asialo GM1 Lyt2 and asialo GM1 Lyt2 These studies indicate that Thy1 cells derived from mouse epidermis when cultured in the presence of Con A and IL2 have the capacity to generate a phenotypically heterogeneous population some cells of which are capable of mediating cytotoxic activities
R497	A group of 65 patients with superficial bladder carcinoma was followed for 2 years and tumour recurrence rate was correlated both with transferrin receptor status of the initial primary tumour and with the results of voided urine cytology Nine of 24 patients with transferrin receptor negative tumours had recurrences compared with 30 of 41 patients with transferrin receptor positive tumours This difference was highly significant Urine cytology at presentation was also predictive of further tumour formation of 30 patients who were transferrin receptor positive and had positive urine cytology 25 developed recurrences
R498	This article discusses some of the pitfalls and disadvantages of Mohs micrographic surgery for the excision of skin cancer These include 1 frozen section quality 2 interpretation of frozen sections 3 holes in fragmented tissue margins 4 tissue orientation problems 5 excessively narrow or wide margins 6 transection of the tumor itself 7 problems with multifocal tumor and 8 the tedious timeconsuming nature of the procedure Despite these problems the importance of the procedure in the treatment of cutaneous neoplasms should not be underestimated
R499	The purpose of this study was to determine if there is a relationship between improvement in exercise capacity with supplemental oxygen and the magnitude of hypoxic ventilatory drive in patients with CAO We hypothesized that those patients with the highest hypoxic drives would be the most likely to have increased exercise tolerance with supplemental oxygen Seventeen patients with CAO mean FEV1  099  045 L underwent identical maximal cycle ergometry exercise tests on two occasions 45 minutes apart while breathing either air or 30 percent oxygen in a randomized singleblind fashion With supplemental oxygen the ventilation decreased and the PaCO2 increased significantly at rest The patients had a significantly greater exercise tolerance on supplemental oxygen 767 vs 691 watts p less than 0005 but no increase in the maximal ventilation When the nine patients who improved were compared to the eight patients who did not improve the two groups were basically identical Specifically there were no significant differences in the mean ventilatory or mouth occlusion responses to hypoxia or in the blood gases The patients who did improve tended to have a greater reduction in their ventilatory response to exercise while exercising on oxygen as compared to when they were exercising on room air From this study it was concluded that measurements of hypoxic ventilatory drive are not helpful in predicting which patients with CAO are likely to have improved exercise capability while breathing supplemental oxygen
R500	A new technique is presented for examining patients suspected of having fractures in the nasoorbitoethmoidal region It consists of a bimanual examination with a Kelly clamp intranasally and the opposite index finger externally It has proven reliable in over 500 patient screenings to date This technique is recommended as an addition to and not a replacement for the standard physical examination and radiologic evaluation of the maxillofacial trauma patient
R501	Thirty adult surgical patients admitted to the recovery room with an oral temperature less than or equal to 350 degrees C were randomized into two groups Group 1 patients were covered with cotton blankets warmed to 370 degrees C and group 2 patients were treated with a forcedair warming system Mean oral temperature on admission to the recovery room was the same in both groups 343 degrees C Oral temperature and the presence or absence of shivering were recorded at 15min intervals After application of the selected warming method patients in group 2 were warmer at all time intervals Mean temperatures in the forcedair heating group and in group 1 were respectively 348 degrees C and 343 degrees C P less than 005 at 15 min 350 degrees C and 342 degrees C P less than 001 at 30 min 352 degrees C and 345 degrees C P less than 005 at 45 min 358 degrees C and 347 degrees C P less than 0001 at 60 min 360 degrees C and 350 degrees C P less than 001 at 75 min and 360 degrees C and 350 degrees C P less than 001 at 90 min The incidence of shivering was significantly greater in group 1 at 15 and 45 min In addition time spent in the recovery room was significantly greater in group 1 than in group 2 1560 min versus 997 min P less than 0003
R502	The concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide arginine vasopressin aldosterone and the plasma renin activity were studied in male rats with carbon tetrachlorideinduced compensated cirrhosis and the results were compared to those of normal control animals The rats with cirrhosis exhibited significantly higher plasma renin activity values when compared with the control group However plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic peptide and arginine vasopressin were not significantly different in the two groups Plasma aldosterone concentrations were significantly higher than those found in the normal control group in approximately 50 of the cirrhotic animals and were equal to or less than the control values in the rest This dissociation between plasma renin activity and aldosterone values in some of the cirrhotic animals is interesting and parallels observations made in humans with alcoholic cirrhosis The results suggest that experimentally induced apparently compensated cirrhosis may be associated with a perceived decrease in effective circulating volume and that there is no absolute deficiency of atrial natriuretic peptide in this model of cirrhosis
R503	Recent reports indicate that cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as aspirin may facilitate the release of interleukin2 from thymic T cells We have previously reported that aspirin has antihypertensive effects in the standard animal model of essential hypertension the spontaneously hypertensive rat SHR Because the SHR has been reported to be deficient in T cells it was of interest to determine whether the course of hypertension in this model could be altered by interleukin2 the T cell growth factor A single bolus of interleukin2 5000 unitskg sc prevented the increase of blood pressure in the young SHR and lowered pressure to normotensive levels in the wellestablished hypertensive adult SHR In the latter the effects of a single dose have been found to persist for at least 6 months with no toxic or untoward effects apparent Blood pressure in Goldblatt singlekidney wistarkyoto rats a model of renal hypertension was not affected by interleukin2
R504	Sexually transmitted diseases have an impact on childrens health at three times in their development during pregnancy or delivery through maternalneonatal transmission during prepubertal childhood through sexual transmission and during adolescence through sexual transmission These phases must be considered distinctly by the physician since not only the type of infection but also the management and longterm implications of the disease vary with the time period in which it was acquired
R505	To define a role for different oncogenes in bladder neoplastic progression we have introduced viral myc and src oncogenes singly or in combination into intact normal urothelium After incubation with virus infected mucosa was heterotransplanted under the renal capsule of syngeneic animals and monitored for progression toward malignancy by use of histologic and immunofluorescence techniques Although vmyc alone induced focal hyperplastic change more dysplastic lesions were observed after expression of the src oncogene product in urothelial implants In contrast lesions induced by myc and src acting cooperatively were highly proliferative displaying evidence of tumor formation within the 6week study period The presence and expression of myc and src oncogenic proteins associated with preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions was confirmed by use of Southern blot analysis and an immune complex kinase assay respectively These results indicate the formation of histologically distinct preneoplastic change elicited by the action of a single oncogene with induction of neoplastic changes when such oncogenic elements act cooperatively This model provides an opportunity to study the action of different oncogenes throughout bladder neoplastic progression in vivo
R506	Indium111labeled antimyosin has been utilized in the diagnosis and localization of acute transmural myocardial infarction The present report describes a patient who presented with a massive subendocardial infarction Two days after the injection of antimyosin the patients clinical status markedly deteriorated and he expired Postmortem examination demonstrated severe threevessel coronary artery disease with extensive myocyte death in the endocardium Autoradiography and histochemical staining of the prosected heart demonstrated high correlation for myocardial necrosis and corresponded to clinical evidence for diffuse subendocardial infarction
R507	Thrombosis is the end result of two closely interrelated processes the coagulation cascade and the platelet aggregation process To determine their relative contribution we used pharmacologic agents that selectively block each process The specific effect of each pharmacologic agent on either fibrin deposition or platelet activity was confirmed morphologically by scanning electron microscopy and was substantiated with ADPinduced platelet aggregation and blood clotting time determinations Fortytwo rats had both femoral arteries subjected to a standardized crushavulsion injury A total of 84 femoral microvascular anastomoses were subsequently performed None of the 24 control anastomoses treated with saline remained patent whereas 6 of 24 of the anastomoses treated with dazmagrel a selective thromboxane synthetase and platelet aggregation inhibitor 25 mgkg IV remained patent and 18 of 24 of those treated with a single dose of heparin 200 Ukg IV remained patent All 12 anastomoses treated with both drugs remained patent but developed a 33 percent hematoma rate We conclude that in this microvascular model fibrin mesh deposition is a more significant factor than platelet aggregation in the pathogenesis of occlusional thrombosis within traumatized arteries Its temporary inhibition with a single dose of heparin yielded a 75 percent improvement in patency rate
R508	In 18 patients with upper airway obstruction we measured dynamic lung volumes maximal flows airway resistance Raw and total respiratory resistance Rrs and reactance Xrs at various frequencies by means of a forced oscillation method Patients were classified according to the site and the type of the obstruction The values of Raw Rrs and Xrs were tightly correlated and reflected the overall importance of the obstruction In comparison with patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the values of Rrs tend to be higher and to be influenced more by support of the cheeks during the measurement These differences are not diagnostic however
R509	Lipid peroxidation reactions during reperfusion after cardiac arrest may contribute to postischemic cerebral hypoperfusion which in turn can contribute to permanent neurological dysfunction We designed this study to determine whether the aminosteroid U74006F a putative inhibitor of lipid peroxidation mitigates cerebral multifocal hypoperfusion after cardiac arrest We used our established dog model of ventricular fibrillation cardiac arrest no blood flow of 125 minutes reperfusion by cardiopulmonary bypass of less than or equal to 5 minutes and control of extracerebral variables during 4 hours postarrest Cerebral blood flow was monitored by the stable xenon computed tomography method Changes in cerebral oxygen consumption were obtained from mean blood flow values of coronal slices and the cerebral arteriovenous sagittal sinus oxygen content difference A treatment group n  5 received U74006F starting with reperfusion 15 mgkg ia plus 15 mgkg iv and three additional graded doses over 4 hours total dose 45 75 or 145 mgkg The U74006Ftreated group showed the same postarrest transient hyperemia and protracted hypoperfusion in terms of global computed tomography slice regional and local multifocal cerebral blood flow values and the same global cerebral oxygen consumption pattern as a concurrent control group n  5 At 14 hours postarrest in both groups there was mismatching of global cerebral oxygen consumption which reached baseline values in relation to global cerebral blood flow and oxygen delivery which remained at 50 of baseline We conclude that treatment with U74006F after prolonged cardiac arrest causes no deleterious side effects and does not seem to alter multifocal postarrest cerebral blood flow and oxygen consumption
R510	Umbilical artery Doppler studies were performed on the day of delivery in 15 singleton preterm pregnancies In each case the fetus was significantly growth retarded on ultrasound examination and the attending obstetrician had made a decision to deliver the patient of the infant Eight women had severe preeclampsia three had mild chronic hypertension and in four there was no recognized maternal disorder Doppler studies were analyzed by use of the pulsatility index and the AB ratio In 14 of the 15 cases both were markedly abnormal Three early neonatal deaths occurred A positive correlation was found between the degree of abnormality of the pulsatility index and AB ratio and a poor neonatal outcome p less than 0001 and p less than 002 Umbilical artery Doppler studies were not helpful in differentiating between intrinsic and extrinsic causes of growth retardation but seemed to identify the pregnancy at increased risk of a poor neonatal outcome
R511	Twenty patients with osteosarcoma and pathologic fractures were treated with a chemotherapeutic regimen consisting of cisdiamminedichloroplatinumII CDP Adriamycin ADR doxorubicin and highdose methotrexate with citrovorum factor rescue MTXCF Before the introduction of the regimen the primary tumor in two patients was treated by immediate amputation and in 13 with preoperative intraarterial CDP Among these 13 patients responses healing were observed in 11 one required the addition of radiation therapy In three patients the responses were so dramatic that at their request surgery was deferred and treatment exclusively with chemotherapy was instituted Based on this experience treatment exclusively with chemotherapy was also administered to an additional five patients who were admitted without pathologic fractures In the course of such treatment pathologic fractures also developed notwithstanding chemotherapy was maintained and healing also occurred One of the 20 patients had pulmonary metastases at diagnosis these were resected after treatment and pathologic examination revealed no evidence of viable tumor The remaining 19 patients were free of pulmonary metastases but these later developed in seven patients These data were compared to a historical control series in which 16 of 21 patients with pathologic fractures developed pulmonary metastases Three of the chemotherapy treated patients died of nonosteosarcoma related causes leukemia generalized varicella and a metabolic complication Overall survival was improved in the chemotherapy treated patients as compared to the historical control series 10 of 20 versus 6 of 21 respectively Pathologic fractures in osteosarcoma may heal under treatment with chemotherapy which also has a favorable impact on the eradication of pulmonary metastases and survival
R512	A 16kilodalton protein expressed in cells producing the human immunodeficiency virus HIV1 was identified as the gene product of the vpu open reading frame When expressed in vitro the 81amino acid vpu protein reacted with about onethird of the serum samples from AIDS patients that were tested indicating that the vpu open reading frame is expressed in vivo as well Introduction of a frameshift mutation into the vpu open reading frame did not significantly interfere with expression of the major viral proteins in a transient expression system However a five to tenfold reduction in progeny virions was observed after the infection of T lymphocytes with the mutant virus These data suggest that the vpu gene product is required for efficient virus replication and may have a role in assembly or maturation of progeny virions
R513	Thirtytwo patients presenting with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were entered into the following doubleblind crossover study First time 0 patients inhaled either ipratropium bromide 54 micrograms or metaproterenol sulfate 195 mg via a metered dose inhaler MDI attached to a device Inspirease phase 1 After 90 minutes they inhaled whichever of the two medications they had not received in phase 1 This is referred to as phase 2 Pulmonary function FEV1 and FVC was measured at time 0 and at 30 60 and 90 minutes following phase 1 treatment and at 30 60 and 90 minutes following phase 2 treatment 120 150 and 180 minutes from the start of the study Arterial blood gas samples n  20 were obtained at entry into the study and 30 and 90 minutes after phase 1 medication The groups did not differ in age degree of airway obstruction hypoxemia or theophylline usage at the start of the study In phase 1 at 90 minutes pulmonary function in both groups significantly and similarly improved For ipratropium FEV1 improved from 062  008 L to 088  011 L p less than 001 and for metaproterenol FEV1 improved from 069  006 to 092  009 L p less than 001 There was no further improvement with phase 2 treatment for either group Thirty minutes after inhaling ipratropium there was a small but significant rise in PO2 58  30 mm Hg p less than 005 while metaproterenol inhalation resulted in a 62  12 mm Hg decline in PO2 p less than 005 These changes were not sustained at 90 minutes We concluded that for acute exacerbations of COPD both ipratropium and metaproterenol are effective medications when administered via an MDI attached to a device Inspirease However ipratropium may be a safer choice as it initially did not cause a decline in blood oxygenation
R514	Cranial settling and basilar invagination with medullospinal compression is believed to have resulted in the production of a syrinx in a case of Pagets disease of the cranium This mechanism of compression at the craniovertebral junction resembles the development of syringomyelia in Chiari malformations presenting in adult life
R515	We investigated the effect of mild wholebody hyperthermia before and after 16 minutes of global cerebral ischemia on metabolic recovery during recirculation in cats using in vivo phosphorus31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy Hyperthermia temperature 406  02 degrees C was induced greater than or equal to 1 hour before ischemia and was maintained during 152 hours of recirculation in nine cats four cats were subjected to hyperthermia without cerebral ischemia six to hyperthermia during recirculation after return of intracellular pH to preischemic values and 14 to normothermic ischemia and recirculation Our data indicate that preischemic hyperthermia results in an intracellular cerebral pH during recirculation significantly lower than that in normothermic cats In hyperthermic cats betaATP and phosphocreatine PCr concentrations and the ratio of PCr to inorganic phosphate failed to return to preischemic levels during recirculation in contrast to normothermic cats Hyperthermia without ischemia and hyperthermia during recirculation had no significant effect on intracellular pH Thus preischemic hyperthermia has a detrimental effect on metabolic recovery after transient global cerebral ischemia
R516	Complications observed in 51 patients receiving corticosteroids for greater than 1 year for asthma and other chronic pulmonary diseases were compared retrospectively with 31 control patients who had never been on corticosteroids The prevalence of Cushingoid features P less than 005 ocular complications cataracts and glaucoma P less than 025 and skeletal complications compression fractures of vertebrae aseptic necrosis of the femoral head and osteopenia P less than 005 in the study group was significantly higher than in the control group as was the prevalence of total complications P less than 005 Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that serious ocular and skeletal complications were directly proportional to the total lifetime dosage of corticosteroids The high toxicity of steroid therapy should give further impetus to the formulation of ways to reduce or avoid steroid complications
R517	This case report describes a falsepositive hepatobiliary scan in a young woman suspected to have acute cholecystitis who apparently had none of the reasons stated in the literature for a falsepositive scan The literature review shows that the negative predictive value of hepatobiliary scanning for acute cholecystitis is nearly 100 percent while the positive predictive value is also quite good if conditions known to cause falsepositive scans are ruled out Common causes of positive hepatobiliary scanning other than acalculus cholecystitis include chronic cholecystitis cholecystitis hepatitis alcoholism total parenteral nutrition pancreatitis prolonged fasting and ingestion of food less than one hour prior to scanning Whether the postpartum state affects the accuracy of hepatobiliary scanning is speculative
R518	This prospective multicenter randomized unblinded controlled clinical trial was designed to determine if the intrapleural instillation of 1500 mg of tetracycline hydrochloride would be effective in diminishing the ipsilateral rate of recurrence for spontaneous pneumothorax During the 4year enrollment period 113 patients were assigned to the tetracycline group 116 patients were assigned to the control group During the 5year study period the recurrence rate in the tetracycline group 25 was significantly less than that in the control group 41 Use of tetracycline seemed to reduce the recurrence rates for patients with either primary or secondary spontaneous pneumothorax and for patients with either an initial or a recurrent pneumothorax We conclude that the intrapleural administration of tetracycline in patients with spontaneous pneumothorax significantly reduces the rate of ipsilateral recurrence but is associated with intense chest pain Intrapleural tetracycline therapy is indicated for patients with a spontaneous pneumothorax who are hospitalized and are treated with tube thoracostomy
R519	In this article methods for measuring brain morphologic features on magnetic resonance images are described and normative data are provided for six morphologic variables An estimated function relating age ranging from 8 to 79 years to average values is given for each measure A linear decrease over the age range is observed in the volume of the cerebrum Linear increases are observed in measures of ventricular and sulcal fluid A curvilinear decrease in cortical volume is found and is demonstrable even in young adults Highly nonlinear increases in the volume of signal hyperintensities are observed in cortical and subcortical regions The methods described may be used to provide an ageadjusted index of morphologic abnormality for each subject on any of the measures They are currently in use in ongoing neurobehavioral studies of patients with nonfocal brain abnormalities and primary disorders of affect and cognition
R520	The use of epidural morphine for postoperative analgesia outside of intensive care units remains controversial In this report our anesthesiologybased acute pain service documents experience with 1106 consecutive postoperative patients treated with epidural morphine on regular surgical wards This experience involved 4343 total patient days of care and 11089 individual epidural morphine injections On a 010 verbal analog scale patientreported median pain scores at rest and with coughing or ambulation were 1 interquartile range 3 and 4 interquartile range 4 respectively The incidence of side effects requiring medication were as follows pruritus 24 nausea 29 and respiratory depression 02 There were no deaths neurologic injuries or infections associated with the technique Migration of epidural catheters into the subarachnoid space and into epidural veins each occurred twice Overall 1051 of the 1106 patients 95 experienced none of the following problems catheter obstruction premature dislodgement painful injections catheter migration infection or respiratory depression We conclude that postoperative pain can be safely and effectively treated with epidural morphine on surgical wards
R521	Although spontaneous regression of cardiac rhabdomyoma has been reported prognosis is still considered to be poor and surgery continues to be indicated The experience with rhabdomyoma diagnosed in live infants over a 20year period was reviewed Diagnosis by angiography or echocardiography was accepted only if multiple tumors were present or if tuberous sclerosis was also diagnosed Nine patients 3 diagnosed prenatally and the remaining 6 at age less than 8 months were identified as having a total of 24 tumors Measurements in 2 planes demonstrated at least some evidence of regression in 24 patients 100 with 20 of 24 having complete resolution One patient required delayed surgery for excision of a subaortic ridge that appeared at the site of a resolved tumor Our findings suggest that pediatric cardiac rhabdomyoma is most often a benign condition in which spontaneous regression is the rule Surgery is recommended only for patients with refractory dysrhythmias or severe hemodynamic compromise
R522	Transesophageal echocardiography with a single plane transverse axis dedicated pediatric probe was performed prospectively in 25 anesthetized children undergoing routine cardiac catheterization or intracardiac surgery to assess the potential role of this technique in the initial diagnosis perioperative management and postoperative followup of children with congenital heart disease The group ranged in age from 1 year to 148 years mean 61 and weight from 65 to 52 kg mean 224 Studies were successful in all patients and no complications were encountered The results of the transesophageal studies combined imaging color flow mapping and pulsed wave Doppler sampling were correlated both with the results of prior precordial studies and the information obtained at cardiac catheterization Transesophageal echocardiography provided a more detailed evaluation of the morphology and function of systemic and pulmonary venous return the atria interatrial baffles atrioventricular valves and the left ventricular outflow tract Additional information was obtained in 15 patients 60 Problem areas for single plane transesophageal imaging were the apical interventricular septum the right ventricular outflow tract and the left pulmonary artery The intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography allowed assessment of the surgical repair and monitoring of ventricular function and volume status while the patient was weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass Transesophageal echocardiography in pediatric patients is of additional value in three main areas 1 the precise morphologic diagnosis of congenital heart disease 2 perioperative monitoring and 3 postsurgical followup
R523	Human immunodeficiency virus HIV RNA and proteins were detected in the brains of several AIDS patients with subacute encephalitis by in situ hybridization and immunohistology The majority of infected cells were mononucleated and bore processes Using single and double immunohistologic procedures the authors identified these cells as macrophages The majority of them had the phenotype of microglial cells LeuM3 CD4 others were labeled with markers of circulating macrophages LeuM3 CD4 The presence of HIV RNA and proteins in CD4 cells could be explained by depressed CD4 antigen expression as a result of infection or macrophage tissue differentiation
R524	Congenital pseudarthrosis of the tibia was perhaps described almost 300 years ago yet it remains one of the most difficult conditions to treat in orthopedic surgery Recent advances in surgical techniques have given much more encouraging results Coleman has played a significant role in this progress with his concept of complete correction of the tibial and fibular deformities and fixation with strong and long intramedullary rods To this technique have been added autologous cancellous bone grafting and electrical stimulation These advances have increased the rate of successful union of the pseudarthrosis of the tibia More recently transfer of a vascularized fibular graft with correction at the same time of the leglength discrepancy has offered even greater hope for achieving successful bony union of the tibia This treatment involves surgery on the normal leg Longterm results of this method of management are eagerly awaited
R525	Serologic testing for antibodies is at present the only practical means of diagnosing Borrelia burgdorferi infection However specific IgM spirochetal antibodies may not be at detectable concentrations in the early stage of Lyme disease within 6 weeks of onset Western blot analysis may be used to confirm indirect fluorescent antibody staining or enzymelinked immunosorbent assay results but it is laborious and expensive Falsepositive reactions caused by crossreactivity do occur In patients who have had subclinical Lyme disease and contract another illness that causes similar symptoms interpretation of serologic test results may be confused by residual antibodies Therefore assay results should always be interpreted in conjunction with clinical and epidemiologic findings
R526	The authors discuss the indications for hydroxypolyethoxydodecan in the sclerosing treatment of angiomas with particular reference to cavernous venous and evolutive angiomas ie immature angiomas that fail to involute by eight to ten months Moreover the sclerosing agent may be employed in connection with embolization and subsequent surgery in arteriovenous angiomas with a relevant cutaneoussubcutaneous development The authors have successfully used the interstitial sclerosing technique according to Andrews method This technique involves interstitial injections to obtain the sclerosis of the thin threads of fibrous tissue stroma between the blood vessels The sclerosing therapy may cause the complete regression of low flow angiomas or at least a partial reduction that simplifies the ensuing surgical excision In the case of partial regression of the angioma obtained with the sclerosing therapy the surgery of the remaining angioma causes a lesser degree of bleeding especially in areas that do not particularly lend themselves to surgical exploration ie the oral cavity an increased reliability in the radicality of the intervention due also to the reduced size of the lesion and better results from an aestheticfunctional point of view
R527	A doubleblind doubledummy crossover study compared oral controlledrelease morphine sulfate MS Contin tablets MSC Purdue Frederick Norwalk CT every 12 hours and immediaterelease morphine sulfate IRMS tablets every 4 hours in 14 evaluable patients with chronic cancer pain The test model described showed assay sensitivity for steadystate analgesia requiring relatively few subjects to yield statistical significance in pharmacologic potency estimates Initial doses were the calculated equivalents of about one third the previous opioid requirements or at least 30 mg MSC every 12 hours or 15 mg IRMS every 4 hours This was generally subtherapeutic hence additional IRMS was available for breakthrough pain Doses of MSC and IRMS were titrated upwards until the requirement for rescue IRMS was less than 20 of the total daily amount of morphine In both study phases the total dose of morphine increased significantly from the first day to the last on which it was significantly 34 higher for IRMS than MSC Pain was significantly less intense and frequent in the last 24 hours of each treatment arm than in the first and equally well controlled by both regimens The two treatments were equipotent in a pharmacologic assay using dosages and pain scores The requirement for rescue analgesia was similarly comparable for both treatments decreasing significantly with upward dose titration The few side effects experienced one with MSC and three with IRMS did not include serious reactions such as respiratory depression It is concluded that MSC 12hourly controls cancer pain as effectively and safely as IRMS on a 4hour schedule MS Contin exhibits a 12hour duration of action as previously shown in other wellcontrolled trials A problem of pain exacerbation at the start of each study phase was found to be associated with the design of this study It may be resolved with a higher initial study dose andor use of a patientcontrolled analgesia device for parenteral rescue doses
R528	The objective of this doubleblind study which is part of a multicenter study was to determine whether terfenadine 120 mg once daily has similar efficacy and tolerability to the standard dosage of 60 mg twice daily in the treatment of chronic urticaria Fortyone patients were randomly allocated to two parallel groups and treated for 2 weeks with either regimen Evaluation of efficacy was based on rating scales for investigator and patient Primary endpoints were itch number of wheals wheal size and the overall rating of efficacy A similar improvement was seen in all variables There were no statistically significant differences between groups Both treatments were well tolerated
R529	Idiopathic hypercalciuria defined as the urinary excretion of more than 300 mg calcium per day in men or more than 250 mg calcium per day in women or more than 4 mg calcium per kg per day is observed in about 50 per cent of the patients with calcium oxalateapatite nephrolithiasis and is one of the risk factors for stone formation These patients do not exhibit hypercalcemia elevated serum parathyroid hormone concentrations or urinary cyclic adenosine monophosphate excretion nor clinical evidence of sarcoidosis other granulomas or a malignancy Hypophosphatemia may be present Augmented rates of intestinal absorption of dietary calcium account for most of the increments in urinary calcium Serum 125dihydroxyvitamin D concentrations are in the upper normal range or elevated among many patients and are normal but not suppressed in the others Activation of 125dihydroxyvitamin D formation may be secondary to hypophosphatemia or other as yet undefined factors Since 125dihydroxyvitamin D apparently can upregulate its own receptor small increments in its synthesis and blood levels could amplify the effect of the hormone to stimulate intestinal calcium absorption Calcium balances are slightly but significantly negative and urinary hydroxyproline excretion may be increased so that a generalized disorder of calcium homeostasis also involving bone may be present Additional studies are required to determine the genetic basis for the occurrence of idiopathic hypercalciuria in families the cause of greater expression of idiopathic hypercalciuria in men and whether environmental factors high dietary sodium chloride protein and purified carbohydrate intakes contribute to the expression of idiopathic hypercalciuria Although thiazide diuretics inorganic phosphate magnesium hydroxide and potassium citrate have provided effective therapy prospective studies are needed to determine optimum therapy and the optimum duration of treatment
R530	This case study reports on a suicide made to look like murder The case highlights the issue of false claims of criminal victimization and suggests the need for a reexamination of the dynamics of factitious allegations of criminal victimization Factitious complaints of mental or physical illness are typically selfreported to psychiatric or medical authorities This paper illustrates a different kind of phenomenon one in which an injury or disorder is brought to medical attention by way of the police who report the death or injury as arising from criminal victimization
R531	In situ hybridization histochemistry and immunocytochemistry were used to study the prenatal expression of luteinizing hormonereleasing hormone LHRH cells in the mouse Cells expressing LHRH mRNA and peptide product were first detected on embryonic day 115 E115 in the olfactory pit On E125 the majority of LHRH cells were located on tracks extending from the olfactory pit to the base of the telencephalon From E125 to E155 LHRH cells were detected in a rostraltocaudal gradient in forebrain areas Prior to E125 cells expressing LHRH mRNA were not detected in forebrain areas known to contain LHRH cells in postnatal animals Quantitation of cells expressing LHRH mRNA showed that the number of labeled cells on E125 approximately 800 equaled the number of LHRH cells in postnatal animals but more than 90 of these cells were located in nasal regions Between E125 and E155 the location of LHRH cells shifted The number of LHRH cells in the forebrain increased while the number of LHRH cells in nasal regions decreased over this same period These findings establish that cells first found in the olfactory pit and thereafter in forebrain areas express the LHRH gene and correspond to the position of LHRH immunopositive cells found at these developmental times To further examine the ontogeny of the LHRH system immunocytochemistry in combination with 3Hthymidine autoradiography was used to determine when LHRH cells left the mitotic cycle We show that LHRH neurons exhibit a discrete time of birth suggesting that they arise as a single neuronal population between E100 and E110 Postnatal LHRH neurons were birthdated shortly after differentiation of the olfactory placode and before LHRH mRNA was expressed in cells in the olfactory pit Taken together these studies support the hypothesis that all LHRH cells in the central nervous system arise from a discrete group of progenitor cells in the olfactory placode and that a subpopulation of these cells migrate into forebrain areas where they subsequently establish an adultlike distribution
R532	This study evaluates the use of the nonporous hydroxylapatite HA granules and blocks as an extracranial augmentation material in monkeys Augmentation was performed in 12 Rhesus monkeys killed at three six and 12 months postoperatively Clinical evaluation revealed that the HA granules become stable within three to four weeks but there is loss of some augmented height due to settling of the material within the subpericranial pocket The HA blocks maintained the augmented cranial contours but 25 of them exhibited mobility Histologic evaluation revealed no evidence of inflammation or bone resorption with either the HA granular or block form The HA granules were separated from each other and from the bone interface by a layer of collagen fibers and the blocks were also surrounded by a fibrous capsule There was no evidence of bonding between the HA granules and the boneHA interface was separated by an intervening fibrous layer in all the HA granular specimens except for one in the one year group which showed evidence of bone formation in part of the HA bone interface It was concluded that when used as an extracranial augmentation material the nonporous HA granules were more stable than blocks however the blocks maintain a better contour
R533	Previous studies have reported that exercise tolerance improves with transtracheal oxygen delivery However patients were not blinded to the delivery technique used introducing a potential source of bias The purpose of this study was to compare exercise tolerance during nasal cannula and transtracheal delivery using a randomized doubleblinded technique Subjects n  11 performed 12min walks on the same day while receiving nasal cannula and transtracheal delivery Nine of 11 subjects walked farther with transtracheal delivery a significant increase p less than 001 Mean increase in walk distance was 95  86 feet In addition a trend was seen toward greater improvement in walk distance with greater flows through the catheter r  058 p less than 006 Time into the walk when desaturation SaO2 less than 90 first occurred was not significantly different We conclude that exercise tolerance improves when oxygen is delivered by transtracheal catheter This improvement is unrelated to an increase in SaO2 We speculate that the increase in exercise tolerance may be related to other physiologic effects of flow through the catheter
R534	We have previously reported that there is a global reduction in adenylyl cyclase associated with a decrement in Gs functional activity in cardiac sarcolemma from animals with pressure overloadinduced hypertrophy and heart failure This study was performed to determine whether hypertrophy alone in the absence of heart failure is sufficient to promote these changes and whether the superimposition of heart failure intensified these changes Basal and stimulated adenylyl cyclase and Gs activity as determined in the S49 cyc reconstitution assay were measured in sarcolemma from normal NL left ventricular hypertrophy LVH and heart failure HF animals Simultaneously we measured the mRNA level encoding for the Gs alpha subunit These studies indicate that Gs activity and Gs alpha mRNA are decreased by approximately 30 both in the failing heart and even in the heart with compensated hypertrophy before heart failure develops Gs activity pmol cyclic AMP10 min per microgram NL 42  04 LVH 30  02 HF 32  03 Gs alpha mRNA pg10 micrograms RNA NL 131  90 LVH 104  74 HF 974  91 P less than 005 as compared with NL for LVH and HF Accompanying this decrement in Gs activity is a fall in adenylyl cyclase both basal and stimulated However we also identified a further decrease in adenylyl cyclase without any additional change in Gs or in its alpha subunit mRNA level This is seen only in the sarcolemma from animals with heart failure as compared with those with compensated LV hypertrophy eg NaFstimulated activity pmol cyclic AMPmin per mg NL 4202  175 LVH 3471  296 HF 2442  273 P less than 005 compared with NL for LVH and HF P less than 005 compared with LVH for HF In summary these studies indicate that both Gs and adenylyl cyclase activities fall in parallel with the development of LV hypertrophy followed by a further decrement in adenylyl cyclase independent of Gs in the setting of heart failure
R535	The purpose of this investigation was to develop a simple model to assess superoxide production from isolated vessels and to use this model to study the effects of various compounds on superoxide generation The established method of cytochrome C reduction by superoxide was modified to measure superoxide production in vascular rings from rabbit aortae The diabetogenic compound alloxan significantly increased superoxide production in a concentrationdependent manner The nitrovasodilators nitroprusside and minoxidil exhibited contrasting effects Nitroprusside inhibited alloxanstimulated production of superoxide but minoxidil had no effect suggesting different mechanisms of action for these drugs The cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin had no effect on the production of superoxide stimulated by alloxan demonstrating that superoxide production induced by this compound is not affected by mechanisms involving cyclooxygenase These data demonstrate the use of a simple rapid and inexpensive method for measuring superoxide produced by intact vessels This may be useful in testing drugs exhibiting antioxidant and vasoactive properties Finally because superoxide is implicated in the destruction of endotheliumderived relaxing factor and the presence of the vasodilator nitroprusside reduces superoxide production it is concluded that some nitrovasodilators may have additional vascular effects through the suppression of superoxide formation
R536	A retrospective study of 88 cases of extraskeletal osteosarcoma revealed that this tumor affects adults almost exclusively with a high incidence in patients older than 50 years and is slightly more common in males 58 than in female patients The tumor occurred principally as a soft tissue mass in an extremity with a predilection for the thighs lower extremity 466 upper extremity 205 and the retroperitoneum 17 Most were deepseated and were firmly attached to the fascia but occasionally they were freely movable and confined to the subcutis or dermis Nearly all presented as an insidiously growing mass rarely causing pain or tenderness The preoperative duration of symptoms ranged from 2 weeks to 25 years median 6 months In 17 cases it exceeded 2 years A history of prior trauma to the site of the tumor was stated in 11 of the 88 cases 125 and of radiation in five cases 57 Microscopically the tumors contained varying amounts of neoplastic osteoid and bone sometimes together with islands of malignantappearing cartilage Like osteosarcoma of bone extraskeletal osteosarcoma showed a striking variation in histologic appearance and focally resembled malignant fibrous histiocytoma fibrosarcoma and malignant schwannoma Followup information was available for 65 patients Eight 123 patients were alive with no evidence of recurrence 12 185 patients were alive with one or more recurrences and five 76 were alive with metastases Twentyeight of the tumors 43 recurred and 39 63 metastasized Forty 615 of the patients with followup information had died 36 from the tumor and four from miscellaneous causes The prevailing sites of metastases were the lung the regional lymph nodes and bone
R537	Therapy of neurocysticercosis with cysticidal drugs is frequently complicated by the exacerbation of symptoms that follows the inflammation triggered by the acute destruction of cysticerci Treatment of such adverse reactions with dexamethasone is highly effective However it has been shown that dexamethasone lowers the plasma levels of praziquantel thus reducing its cysticidal efficacy We measured plasma levels of albendazole another strong cysticidal drug when dexamethasone was given simultaneously We found that dexamethasone increased the plasma levels of albendazole by about 50 P less than 0002 hence it seems that cysticercosis and the ensuing inflammation can be treated simultaneously with albendazole and dexamethasone without diminishing the efficacy of the cysticidal drug
R538	This has been an analysis of a number of agents whose clinical use has been approved in the past five years and of several agents that will undoubtedly be available within the next year By the very nature of time alotted the analysis had to be superficial I believe that it is important to view all the agents because they cross each other in uses I believe that areas of appropriate use exist for all of the compounds that I have discussed and I also believe that cost and convenience will play increasingly important roles in the selection of what agent is most fitting the definition of appropriate In many infections it will not be possible to show a significant difference among drugs in a class unless extremely large studies are undertaken From my review of the literature in preparation for this meeting I doubt these studies will be mounted The infectious disease clinician must be familiar with all of the agents so that he or she can make judgments about which agents makes the most sense for hisher hospital I believe that it is fitting and proper for the infectious disease physician to appropriate the correct selection methods of administration and dose of antibiotic in many clinical situations particularly ones in which parenteral agents are used I hope the IDSA will have an impact on the proper use of the quinolones monobactams penems and carbapenems Our goal in the use of antimicrobial agents should be the selection of agents for prophylaxis empiric therapy and therapy for defined infections in a manner that results in cure with reasonable cost and minimal damage to the microbial ecology
R539	The precursor molecule to the GnRH contains a peptide named GnRHassociated peptide GAP with PRLinhibiting properties In this work we have studied the electrophysiological properties and responses to GAP of three different types of PRLsecreting cells 1 the rat tumor cell line GH3 2 normal rat pituitary cells in primary culture and 3 human PRLsecreting adenoma cells Using different but complementary techniques we show that GAP reduces intracellular Ca levels Cai and inhibits Ca transients in these cells This reduction of Cai results from coordinate actions of GAP on K and Ca conductances and may explain the inhibitory effect of GAP on hormonal secretion by PRLsecreting cells
R540	A case of acute caffeine poisoning with resultant ventricular fibrillation and coma was treated by emergency hemoperfusion Clinical symptomatology improved dramatically with resolution of arrhythmias and return to normal consciousness over a fivehour period
R541	Duplex Doppler ultrasound US was used in 21 consecutive patients with renal masses including renal carcinoma n  9 metastases n  6 lymphoma n  4 angiomyolipoma n  1 and sarcoma n  1 Seven of the nine carcinomas had Doppler shifts of 4 kHz or more and were hypervascular or vascular These seven masses had significantly higher P less than 001 Doppler shifts than all the other malignant renal masses including the two avascular renal cell carcinomas Correlation with angiographic findings suggests that the highfrequency Doppler signals were associated with arteriovenous shunts Detection of the high Doppler shift seems to be a promising step in differentiating hypervascular renal carcinomas from other renal tumors
R542	Congenital anomalies of the gastrointestinal tract can pose serious threats to the health of newborn infants and children Perhaps nowhere has pediatric surgery had as dramatic an impact as in the care and treatment of these conditions The pediatric radiologist works closely with the surgeon in evaluating these anomalies in young children Plain radiographic films and contrast studies have been and remain the first step in studying these anomalies Newer imaging modalities however also have made contributions to the continuing importance of the role of the radiologist in the diagnosis and care of children with these anomalies
R543	The relative motion of 40nanometer gold beads bound to the exposed outer doublet microtubules of demembranated sea urchin sperm flagella has been observed and photographed during adenosine triphosphate ATPreactivated swimming This direct demonstration and measure of sliding displacements between outer doublet microtubules in actively bending flagella verifies the original sliding microtubule model for ciliary bending that was established by electron microscopy of fixed cilia and provides a new functional measure for the diameter of the flagellar axoneme of 132  8 nanometers
R544	The suppression of IL1 production in human adherent PBMC by a glucocorticoid hormone was studied From 105 to 108 M glucocorticoid hormone prednisolone inhibited both IL1 alpha and IL1 beta production by LPSstimulated adherent human PBMC in a dosedependent fashion as assayed by Western blotting of cellassociated IL1 and a thymocyte comitogenic bioassay IL1 alpha and beta mRNA levels were concomitantly suppressed by glucocorticoid treatment as determined by Northern blotting analysis These data suggest that the suppression of IL1 activity by glucocorticoids is consistently associated with decreased levels of IL1 proteins and mRNA expression and therefore presumably regulated at the transcriptional level
R545	We developed a monoclonal antibody 282 that binds specifically to the amidated carboxyl terminal region common to gastrin and cholecystokinin This immunoglobulin G1 antibody has high affinity ID50  3070 pM for gastrin and cholecystokinin peptides binds labeled gastrin similarly at 37 degrees C and 4 degrees C and shows minimal inhibition of binding in the presence of 40 canine serum Antibody 282 was used to carry out in vivo immunoneutralization studies in 8 dogs previously prepared with chronic gastric fistulas Preliminary studies revealed that a single intravenous dose of 075 mg of partially purified immunoglobulin G of monoclonal antibody 282 completely inhibited the acid stimulatory effect of exogenous gastrin17 given intravenously at 200 pmolkgh a physiologic dose and inhibited by 70 the acid response to a supraphysiologic dose 800 pmolkgh The same dose of antibody decreased the acid secretory response obtained during distention of the stomach with 300 ml of 58 glucose solution by 98 and decreased the response to distention with 300 ml of 8 peptone solution by 68 A 10fold higher dose of antibody decreased the acid response to peptone by 96 The gastrin antibody had no effect on the acid response to exogenous histamine A control antibody specific for the biologically inactive glycineextended gastrincholecystokinin peptapeptide region had no significant effect on gastric acid secretion stimulated by gastrin or by gastric distention with nutrients These studies indicate that circulating gastrin is of major importance in the gastric phase of gastric acid stimulation caused by distention of the stomach with nutrients
R546	Extracranial hematomas have variable CT appearances and may be confused with other entities MR imaging of 12 patients with intraabdominal or intrapelvic hemorrhages showed that intraabdominal hematomas develop a unique MR appearance after 3 weeks Nine hematomas imaged after this time all showed a characteristic concentricring configuration with a thin dark peripheral rim on all pulse sequences and a bright inner ring most distinctive on T1weighted images Six hematomas imaged during the first 3 weeks failed to show this architecture The concentric rings in MR images of chronic hematomas allowed a tissuespecific diagnosis
R547	We describe 2 patients who had coexistent rheumatoid arthritis and sickle cell disease Both patients developed sickle cell crises following intraarticular injection of corticosteroids to control their arthritis The mechanism of this phenomenon is not clear but it is suggested that intraarticular steroids be used with caution in patients with sickle cell disease
R548	We describe a case of histologically proven giant cell arteritis GCA in a 62yearold woman who initially presented with upper limb girdle pain and weakness and intermittent claudication Clinical improvement was obtained with oral prednisolone She subsequently developed a photosensitive rash and was diagnosed as having systemic lupus erythematosus The features of the two conditions and the possibility of an association are discussed
R549	The haemodynamic indices of three patients who developed abdominal tamponade as a result of intraabdominal bleeding following liver transplantation were measured on four occasions as the increased intraabdominal pressure was released Hypotension followed the release of the tamponade in all patients and was the result of a decrease in systemic vascular resistance This was treated with vasoconstrictors the response to various agents was monitored Treatment of hypotension following release of abdominal tamponade by volume replacement alone may be inappropriate and may lead to overtransfusion adrenaline may be the treatment of choice Intensive haemodynamic monitoring is advisable
R550	Sixty slides from 60 blocks taken from 30 colonic carcinomas were circulated twice to six histopathologists of varying experience Five of the six pathologists showed a good to excellent intraobserver agreement for assessment of the character of the invasive margin 044 less than kappa less than 082 which was not significantly affected by sampling 040 less than kappa less than 056 comparing both slides from each tumour or observer five of six pathologists agreeing on 46 of 60 slides Pathologists were unreliable in assessing peritumoural lymphocytic infiltrates with only two pathologists achieving moderate levels of intraobserver agreement 003 less than kappa less than 052 The interobserver agreement for peritumoural lymphocytic infiltrates was also low kappa less than 029 between the three most experienced pathologists The assessment of peritumoural lymphocytic infiltrates was significantly affected by sampling the two pathologists with the lowest intraobserver variation achieving kappa values of 021 and 010 between the 30 paired slides from each tumour The character of the invasive margin was reliably assessed was not dependent on sample and added useful prognostic information but peritumoural lymphocytic infiltration is not a reproducible observation and may therefore not add useful prognostic information in routine use
R551	Because both chemical and mechanical insults to the lung may occur concomitantly with trauma we hypothesized that the pressure threshold for vascular pressureinduced mechanical injury would be decreased after a chemical insult to the lung Normal isolated canine lung lobes N n  14 and those injured with either airway acid instillation AAI n  18 or intravascular oleic acid OA n  25 were exposed to short 5min periods of elevated venous pressure HiPv ranging from 19 to 130 cmH2O Before the HiPv stress the capillary filtration coefficient Kfc was 012  001 027  003 and 031  002 mlmin1cmH2O1 x 100 g1 and the isogravimetric capillary pressure Pci was 92  03 68  05 and 65  03 cmH2O in N AAI and OA lungs respectively However the pattern of response to HiPv was similar in all groups Kfc was no different from the preHiPv value when the peak venous pressure Pv remained less than 55 cmH2O but it increased reversibly when peak Pv exceeded 55 cmH2O P less than 005 The reflection coefficient sigma for total proteins measured after pressure exposure averaged 060  003 032  004 and 037  009 for N AAI and OA lobes respectively However in contrast to the result expected if pore stretching had occurred at high pressure in all groups the sigma measured during the HiPv stress when Pv exceeded 55 cmH2O was significantly larger than that measured during the recovery periodABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R552	Clearances of uncharged dextrans of broad size distribution were used to evaluate the effects of a 30 day course of enalapril on glomerular barrier function in 10 patients with IgA nephropathy and proteinuria from 14 to 56 gday Dextran clearance experiments were repeated three times before enalapril therapy after 30 days of enalapril and again 30 days after enalapril withdrawal GFR but not RPF was significantly reduced by enalapril basal 383  119 enalapril 302  126 mlmin173 m2 and returned to basal values after enalapril withdrawal Urinary protein excretion and fractional clearance of albumin were both significantly reduced by enalapril basal 23  11 gday and 102  90 x 105 enalapril 12  06 gday and 51  23 x 105 respectively and returned to basal values after enalapril withdrawal Transglomerular passage of large dextrans radii 54 to 62 A but not of lower size 26 to 42 A were significantly lowered by enalapril When enalapril was withdrawn the dextransieving profile returned comparable to the baseline levels A theoretical analysis of dextransieving profiles indicated that enalapril lowered the radius of largest membrane pores This effect was independent from glomerular hemodynamic changes We conclude that angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors CEI in humans with IgA nephropathy reduces urinary protein excretion by a primary action on the intrinsic glomerular membrane properties enhancing barrier sizeselective function The hypofiltration associated with enalapril therapy in these patients which was eliminated by its withdrawal has to be taken into account as a possible undesired effect of CEI in longterm treatment
R553	Continuous vectorcardiography was registered before and during the first 18 hours after cardiac surgery in 53 patients QRS vector changes QRSVD occurred during the operation but no further changes were observed postoperatively The ST vector STVM increased during the operation and a further slight increase occurred postoperatively Perioperative myocardial infarction occurred in three patients Their STVM was higher than the average in patients without myocardial infarction while QRSVD did not differ from the average pattern Twelve other patients were studied in pacemakerinduced moderate tachycardia QRSVD increased in proportion to heartrate changes rs median  093 p less than 001 QRSVD also correlated with myocardial oxygen uptake rs median  062 p less than 005 The STVM responses were not uniform The data suggest that vectorcardiogram variables can provide information related to myocardial energy metabolism
R554	Articular cartilage degeneration was studied in an experimental model including 68 knees of adult dogs on which five different types of medial meniscectomy had been performed with a followup period of 10 to 450 days The results were assessed by macroscopic radiologic and histologic methods The degenerative lesions increased proportionally to the amount of meniscal tissue resected and the duration of observation These lesions proved to be more intense at the tibial plateau compared to the femoral condyle For both joint surfaces the predominant location was the central zone Considering the degenerative process by the articular cartilage after total meniscectomy maximum preservation of meniscal tissue is recommended
R555	A 40yearold woman with a history of injury to the left foot was initially treated for an ankle sprain When the initial roentgenograms were reassessed os peroneum fracture with diastasis was diagnosed This may be the second case of fracture of the uncommon anomaly to be reported in the literature A fracture of the os peroneum may be confused with ankle sprain Only careful examination of serial roentgenograms may avoid an incorrect diagnosis and further complications
R556	Ten cardiac transplant patients have had bilateral total hip or knee surgery for treatment of osteonecrosis secondary to corticosteroid immunosuppression Nine had bilateral total hip arthroplasty and one had bilateral total knee arthroplasty for osteonecrosis of the tibial plateaus The only immediate postoperative complication was in a single hip patient who had a nonfatal pulmonary embolism Two patients died from cardiovascular causes the remaining eight had excellent results from arthroplasty with an average Harris hip rating of 95 at a mean followup period of 34 months No patient had required revision surgery and radiographic followup examination has revealed no evidence of loosening of any of these cemented arthroplasties One patient developed a late hematogeneous sepsis of one hip seven years after replacement from atypical mycobacterium three months following renal transplantation which was done 11 years after cardiac transplantation Total joint arthroplasty has resulted in excellent clinical and radiologic results in this patient population Despite the increased risks of major surgery in these immunocompromised transplant recipients total joint arthroplasty appears to be a safe and effective method of treatment of osteonecrosis of the hip
R557	Suramin has recently been used to treat patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome because of the action of this drug on reverse transcriptase Patients so treated developed the symptoms and hormonal profiles of adrenal insufficiency To evaluate the mechanism of action of suramin on adrenalcortical function adrenal mitochondrial and microsomal preparations from five subjects were assayed for steroidogenic enzyme activity in the presence and absence of suramin Specifically 3 betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenaseisomerase 17 alphahydroxylase 21hydroxylase 11 betahydroxylase and 1720desmolase activities were measured in the presence of 05000 mumolL suramin concentrations In all assays enzyme activities decreased in a dosedependent fashion as suramin concentrations increased The drug doses calculated that caused 50 inhibition of enzyme activity were 21hydroxylase activity 50 mumolL 17 alphahydroxylase activity 25 mumolL 1720desmolase activity 50 mumolL 11 betahydroxylase 2 mumolL and 3 betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenaseisomerase 1200 mumolL These results suggest that suramin has a concentrationdependent inhibitory effect on the key P450regulated enzymatic steps in adrenal glucocorticoid steroidogenesis which may explain the development of adrenal insufficiency in acquired immune deficiency syndrome patients treated with suramin
R558	A retrospective study of 100 consecutive nephrectomy patients showed a 20 catheterisation rate Of the 11 carried out postoperatively only 4 were for urinary retention The postoperative catheterisation rate for males was 71 and for females 2 The rate of postoperative retention was 44 which is much lower than that reported from other units This rate of postoperative catheterisation for retention is so low that in spite of the very mild increase in complications compared with intraoperative catheterisation the practice of routine prophylactic catheterisation of nephrectomy patients is unnecessary and cannot be recommended
R559	An endoscope was equipped with a salinefilled latex rubber balloon at its tip to displace contaminating blood bile or gastric contents during operative portoscopy biliary endoscopy or upper gastrointestinal endoscopy A fiber with its tip inside the balloon transmitted energy from an NdYAG laser for coagulation of tumors in one bile duct cancer in six portal vein growths from primary liver cancers and in a superficially growing stomach cancer The balloon increased the precision of irradiation by making lesions easier to identify through displacement of bile or blood and by keeping the fiber tip at a fixed position relative to the lesion The technique basic experimental studies and clinical experiences are reported
R560	Spermatogenesis can be turned on or off in the seasonally breeding golden Syrian hamster in a laboratory setting by exposure of animals to different photoperiod regimens The present study provides the first detailed quantitative analysis of the subcellular features of hamster Leydig cells during active and inactive phases of spermatogenesis and correlates these features with the endocrine activity of the same animals Conventional stereological principles and accepted morphometric techniques were used to determine changes in a variety of subcellular constituents of Leydig cells at the extreme phases of gonadal activity produced by maintaining adult hamsters in a long photoperiod 16 h of light 8 h of darkness or by exposing them to a short photoperiod 6 h of light 18 h of darkness for 1213 weeks Compared with Leydig cells from gonadally active animals Leydig cells obtained from the regressed testis showed a significant reduction in the absolute volume of nearly all of its organelles including nucleolus 770 mitochondria 500 total endoplasmic reticulum ER 864 cisternal ER 870 tubular ER 855 lipid 842 peroxisomes 825 multivesicular bodies 719 filamentrich area 955 and Golgi complex 694 There was also a significant reduction in organelle surface area namely outer 765 and inner 727 mitochondrial membrane total ER 850 cisternal 853 and tubular 844 forms of ER and Golgi complex 700 The surface areas of the plasma membrane and nuclear membrane were also decreased by 583 and 337 respectively These results demonstrate that the short photoperiodinduced cellular inactivity of Leydig cells is associated with an overall diminution in the volume and surface area of all major organelles not only those specifically associated with steroid biosynthesis Virtually every structural parameter of the Leydig cell was significantly and positively correlated with plasma LH levels and with both plasma and testicular concentrations of testosterone The total content of LH receptors per testis and per Leydig cell was reduced but the concentration of receptors per unit area of the Leydig cell surface remained unchanged Correlation of changes in hormonal status with alterations of all Leydig cell organelles suggests a general shutdown of cellular activity in the gonadally regressed animals rather than a specific effect of pituitary hormones on selected cellular constituents
R561	Nondiaphyseal osteoid osteomas lack the classic roentgenographic appearance of diaphyseal lesions This may delay diagnosis and treatment This paper reports on seven children with nondiaphyseal osteoid osteoma seen consecutively Delay in making the diagnoses once the children were examined by orthopedic surgeons averaged six months Absence of the classic roentgenographic appearance led to the delay in these cases The difficulty in diagnosing the lesion on routine roentgenograms derives from the specific reaction to the lesion by cancellous bone as compared to cortical bone Bone scans proved to be sensitive at locating a focal area of intense uptake but lacked the specificity to make the diagnosis Computed tomography CT was quite specific at making the diagnosis and localizing the lesion for biopsy How to differentiate between osteoid osteoma and osteomyelitis by CT is described When osteoid osteoma is suspected in nondiaphyseal locations CT is likely to aid in the diagnosis and localization of the lesion for biopsy
R562	Clinical and hemodynamic appearances of aortic regurgitation caused by serious aortic lesions ARAogroup seemed more deteriorated than those with isolated chronic aortic regurgitation ARgroup Often postoperative course and operative outcome are smooth and satisfactory in the ARAogroup To support this observation serial changes of left ventricular LV function and LV sphericity were evaluated before and after operation in ten cases in the ARAogroup and compared with those in the ARgroup Before operation there were no significant differences in LV function between the two groups Postoperative improvement of LV sphericity and LV function were statistically better in the ARAogroup The LV function reserve was considered sufficiently retained in the ARAogroup Results with this study supported that clinical observation Therefore the total correction at the same time of aortic incompetence and aortic lesions is recommended
R563	More than 20 species of the Legionellaceae family of bacteria have been discovered since the discovery of Legionella pneumophila Thirteen have been implicated as causative agents of pneumonia including the Pittsburgh pneumonia agent Tatlockia micdadei Legionella micdadei Although outbreaks of nosocomial pneumonia in immunosuppressed hosts have been welldescribed most cases have occurred sporadically in the community The spectrum of disease ranges from severe lifethreatening pneumonia to a selflimiting febrile illness Pontiac fever Isolation from the natural aquatic environment has preceded its discovery as agents of human disease in 6 species while environmental isolation has not yet been obtained for 3 species implicated in disease The mode of transmission is uncertain but cases of dual infection by L pneumophila and the newer species suggests that the epidemiology of these new organisms will be similar to that of L pneumophila The antibiotic of choice appears to be erythromycin The historical background epidemiology microbiology and clinical manifestations of these newlydiscovered organisms are reviewed in comparative fashion
R564	Lipoprotein mass concentrations were measured by analytical ultracentrifugation in a subset of 57 hypercholesterolaemic male participants in the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Type II Coronary Intervention Study 2year changes in levels of intermediatedensity lipoproteins IDL of flotation rate 1220 were strongly predictive of progression of coronary artery disease at 5 years Changes in serum mass concentrations of lowdensity lipoproteins LDL flotation rate 012 verylowdensity lipoproteins VLDL flotation rate 20400 highdensity lipoproteins HDL and the HDL2 and HDL3 subfractions did not differ significantly between men with and without definite progression of coronary artery disease The relation of IDL mass to disease progression remained significant p less than 005 after adjustment for group assignment to cholestyramine treatment or placebo and was only slightly reduced p less than or equal to 006 by adjustment for changes in LDL mass concentrations Changes in IDL mass and ratios of HDLcholesterol to totalcholesterol or LDLcholesterol were inversely correlated and had a similar ability to predict progression The findings are consistent with earlier evidence that IDL are directly involved in the development of coronary artery disease and suggest that ratios of HDLcholesterol to totalcholesterol or LDLcholesterol may be indicators of coronary disease risk partly owing to relations with IDL metabolism
R565	Data concerning risk factors for the development of cutaneous malignant melanoma MM were abstracted from published casecontrol studies Relative risks more appropriately odds ratios and 95 confidence intervals were quoted or calculated for each risk factor in each study Those risk factors that were reported to be significant in over half of the studies include phenotypic factors blue eyes blond or red hair light complexion freckles sun sensitivity and inability to tan personal history of nonmelanoma cutaneous cancer or precancer higher socioeconomic status increased numbers of nevocytic nevi and bursts of sun exposure Further study is needed on family history and personal history of MM these were not found to be significant risk factors in over half the reviewed casecontrol studies This review leaves out other undoubtedly important risk factors such as dysplastic nervus syndrome and race which need investigation by the casecontrol method Determination of risk factors allows the identification of that subset of the population most at risk for the development of MM Given the continued increase in the incidence of MM these data can help to focus preventive measures on the more susceptible subgroups of the population

R567	We studied 16 femora retrieved at postmortem from symptomless patients who had a satisfactory cemented total hip arthroplasty from two weeks to 17 years earlier with the aim of delineating the initial mechanisms involved in loosening Only one specimen showed radiographic evidence of loosening the other 15 were stable to mechanical testing at 170 Nm of torque In all 16 specimens the cementbone interface was intact with little fibrous tissue formation By contrast separation at the cementprosthesis interface and fractures in the cement mantle were frequent The most common early feature was debonding of the cement from the metal seen at the proximal and distal ends of the prosthesis Specimens which had been in place for longer also showed circumferential fractures in the cement near the cementmetal interface and radial fractures extending from this interface into the cement and sometimes to the bony interface The most extensive cement fractures appeared to have started at or near sharp corners in the metal or where the cement mantle was thin or incomplete Fractures were also related to voids in the cement The time relationship in this series suggested that longterm failure of the fixation of cemented femoral components was primarily mechanical starting with debonding at the interface between the cement and the prosthesis and continuing as slowly developing fractures in the cement mantle
R568	In this study we examined the effect of ACTH on the sensitivity of the testes to gonadotropin and determined the role of the testosterone T negative feedback system in mediating the inhibitory effect of ACTH on LH secretion in adult male rats ACTH infusion for 3 days reduced basal levels of serum T and the T response to GnRH but did not alter basal levels of serum LH immunoreactive or the LH response to GnRH These effects required the presence of the adrenal glands Infusion of corticosterone B at a dose that increased serum B concentrations 9fold had an effect similar to that of ACTH on basal serum T levels and the serum T response to GnRH Basal levels of serum LH and the serum LH response to GnRH were not affected by B administration These data suggest that ACTH administration reduces the sensitivity of the testes to LH resulting in a lower basal level of T and a reduced T response to GnRH This effect was independent of basal serum LH levels or the LH response to GnRH It appears that B mediates the effect of ACTH on testicular sensitivity to gonadotropin In another experiment ACTH administration for 4 days did not alter serum LH values but reduced serum T levels in shamcastrated male rats In contrast ACTH treatment blunted the increase in serum LH after castration by day 2 of treatment despite the absence of detectable levels of serum T within 6 h after castration These data suggest that T is not essential for the inhibitory effect of ACTH on LH secretion to occur They do not support the hypothesis that ACTH enhances the sensitivity of the hypothalamus andor pituitary to the negative feedback effects of T
R569	Vacuolar HATPases function in generating protonmotive force across the membranes of organelles connected with the vacuolar system of eukaryotic cells This family of HATPases is distinct from the two other families of HATPases the plasma membranetype and the eubacterialtype One of the subunits of the vacuolar HATPase binds NNdicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCCD and has been implicated in the protonconducting activity of these enzymes We have cloned and sequenced the gene encoding the DCCDbinding protein proteolipid of the HATPase of bovine chromaffin granules The gene encodes a highly hydrophobic protein of 15849 Da Hydropathy plots revealed four transmembrane segments one of which contains a glutamic residue that is the likely candidate for the DCCD binding site Sequence homology with the vacuolar proteolipid and with the proteolipids of eubacterialtype HATPases was detected The proteolipids from Escherichia coli spinach chloroplasts and yeast mitochondria matched better to the NH2terminal part of the vacuolar protein The proteolipids of bovine mitochondria and Neurospora mitochondria matched better to the COOHterminal end of the vacuolar proteolipid These findings suggest that the proteolipids of the vacuolar HATPases were evolved in parallel with the eubacterial proteolipid from a common ancestral gene that underwent gene duplication
R570	We analyzed DNA from nine FrenchCanadian probands from eastern Quebec province all had hyperphenylalaninemia phenylketonuria PKU or nonPKU forms caused by mutations at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus Analysis of RFLP haplotypes and mutations revealed a novel mutation an AtoG transition metval in codon 1 the translationinitiation codon It occurred on 5 of the 18 mutant chromosomes and was associated each time with haplotype 2 A proband homozygous for this mutation had the PKU phenotype In other probands the codon 1 mutation was inherited once with the splice junction mutation in exon 12 on haplotype 3 conferring PKU and was inherited twice with a mutation on haplotype 1 conferring PKU in one proband and nonPKU hyperphenylalaninemia in the other The other five probands carried mutations conferring PKU on the following haplotype combinations 13 twice 19 34 and 11 The mutations on haplotypes 1 4 and 9 are not yet characterized This preliminary study reveals a novel PKU mutation and considerable genetic heterogeneity at the phenylalanine hydroxylase locus in FrenchCanadians
R571	To evaluate gonadal function and pregnancy outcome after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia during childhood or adolescence 44 former patients who were less than 20 years of age at diagnosis 5 or more years from diagnosis and 18 or more years of age were contacted Thirtynine 88 provided information regarding pregnancy outcome Gonadal function as estimated by the ability to conceive or sire a pregnancy was not impaired despite treatment with substantial cumulative doses of methotrexate 6mercaptopurine vincristine and 1asparaginase Twelve patients reported a total of 27 pregnancies There were four spontaneous abortions one stillborn and 22 liveborn infants The birthweights were 1928 to 4536 g median 3430 g Two infants had congenital anomalies The childrens ages ranged from 1 month to 10 years 2 months median 6 years 1 month None has been diagnosed with any type of childhood cancer The results of this study suggest that pregnancy outcome is not affected adversely by treatment received during childhood or adolescence for acute lymphoblastic leukemia
R572	HLA class II antigens were determined in 65 patients with biopsyproven giant cell arteritis GCA An increase in DR4 antigen frequency was found in the patients 40 compared with that in 200 healthy controls 20 Pcorr less than 005 DR4 was significantly more frequent in GCA patients with polymyalgia rheumatica PMR than in those without PMR 588 versus 193 P less than 0005 HLADR4 frequency in GCA patients without PMR was similar to that in the control population 20 Patients with severe disabling PMR had DR4 more frequently 90 than did those with moderate symptoms who required medical care because of cranial arteritis manifestations 416 P less than 005 We conclude that in GCA patients association with DR4 is mainly related to the manifestation of the disease as PMR We discuss clinical and immunogenetic similarities between PMR and other DR4associated rheumatic disorders Common immunopathogenic mechanisms leading to clinical overlap among them are suggested
R573	The large flap sculptured facelift is a redraping rather than a pinching or pulling operation The skin flaps are redraped over the tightened sculptured underlying fatmusculoaponeurosis This procedure can be performed on a majority of patients with minimal complications
R574	A simple and safe method of nasal provocation for outpatients that requires no special equipment is described A total of 2645 cases were tested by nasal provocation tests Of the total 1175 were tested with Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus 825 with mixed grass pollens 352 with plantain Plantago lanceolata and 125 for cats and correlating nasal tests with skin tests yielded 80 90 and 85 respectively Immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis was only considered justifiable when the nasal provocation test was positive The nasal provocation test was repeated at the end of the normal course of injections recommended by the manufacturer If the nasal provocation test was still positive further injections were given until the test became negative This method of improving diagnostic accuracy and monitoring results of immunotherapy was used with both aqueous extracts which were used for skin testing Australian Government Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and with Allpyral pyridineextracted alumprecipitated extracts Dome Laboratories England The number of injections of allergen required to convert a positive nasal provocation test to negative varied from 26 to 69 for mite aqueous injections with only 12 to 19 for mite suspension and 47 to 98 for grass aqueous injections compared with 12 to 36 for grass suspension Direct provocation tests of the nose should give a more accurate diagnosis than RAST or skin tests and are required for monitoring therapy because considerable individual variations in sensitivity and response to treatment were demonstrated Standard dosage schedules are not suitable for individual patients who should have their immunotherapy personalized
R575	A patient with large granular lymphocyte LGL leukemia that transformed into an acute or aggressive form after 20 months of the chronic phase is reported The patients leukemic cells were mature mediumsized lymphocytes with sparse azurophil granules and the surface phenotypes of the cells were CD2 CD3 CD11 and CD16 Molecular analysis showed a germ line configuration in both Tcell receptor betachain genes and Tcell receptor tauchain genes A clonal anomaly of chromosome trisomy 8 was demonstrated in peripheral blood cells LGL after acute transformation of the disease displayed large blastic morphology with prominent nucleoli intense basophilic cytoplasm and numerous granules Karyotypic analysis demonstrated a mosaic of trisomy 8 and trisomy 8 with an additional marker chromosome Thus transformation of chronic LGL leukemia into an acute or aggressive form in this patient was associated with morphologic and karyotypic changes of the leukemic cells Patients with a stable form of chronic LGL leukemia should be examined carefully for the possible acute crisis associated with a clonal evolution
R576	In the intact adult male rat cyclosporine CsA induces a significant decrease in serum testosterone T serum LH and intratesticular T To elucidate the mechanism of action of this CsAinduced hypogonadotropic hypogonadism castrated male rats were treated with oral CsA 30 mgkgday or vehicle alone and serum LH was measured after 1 2 and 4 weeks of treatment Surprisingly serum LH was higher in these CsAtreated castrated rats at 1 2 and 4 weeks than in castrated controls To provide insight into the cause of this increase in serum LH a T implant 8 mm was inserted at week 5 of treatment in both CsAtreated and control castrated animals and serum LH was measured 1 week after insertion of the T implant Serum LH levels decreased to control values after insertion of the T implant Subsequently two other groups of rats received 8mm T implant at the time of castration and were then treated up to 4 weeks with either CsA or vehicle alone Serum LH showed a significant decrease in these CsA plus Ttreated animals compared to the vehicle plus Ttreated animals A GnRH stimulation test performed after 2 weeks of CsAvehicle treatment showed a significant increase in serum LH in all the rats 30 min after GnRH administration 1 10 30 and 100 ng100 g BW ip indicating a normal pituitary response The increase in LH after exogenous GnRH treatment was more significant in CsAtreated intact rats than in the controls There was no difference in creatinine clearance between intact and castrate Ttreated rats regardless of whether they received CsA These studies indicate that the hypogonadotropic hypogonadism induced by CsA in intact male rats is mediated through the hypothalamicpituitary axis primarily at its hypothalamus end does not seem to be due to the nephrotoxicity of CsA and is modulated by T andor its metabolites
R577	Arthroscopic laser surgery was performed in 325 knee joints between January 1985 and August 1988 with no significant lasting complications The CO2 laser is especially effective in the tight knee for high surface area low volume lesions and chondromalacia Arthroscopic laser surgery is also being performed as part of a multicenter study Although the results are satisfactory to date the use of the laser on the spine and joints other than the knee and for PMMA removal is experimental
R578	To evaluate the reliability of phosphorus31 magnetic resonance MR spectroscopy in the assessment of acute testicular ischemia vascular integrity and spermatogenesis the authors studied in vivo canine and primate testicles grouped as follows group 1 testes n  8 in situ canine controls group 2 n  11 canine testes subjected to warm ischemia group 3 canine n  4 and primate n  4 testicles from hormonetreated animals Group 1 control testicles showed high monophosphoester MP levels low levels of inorganic phosphate Pi phosphodiester PD and phosphocreatine and high levels of adenosine triphosphate ATP Group 2 testes revealed a timedependent decay of MPPi ratios from 21 to 070 Regeneration of ATP was noted in the acute reperfusion period After 6 weeks of pituitary gonadotropin suppression group 3 testes showed a significant decrease P less than 05 in MPPD ratios from a control level of 26  03 and a decrease in the MPbetaATP ratio from 24  01 to 18  03 P31 MR spectroscopy appears to be a potential method for noninvasively assessing testicular ischemic injury and the metabolic integrity of spermatogenesis

R580	Chronic pain patients and brain injured patients frequently exhibit anxiety depression perseveration and fixed ideation about their injuries Both populations also frequently suffer from decreased attention impaired concentration easy fatigability personality changes impaired relationships with family and friends and difficulty maintaining a job In cases where chronic pain coexists with traumatic brain injury the brain injury is often obscured Risk factors which should alert the medical team to possible coexisting brain injury include history of loss of consciousness at original injury history of trauma to the head whiplash injury to the neck multisystem trauma and admission of memory or attention deficits by the patient When any of these risk factors are present we have found that formal examination of cognitive function is required to explore the potential of coexisting brain injury if pain is a prominent clinical feature residual cognitive sequelae of mild brain injury is easily masked Specific testing of attention new learning ability constructional ability and higher cognitive functions are most helpful in this population and they need to be included in the mental status examination when concomitant brain injury is suspected In our study seven patients were found to have undiagnosed brain injury in a series of 67 consecutive patient referrals to our pain rehabilitation program Treatment failure is high in this subgroup of pain patients unless treatment is directed toward the sequelae of both brain injury and chronic pain
R581	A prerequisite for the development of an implantable artificial pancreas is the availability of a stable longlife glucose sensor Platinum Pt catalyzed electrodes have been demonstrated in vitro to show high sensitivity to glucose and long cycle life but are more sensitive to coreactants compared with enzymatic methods The authors developed a special data processing method compensated net charge ratio or CNCR in which the measured electrode response is very sensitive to glucose completely insensitive to urea and only moderately sensitive to amino acids Other endogenous and exogenous coreactants show only minor interferences The CNCR method involves the determination of the ratio of net oxidation charge to total charge during one complete cycle of a cyclic voltammogram Prototype electrodes tested in vitro in spiked plasma have shown typical sensitivities of greater than 2 x 104 CNCR units per 1 mgdl change in glucose concentration with linear response up to 400 mgdl For in vivo testing a modified 5 F vascular catheter with membrane covered surface mounted electrodes was used at a vena cava site in swine Several sensor designs were tested in vivo with sensitivities of 15 x 104 CNCR units mgdl
R582	In a phase 1 study seven patients with classical rheumatoid arthritis were treated with intravenous 3amino1hydroxypropylidene11bisphosphonate APD Following this treatment bone resorption as measured by fasting urine calciumcreatinine and hydroxyprolinecreatinine ratios was reduced This was sustained for 6 months in only three patients Elevations of these ratios often coincided with flares of active arthritis in the remaining four patients Bone turnover as measured by serum osteocalcin levels was reduced in all patients but serum alkaline phosphatase levels remained unchanged There was no consistent improvement in clinical indices of disease activity
R583	We examined the effect of sustained hypoxemia with progressive acidemia on pituitaryadrenal endocrine function adrenocorticotropic hormone cortisol and on adrenal blood flow in fetal sheep Hypoxemia was induced by the maternal sheep breathing a gas mixture containing 9 oxygen with 3 carbon dioxide added Induced hypoxemia resulted in a progressive fetal metabolic acidosis but with little change in maternal pH During induced hypoxemia there was little change in maternal plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone or cortisol level Fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol increased to peak values within 28 hours of induced hypoxia but by 72 hours had begun to fall to values that were not significantly different from those at 14 hours Fetal adrenal blood flow microsphere technique also increased significantly and remained elevated throughout the duration 72 hours of hypoxemia The maximum fetal adrenal blood flow achieved during hypoxemia was significantly correlated with the basal prehypoxemia flow to the adrenals We conclude that the changes in fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone cortisol and adrenal blood flow seen in shortterm hypoxemia are reproduced during sustained hypoxemia with acidemia Furthermore the noted rise in the fetal adrenocorticotropic hormone level may be an important factor contributing to the increase in adrenal blood flow during hypoxemia
R584	Sera from some patients with systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases have antibodies against nuclear antigens An example is antiSm sera which recognize proteins associated with small nuclear RNA molecules small nuclear ribonucleoprotein snRNP particles In this paper antiSm sera were used to probe immunoblots of various rat tissues A previously unidentified Mr 28000 polypeptide was recognized by these antiSm sera This polypeptide referred to as N is expressed in a tissuespecific manner being most abundant in rat brain less so in heart and undetectable in the other tissues examined Immunoprecipitation experiments using antibodies directed against the cap structure of small nuclear RNAs have demonstrated that N is a snRNPassociated polypeptide AntiSm serum was also used to isolate a partial cDNA clone lambda rb91 from a rat brain phage lambda gt11 cDNA expression library On RNA blots the 450basepair cDNA insert of this clone hybridized to a 1600nucleotide mRNA species with an identical tissue distribution to N suggesting that lambda rb91 encodes at least part of N A longer cDNA clone was obtained by rescreening the library with lambda rb91 In vitro transcription and subsequent translation of this subcloned longer insert pGMA2 resulted in a protein product with the same electrophoretic and immunological properties as N confirming that pGMA2 encodes N The tissue distribution of N and the involvement of snRNP particles in nuclear premRNA processing may imply a role for N in tissuespecific premRNA splicing
R585	It has been postulated that neardrowning in fresh water may cause hemodilution and hypervolemia due to the hypotonicity of the aspirated water In contrast neardrowning in seawater because of its hypertonicity may lead to hypovolemic shock We evaluated the hemodynamic effects of the instillation of 20 mLkg of solutions of various tonicities sterile water 0225 sodium chloride 045 sodium chloride normal saline 2 sodium chloride and 3 sodium chloride into the lungs of anesthetized dogs and compared the results with those for control animals who were made anoxic for five minutes There was no difference in the hemodynamic effects of hypotonic isotonic or hypertonic solutions when compared with anoxic controls There was an immediate fall in cardiac output and increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure central venous pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance regardless of the solution which was statistically the same as the changes in the anoxic controls P greater than 02 Likewise the effective dynamic compliance of the lungs decreased precipitously was indistinguishable between solutions and was not statistically different from the anoxic controls P greater than 10 The pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and central venous pressure peaked at ten minutes and then declined gradually over four hours independent of the tonicity of the aspirated fluid The cardiac output and effective dynamic compliance of the lung dropped rapidly and remained depressed throughout the experiment and the pulmonary vascular resistance gradually worsened throughout the four hours of study Similar results occurred with the anoxic controls The cardiovascular changes that occur with neardrowning and aspiration of water are not dependent on the tonicity of the aspirated fluid but are the direct result of anoxia
R586	We have used a retroviral vector carrying the adenovirus E1A oncogene and the neomycin phosphotransferase gene to establish a human thyroidderived cell line that exhibits TSHmediated cAMP generation as well as the differential expression of HLA class II antigens in response to recombinant gammainterferon Twentytwoweek gestation histologically confirmed human fetal thyroid was collagenase digested cultured as a monolayer and infected directly with 12S or 13S E1Acontaining retrovirus constructs Infected clones n  30 were selected in a hormonesupplemented medium containing bovine TSH bTSH 1 mUml 10 fetal bovine serum and 05 mgml G418 antibiotic A rapidly growing clone designated 12S was chosen for detailed analysis over 18 months of continuous culture The 12S clone was sensitive to less than 10 microUml bTSH when assessed by extracellular accumulation of cAMP but TSH had no influence on 72h incorporation of 3Hthymidine Clone 12S responded to recombinant human gammainterferon 1104 Uml by induction of HLA DR alphachainspecific mRNA and the surface expression of HLADR antigen detected by fluorescein isothiocyanatelabeled monoclonal antibody to nonpolymorphic HLADR regions using flow cytometry These studies indicate the potential for immortalizing human thyroid cells for use as targets of antiTSH receptor immune responses and for long term studies of human throcyte HLA gene regulation
R587	Stress injury to the extensor mechanism is common and we expect it to become more so as adolescent athletes train earlier and more vigorously The clinical and radiographic findings of a number of these stress injuries are described Our young athletes challenge us to continue studying these stress injuries with the goal of offering them more effective preventative programs The success of our study will probably lie in the areas of stretching cross training and strength programs
R588	A newly recognized disorder of black scalp hair is characterized by the irregularly alternating segmentation of hair into dark and light bands A 15yearold girl had segmented heterochromic scalp hair in association with irondeficiency anemia The clinical and laboratory investigations support the view that low serum iron levels play a critical role in reducing eumelanogenesis and in the possible failure of melanin transfer The segmented heterochromic hair recovered completely after iron supplementation which coincided with increased eumelanogenesis in the recovered hair This clinical experience indicated participation of iron in the kinetics of melanogenesis within the follicular melanocytes
R589	To examine the manner in which changes in diastolic performance can contribute to the effect of vasodilation in patients with left ventricular LV systolic dysfunction we examined the effect of acute inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme with intravenous enalaprilat on early LV diastolic filling We studied 43 patients with congestive heart failure and depressed LV systolic function mean ejection fraction  SD 024  006 performing radionuclide ventriculography before and after administration of 125 mg intravenous enalaprilat We measured the effect of enalaprilat on the maximum rate of early LV diastolic filling normalized in four different ways and related these changes to both LV and right ventricular RV volumes Enalaprilat induced a small but statistically significant reduction in LV endsystolic volume and increase in LV ejection fraction For the entire patient group there was no significant change in LV peak filling rate after enalaprilat administration For individual patients however the effect of enalaprilat on peak filling rate was related to resting RV enddiastolic and endsystolic volumes In patients with enlarged RV enddiastolic volumes greater than or equal to 120 mlm2 mean peak filling rate increased from 138  06 to 171  06 enddiastolic volumes EDVsec and from 244  131 to 297  162 mlsecm2 after enalaprilat administration whereas no change in mean peak filling rate was observed in patients with nondilated RVs These observations were present regardless of the method of normalizing peak filling rate Thus the response of LV peak filling rate to enalaprilat is influenced by the presence of RV dilatationABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R590	Current methods of measuring cardiac output require the invasive insertion of a thermodilution catheter with its concomitant risks and complications We examined the noninvasive method of transthoracic electrical bioimpedance TEB in comparison with thermodilution cardiac outputs in a sample of 44 critically ill patients with poor left ventricular function left ventricular ejection fraction less than 30 and with either ischemic or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy Dyspnea mitral regurgitation tricuspid regurgitation and difference between real and ideal weight had the most marked effects on the correlation between the two methods with lesser influence by left ventricular ejection fraction height weight hemoglobin hematocrit and aortic regurgitation TEB and thermodilution cardiac outputs were correlated at r  051 p less than 000009 but the low reliability and low percentage of TEB readings within 05 Lmin of thermodilution cardiac outputs 31 renders TEB inadequate for clinical measurement of cardiac outputs in this patient population
R591	We studied the effects of natural and recombinant human IL2 rIL2 on secretion of prostacyclin PGI2 vWf and tissuetype plasminogen activator tPA IL2 elicited a steady increase in PGI2 synthesis by cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells HUVECS and bovine aortic endothelial cells but had no effect on vWf or tPA Both purified natural IL2 nIL2 and rIL2 induced significant PGI2 synthesis Substitution of the cysteine residue at position 125 of rIL2 with serine or alanine led to loss of PGI2stimulatory activity in HUVECS without affecting thymidine incorporation in lymphocytes HPLC analysis of arachidonate metabolites detected predominantly 6 ketoPGF1 alpha 6KPGF1 alpha peak Treatment of cultured endothelial cells with cycloheximide and actinomycin D resulted in inhibition of 6KPGF1 alpha synthesis The Western blot using a polyclonal antibody against PGH synthase revealed an increment in the 70kD subunit of PGH synthase by nIL2 and rIL2 but not by alaninesubstituted rIL2 We conclude that IL2 stimulated sustained PGI2 production by a mechanism that includes the de novo synthesis of PGH synthase This mechanism for regulating AA metabolism probably has important physiologic implications
R592	The unusually wide 80fold species variation observed by others 12 in the neuromuscular NM potency of diadonium a nondepolarizing muscle relaxant MR between cat and man suggested that the site and mechanism of its NM effect may vary in different species To obtain information on this question the NM potency of diadonium and the reversibility of its NM effect by neostigmine andor 4aminopyridine 4AP was investigated on the in vitro phrenic nervehemidiaphragm preparations of rats mice and guinea pigs The concentration of diadonium that caused 90 NM block IC90 was much greater in guinea pigs 174  002 and 128  001 mu when the preparations were stimulated with single stimuli at 01 Hz or with 01 s trains of 50 Hz tetani every 10 s respectively than in rats IC90  624  089 and 521  100 microM or mice IC90  519  098 and 444  022 microM In guinea pigs the NM blocking effect of diadonium could be antagonized by neostigmine This indicates that in this species the NM blocking effect of diadonium is primarily caused by inhibition of the interaction of acetylcholine ACh released by the nerve impulse with the cholinergic receptors cholinoceptors of the postjunctional membrane pjm By contrast in rats and mice diadonium was not antagonized by neostigmine but was reversed by 4aminopyridine This suggests that in these species in contrast to other nondepolarizing MR diadonium does not inhibit NM transmission postsynaptically but by inhibiting the positive nicotinic feedback mechanism of mobilization of ACh from reserve depots to release sites causes a presynaptic NM blockABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R593	Gliomatosis cerebri syn astrocytomatosis cerebri is a rare diffuse neoplastic condition affecting all parts of the brain The clinical and pathological features of an unusually diffuse and histologically uniform case of gliomatosis cerebri are presented Many tumour cells stained positively for glial fibrillary acid protein confirming the astrocytic derivation of this neoplasm Differing views on the nature of gliomatosis cerebri are briefly discussed
R594	Lipidlowering agents can be used safely and effectively if the physician understands the nature of the patients disorder and the mechanism of action of the various drugs The benefits of altering lipid levels are manifested over years not months Without a longterm plan for periodic followup and intervention shortterm gains will accomplish very little
R595	Loss of consciousness is rare in the absence of transient or persistent insult to the diencephalon or mesencephalon We found three patients with severe atherosclerotic stenosis or occlusion of both internal carotid arteries who experienced brief loss of consciousness Common characteristics were the absence of clinical or electroencephalographic seizure activities significant cardiovascular disease or a history suggestive of vasovagal syncope Angiographically the patients had widely patent vertebrobasilar circulation and collaterals from vertebrobasilar to carotid circulation Episodic loss of consciousness disappeared after carotid endarterectomy We concluded that bilateral hemispheric ischemia caused brief loss of consciousness but selective focal ischemia in the subcortical structures superimposed on widespread bihemispheric ischemia may have been responsible Since loss of consciousness is rare in carotid occlusive diseases systemic and vertebrobasilar causes must be carefully ruled out in each instance
R596	In the in vitro perfused rectal gland of the dogfish shark Squalus acanthias the adenosine analogue 2chloroadenosine 2Clado completely and reversibly inhibited forskolinstimulated chloride secretion with an IC50 of 5 nM Other A1 receptor agonists including cyclohexyladenosine CHA Nethylcarboxamideadenosine NECA and Rphenylisopropyladenosine RPIA also completely inhibited forskolin stimulated chloride secretion The S stereoisomer of PIA SPIA was a less potent inhibitor of forskolin stimulated chloride secretion consistent with the affinity profile of PIA stereoisomers for an A1 receptor The adenosine receptor antagonists 8phenyltheophylline and 8cyclopentyltheophylline completely blocked the effect of 2Clado to inhibit forskolinstimulated chloride secretion When chloride secretion and tissue cyclic cAMP content were determined simultaneously in perfused glands 2Clado completely inhibited secretion but only inhibited forskolin stimulated cAMP accumulation by 3440 indicating that the mechanism of inhibition of secretion by 2Clado is at least partially cAMP independent Consistent with these results A1 receptor agonists only modestly inhibited 915 forskolin stimulated adenylate cyclase activity and 2Clado markedly inhibited chloride secretion stimulated by a permeant cAMP analogue 8chlorophenylthio cAMP 8CPT cAMP These findings provide the first evidence for a high affinity A1 adenosine receptor that inhibits hormone stimulated ion transport in a model epithelia A major portion of this inhibition occurs by a mechanism that is independent of the cAMP messenger system
R597	To reduce the transmission of nonA nonB NANB hepatitis the American Association of Blood Banks AABB has recommended that donors be screened for elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase ALT and for the presence of antibody to hepatitis B core antigen antiHBc In this survey of 5336 donors the authors report the impact of using both of these surrogate tests on a heterogeneous donor population that was composed of white black Hispanic and Asian donors Hispanic and male donors had relatively high ALT levels and black and Asian donors had a higher prevalence of antiHBc than their respective counterparts The overall impact of using both surrogate tests resulted in a discard rate of 121 with a disproportionately high percentage of Hispanic and male donors excluded because of ALT testing and black and Asian donors because of antiHBc testing It appears that surrogate testing has a much greater impact on blood collection facilities that rely considerably on Hispanic Asian black or male donors than those that largely draw white or female donors
R598	BALBcJ mice which are homozygous for Lshs on chromosone 1 are genetically susceptible to Leishmania donovani S3 but spontaneously reduce their parasite burdens late in the course of infection Spleens from chronically infected mice 5 to 8 mo were found to have T cells that responded to leishmanial Ag by proliferating and secreting immune IFN An IFNsecreting T cell line derived from the spleen of a chronically infected mouse after boosting with leishmanial Ag and treatment with Pentostam to kill residual parasites was able to activate macrophages to kill amastigotes in vitro Furthermore after adoptive transfer of this cell line naive BALBcJ mice challenged with amastigotes demonstrated a 42fold reduction in parasite burden compared to controls Four of five clones derived from the protective T cell line secreted IFN and proliferated between days 7 and 14 after Ag stimulation All clones were Ly12 L3T4 Another T cell line which had Ly12 L3T4 phenotype was derived from the lymph nodes of sc immunized uninfected mice It multipled but never produced IFN in response to leishmanial Ag and failed to protect macrophages against L donovani infection in vitro or in vivo This nonprotective T cell line and the fifth clone from the protective line which also did not secrete IFN proliferated between days 2 and 7 after Ag stimulation In summary leishmaniaresponsive helperinducer T cells which produced IFN but were slow to proliferate in response to Ag in vitro and which were able to activate macrophages to reduce amastigotes in vitro and in vivo are present in chronically infected BALBcJ mice and may mediate the decrease in parasite burden during chronic infection
R599	Technetium99m ethyl cysteinate dimer ECD has high initial cerebral uptake with slow clearance in nonhuman primates suggesting ideal characteristics for single photon emission computer tomography SPECT imaging We evaluated the biodistribution dosimetry and scintigraphic pattern of 99mTcECD in normal subjects and the accuracy of SPECT imaging in patients with chronic cerebral infarction Sixteen normal subjects were injected with approximately 10 mCi of 99mTcECD Anterior and posterior singlepass wholebody images were obtained at multiple times after injection Blood clearance of the radiotracer was rapid falling to 100  66 and 49  11 of the injected dose at 2 and 60 min respectively Brain uptake was 64  21 of the injected dose 5 min after injection The critical organ was the urinary bladder Technetium99m ECD SPECT was performed with a rotating gamma camera in ten of the 16 normal subjects and 34 patients with clinical and CT evidence of chronic stroke Thirtythree of the thirtyfour patients had focal 99mTcECD abnormalities on SPECT 971 based on visual inspection of the SPECT images In summary we obtained high quality SPECT images as a result of the optimal physical and biologic characteristics of the tracer Technetium99m ECD SPECT shows promise for the evaluation of patients with stroke
R600	A survey was conducted to measure the drug therapy education preferences of a diverse group of professionals interested in the elderly Two hundred fortyfour surveys were mailed and 119 were returned 488 percent Seventytwo percent of the respondents were social workers four percent were registered nurses the remainder of the respondents 24 percent were nonhealth professionals Most respondents liked all common methods of instruction except selfdirected activities and large group discussions The five topics of greatest interest were drug interactions adverse drug effects drugs used to treat depression drugs used to treat nervousness or anxiety and drugs used to manage dementia A survey is an economical means of assessing the preferences of an unfamiliar audience The methods used to determine content for this program can be used by educators who are planning programs for similar audiences made up of health and nonhealth professionals
R601	Concentrations of interleukin 6 IL6 in cerebrospinal fluid CSF and serum of infants and children with bacterial meningitis were determined and correlations were sought with other indices of inflammation and with outcome Fortytwo patients ages 1 month to 15 years mean 25 years were studied IL6 activity was detectable greater than 50 unitsml in 30 of 36 CSF samples collected at admission from patients with meningitis and in 1 of 23 controls with fever and normal CSF findings Mean values were 36000 unitsml range 151156000 IL6 activity in CSF persisted during the first 5 days of illness IL6 concentrations at admission were not associated with clinical findings CSF leukocyte protein and glucose concentrations serum Creactive protein concentration and neurologic complications or sequelae IL6 was also detected in the serum of 3 of 14 patients with meningitis and in 0 of 7 controls with no infectious disease The presence of IL6 was not associated with bacteremia or with duration of fever before admission The presence of IL6 in the CSF of pediatric patients with bacterial meningitis is in accordance with available data on other cytokines and suggests their role as mediators of meningeal inflammation
R602	The human genes for the hematopoietic growth factors interleukin3 IL3 IL5 and granulocytemacrophage colonystimulating factor GMCSF have been mapped to 5q2331 We present in situ hybridization evidence that the human IL4 gene is located at 5q233312 suggesting that the four cytokine genes may be closely linked We used pulsedfield gel electrophoresis to prepare subchromosomal restriction maps surrounding these genes to define this possible linkage more precisely The IL4 and IL5 genes are tightly linked being 90 to 240 kilobases kb apart as has been shown for the IL3 and GMCSF genes which are only 9 kb apart Possible overlap of the map containing the IL4 and IL5 genes with restriction sites 5 to the IL3 gene suggests that the four cytokine genes may be localized within 500 kb of each other The endothelial cell growth factor gene ECGF which has also been localized to the 5q31 region did not appear to be close to the cytokine genes Linkage of the IL3 IL4 IL5 and GMCSF genes has important implications in the evolutionary origin and regulation of expression of these genes The four cytokine genes are located in the region of the long arm of chromosome 5 which is deleted in the 5q anomaly The present study provides a basis for further investigations of this disorder
R603	Clinical pharmacy services and pharmacotherapy specialists did not begin in primary care settings Rather the initial interdisciplinary teams took root in large hospitals and tertiary medical center inpatient services during the middle 1960s By the early 1970s however numerous papers appeared that described a unique and exciting practice model that incorporated primary care physicians and clinical pharmacists The sole purpose of the interdisciplinary concept was to allow each member to contribute their own expertise to improve patient care In my experience primary care physicians have been eager to consult clinical pharmacists and other health professionals I believe that the reason for this is a fundamental philosophy that distinguishes these physicians from other medical specialists Ingrained in their philosophy are concepts such as continuity of care and care of the entire patient The latter relates not only to multiple organ systems but also the spiritual and behavioral characteristics of the person The primary care physician is also viewed as the coordinator for all health care services required by their patients Most primary care physicians welcome others expertise as long as they continue to be the health care coordinator for the patient The health care structure of the United States continues to shift to ambulatory care This will provide additional opportunities for the types of group models described in this article After 20 years the positive impact that physician and pharmacotherapist teams can have on drug therapy is being recognized on a broader scale These models should continue to move from the academic laboratory to private group practiceABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R604	Mental health professionals often must decide whether to release a psychiatric patient who has been committed for treatment on the basis of being mentally ill and dangerous This decision involves liability risks if the patient becomes violent after release The author draws together several recommendations made in the literature regarding the careful development and implementation of hospital release procedures including 1 special consultation at the policy development stage 2 preemptive judgments regarding the adequacy of hospital policies in relation to the professional standard of care and 3 the use of videotaped exit interviews with patients at the time of their release
R605	The clinical features of patients treated with streptokinase for chest pain and anterior STsegment elevation who subsequently develop nonQwave infarction are unknown Of the 75 consecutive patients who initially presented with chest pain and STsegment elevation in the anterior leads V1V6 I aVL and were treated with intravenous streptokinase time from symptoms to treatment averaged less than 3 hours 32 43 developed a nonQwave and 43 57 a Qwave myocardial infarction Twenty seven of 32 patients 84 from the nonQwave group and 39 of 43 91 from the Qwave group were studied by angiography at 516  288 days after the onset of myocardial infarction Left ventricular enddiastolic pressure was 13  6 vs 20  7 mm Hg p less than 0001 left ventricular ejection fraction was 60  8 vs 49  14 p less than 0001 and the infarct vessel patency rate was 85 vs 72 p  044 in patients with a nonQ versus a Qwave infarction respectively In summary when patients presenting with chest pain and STsegment elevation are treated with streptokinase a significant portion of these symptoms will evolve into a nonQwave infarction Patients with a nonQwave infarction will have a better preserved left ventricular function than patients who develop a Qwave infarction This suggests the need for equal distribution of such patients in randomized trials of thrombolytic therapy for acute myocardial infarction to avoid misinterpreting data between groups
R606	The 10yearold Victoria Australia granny flat program has about 3000 units in place Granny flats designed as standardized units using panels offer privacy yet proximity to family members There are suggestions they be considered as affordable housing for younger people This review of the Victoria program suggests that state initiatives are more successful than local ones and that decentralized administration is associated with increased ability to delivery the granny flat units

R608	These experiments were conducted to determine whether point mutations activating Kras or Hras oncogenes induced by the procarcinogen 12dimethylhydrazine DMH were detectable in preneoplastic or neoplastic rat colonic mucosa Rats were injected weekly with diluent or DMH at 20 mgkg body wt for 5 10 15 or 25 wk killed and their colons dissected DNA was extracted from diluentinjected control animals histologically normal colonic mucosa from carcinogentreated animals and from carcinomas Ras mutations were characterized by differential hybridization using allelespecific oligonucleotide probes to polymerase chain reactionamplified DNA and confirmed by DNA sequencing While no Hras mutations were detectable in any group Kras G to A mutations were found in 66 of DMHinduced colon carcinomas These mutations were at the second nucleotide of codons 12 or 13 or the first nucleotide of codon 59 of the Kras gene The same type of Kras mutations were observed in premalignant colonic mucosa from 2 out of 11 rats as early as 15 wk after beginning carcinogen injections when no dysplasia adenomas or carcinomas were histologically evident suggesting that ras mutation may be an early event in colon carcinogenesis
R609	We treated three patients with severe ocular injuries caused by exploding glass bottles containing a mixture of dry ice chips and water One patient had a corneal laceration and traumatic cataract with several retained intraocular glass fragments The second had a scleral laceration without corneal or lenticular involvement The third suffered a cornealscleral laceration with a total retinal detachment Following surgery two patients recovered 2020 vision the third patient regained only light perception
R610	Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases TIMP and collagenase inhibitory activity were measured in the sputum from nine subjects with chronic bronchitis before and five days after treatment with corticosteroid oral prednisolone 40 mg daily The mean sputum TIMP concentrations for eight of the nine subjects increased from 31 SD 087 microgramsml to 58 19 microgramsml 2p less than 0005 Similarly the mean collagenase inhibitory activity in the sputum of eight of the nine subjects increased from 153 11 Uml to 269 092 Uml 2p less than 005 The TIMP concentrations in sputum exceeded the collagenase inhibitory activity suggesting that a proportion of the TIMP was inactive TIMP inactivity was not due to prior complexing with enzyme since the molecular weight of sputum TIMP 27500 was similar to that described for the purified protein 2800028500 Preliminary studies showed the presence of TIMP in bronchoalveolar lavage samples range of six specimens 045 ngml21 microgramsml median 53 ngml Collagenase inhibitory activity was detected in only two of these six lavage samples suggesting that the TIMP was totally inactive in the other four samples The significance of the metalloproteinaseinhibitor balance in the pathogenesis of chronic lung disease requires further study

R612	A survey of Quebec pharmacists was conducted to determine drug information resources currently available obtain information on pharmacists involvement as drug information providers and determine their perceived drug information needs Responses were obtained from 665 of 3283 registered pharmacists for a response rate of 203 percent Hospital and community pharmacists represented more than 90 percent of the respondents The two reference texts most frequently found in community pharmacists libraries were Compendium of Pharmaceutical Specialties and Goodman and Gilmans The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics the latter being available to only 49 percent of the pharmacists More than 60 percent of the hospital pharmacists had at least 10 of the reference texts listed on our survey instrument The majority of pharmacists were actively involved in a variety of clinical pharmacy services Providing drug information to consumers or health professionals was one of the most common activities Several pharmacists expressed their needs for drug information center DIC support in different drug information categories Information on drug interactions and adverse drug reactions was rated as an important need by 68 and 599 percent of the community pharmacists respectively The institution of a regional DIC may provide the support system needed by the pharmacists of Quebec
R613	In the belief that available information can provide reasonable guidance we review the evidence identifying factors which increase or decrease the risk of developing several gastrointestinal diseases In the absence of controlled studies we review case control and other studies As results from animal studies cannot be readily transferred to humans we interpret them cautiously We recommend appropriate personal behavior to reduce risk when they seem reasonably justified by the evidence
R614	We used immunohistochemistry to evaluate four cytologically malignant cutaneous neoplasms on the face or neck of elderly individuals All four lesions were composed of a dermal proliferation of spindle and pleomorphic giant cells Differential diagnosis included spindle cell carcinoma atypical fibroxanthoma malignant melanoma leiomyosarcoma and angiosarcoma All four neoplasms were strongly immunoreactive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin S100 protein desmin and factorVIIIrelated antigen Focal immunoreactivity for lysozyme andor a1antichymotrypsin was seen in the giant cells of each lesion These results supported the diagnosis of atypical fibroxanthoma in each instance Immunohistochemical staining can provide useful information for distinguishing among malignant cutaneous spindle cell tumors
R615	Anticomplement Immunofluorescence was used for antibody titration against varicellazoster virus VZV in 43 patients with peripheral facial palsy Nine of 31 patients 29 with Bells palsy and eight of 12 patients 75 with RamseyHunt syndrome had anticomplement immunofluorescence antibody titres of greater than or equal to 110 On the other hand none of 14 patients with herpes simplex virus HSV infection and 51 healthy adults showed anticomplement immunofluorescence antibody titres of greater than or equal to 110 The anticomplement immunofluorescence antibody titre in two patients with RamseyHunt syndrome increased later and decreased sooner than the indirect immunofluorescence antibody titre becoming undetectable at 66 and 104 days respectively after onset of the disease There was no cross reaction between antiVZV and antiHSV antibodies in the patients who showed a positive antibody rise for VZV As the acute stage of VZV infection is obscure in the patients with peripheral facial palsy without herpes the screening of anticomplement immunofluorescence antibody to VZV at titres greater than or equal to 110 may be useful for the diagnosis of VZV infection in patients with peripheral facial palsy
R616	The crystal structure of glycogen phosphorylase a complexed with its substrates orthophosphate and maltopentaose has been determined and refined at a resolution of 28 angstroms With oligosaccaride bound at the glycogen storage site the phosphate ion binds at the catalytic site and causes the regulatory and catalytic domains to separate with the loss of stabilizing interactions between them Homotropic cooperativity between the active sites of the allosteric dimer results from rearrangements in isologous contacts between symmetryrelated helices in the subunit interface The conformational changes in the core of the interface are correlated with those observed on covalent activation by phosphorylation at Ser14 phosphorylase ba
R617	The investigators conducted a survey of Balint group activities among family practice residencies in the United States The survey was designed to discover how many programs have Balint groups as well as the groups characteristics leadership and structure Of the 381 family practice residencies surveyed 93 responded Of those 66 offered Balint seminars to 115 different groups Most groups met at weekly intervals for two to three years Most groups were led by family physicians 32 psychologists 25 or social workers 19 Most leaders followed the format of a spontaneous case presentation from memory Support for residents and resolution of professional role conflict were rated as the two major objectives of training The leaders rated an understanding of feelings generated when with patients and an enhanced sense of professional selfworth as the most attainable attitudinal changes
R618	Angiographic and clinical data from 155 patients with carotid cavernous fistulae were retrospectively reviewed to determine angiographic features associated with increased risk of morbidity and mortality These features included presence of a pseudoaneurysm large varix of the cavernous sinus venous drainage to cortical veins and thrombosis of venous outflow pathways distant from the fistula Clinical signs and symptoms that characterized a hazardous carotid cavernous fistula included increased intracranial pressure rapidly progressive proptosis diminished visual acuity hemorrhage and transient ischemic attacks Cortical venous drainage from the carotid cavernous fistula is secondary to occlusion or absence of the normal venous outflow pathways and is associated with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and an increased risk of intraparenchymal hemorrhage Angiographic demonstration of a cavernous sinus varix with extension of the sinus into the subarachnoid space is associated with an increased risk of fatal subarachnoid hemorrhage Identification of these highrisk features provides a basis for making decisions about treatment
R619	Albumin replacement to correct hypoalbuminemia in critically ill patients has been controversial This study was a prospective randomized trial of 25 albumin administration in 40 hypoalbuminemic serum albumin less than 25 gL 25 gdL critically ill patients The treatment group 18 patients received 25 albumin supplementation to achieve and maintain serum albumin levels of 25 gL 25 gdL or greater while the nontreatment group 22 patients received no concentrated albumin There was no clinical benefit from albumin therapy when assessing mortality 39 vs 27 treatment vs control or major complication rate 89 vs 77 of patients There were also no significant differences in length of hospital stay intensive care unit stay ventilator dependence or tolerance of enteral feeding despite significant elevations of albumin in the treatment group The costly use of exogenous albumin as treatment for hypoalbuminemia in this patient population does not appear to be justified
R620	The group I intron from Tetrahymena catalyzes phosphodiester transfer reactions on various RNA substrates A modified RNA substrate with a phosphorothioate group in one stereoisomeric form at the site of reaction was synthesized in order to determine the stereochemical course of an RNAcatalyzed reaction The reaction product was digested with a stereospecific nuclease to determine the configuration of the product phosphorothioate The reaction occurs with inversion of configuration at phosphorus implying an inline pathway for the reaction
R621	In 1980 the French Cooperative Group on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia started a randomized clinical trial in which intermediate prognosis patients stage B received either an indefinite course of chlorambucil 01 mgkgd or 12 cycles of the COP regimen vincristine cyclophosphamide and prednisone We present the results of the third interim analysis based on 291 patients 151 in the chlorambucil group and 140 in the COP group with a mean followup of 53 months at the reference date of June 1 1987 At this date 129 deaths were observed 65 in the chlorambucil group and 64 in the COP group there was no improvement in overall survival with the COP regimen P  44 even after adjusting for both prognostic and imbalanced factors P  24 The 3year and 5year overall survival rates were respectively 69 and 44 in the chlorambucil group as compared with 73 and 43 in the COP group The median survival times were 58 months in the chlorambucil group and 57 months in the COP group Moreover no significant difference was observed between the two treatment groups in terms of either treatment response 9month status time to disease progression to stage C or causes of death
R622	Patients with Parkinsons disease PD have been reported to be unable to modify their movement velocity to adapt to changing environmental demands For example when movement amplitude is varied PD patients usually exhibit a nearly constant peak velocity whereas elderly subjects show an increase of their peak velocity with increased amplitude The experiment examined the ability of PD patients to vary the duration of their movement four different percentages of their maximum under conditions where temporal but not spatial control was emphasised PD patients had longer movement times than control subjects but were able to vary the duration of their movement with comparable temporal accuracy to that of elderly subjects For both groups the agonist EMG activity increased with decreased movement duration For the PD patients the number of agonist bursts increased with increased movement duration
R623	Although there is some evidence that physical activity may decrease blood pressure in young and middleaged women the physical activityblood pressure association in older women has rarely been studied As part of an ongoing communitybased study of chronic disease 641 Caucasian women between the ages of 50 and 89 years had blood pressure measured following the Hypertension Detection and Followup Program protocol They also answered selected Health Interview Survey questions about their leisuretime activity and were classified into categories of light 58 moderate 24 heavy 6 or no physical activity 12 by the estimated metabolic rate required for each activity Women who engaged in any physical activity were significantly younger and thinner than sedentary women and had lower fasting and 2hour postchallenge insulin levels They did not differ in alcohol consumption cigarette use or prevalence of coronary heart disease or diabetes Rates of systolic and diastolic hypertension were significantly lower in women participating in light moderate or heavy physical activity compared with sedentary women Blood pressure levels decreased with each increase in reported activity intensity p less than 0005 for trend with systolic blood pressure approximately 20 mm Hg lower in the heaviest activity group compared with systolic blood pressure in sedentary women Intergroup differences remained statistically significant after adjustment for age and body mass index Although physical activity was associated with lower fasting and 2hour postchallenge insulin levels p less than 001 for trend adjustment for insulin levels did not alter blood pressure differences among activity groupsABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R624	In 22 dogs in which erection was induced by cavernous nerve stimulation we analyzed the intracavernous pressure changes during detumescence without and with acute clamping of the aorta or electrostimulation of the lumbar sympathetic chains Additionally the degree of venous outflow obstruction was assessed by saline perfusion of the cavernous body during aortic occlusion Detumescence had three distinct phases an initial phase exhibiting a small pressure increase a second phase showing a slow pressure decrease and a third phase in which a fast decrease occurred The first phase was abolished by aortic clamping whereas the other phases were not significantly affected Sympathetic stimulation abolished or prevented the second phase Perfusion of the cavernous body during the second phase resulted in a pressure rise to offscale values however when initiated during the terminal phase or in the nonstimulated penis the pressure increase was slight Our study indicates that the arterial flow rate influences the duration of the first phase of detumescence and that venous drainage is completely restored in the third phase Furthermore sympathetic stimulation causes an almost immediate full restoration of venous drainage as cavernous perfusion initiated with an intracavernous pressure about twice as high as without sympathetic stimulation failed to increase pressure to offscale values
R625	The purposes of this study were to describe torquevelocity relationships during concentric eccentric and isometric testing of elbow flexor muscles and to determine testretest reliability of a specific isokinetic testing protocol Thirty healthy women were tested using an isokinetic dynamometer at velocities of 0 degrees 30 degrees 120 degrees and 210 degreessec Reliability was assessed in 20 of the subjects by retesting concentric and eccentric torques at 30 degrees and 120 degreessec after a 30minute rest interval The highest torque from three maximal efforts was considered to be peak torque Mean eccentric peak torque was greater than either isometric or concentric peak torque as isokinetic test velocity increased the differences between concentric and eccentric torques became larger Intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 72 to 83 indicating lack of consistency between test and retest torques Consecutive concentriceccentric testing and lack of mechanical stabilization might have contributed to testretest variability and to the relatively small differences between concentric and eccentric torques Continued study of reliability of isokinetic testing protocols and further investigation of concentriceccentric torquevelocity relationships are advocated
R626	In 1981 the National Cancer Institute undertook Phase II trials of interferon alfa2a in patients with nonHodgkins lymphoma including cutaneous Tcell lymphoma CTCL and chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL A dose of 50 X 106 Um2 three times per week was used initially then adjusted downward as dictated by toxic effects A 54 response rate was achieved among 24 patients with lowgrade nonHodgkins lymphomas and the median duration of response was 8 months Less encouraging results emerged from studies in patients with intermediate or highgrade disease Responses were noted in only two of six patients in the former group and only one of seven in the latter group Results have likewise been disappointing in patients with CLL Of 18 individuals treated only two exhibited brief partial responses In CTCL on the other hand alpha interferon may be the most effective single agent Among 20 patients with advanced disease who had failed previous therapies 45 responded The primary doselimiting toxicity in all these trials has been flulike symptoms particularly fever and fatigue Fever has generally resolved as treatment has been continued but dosage reductions are usually necessary to alleviate fatigue Future studies are likely to focus on the use of alpha interferon in combination with chemotherapeutic agents or other biologic response modifiers such as monoclonal antibodies
R627	Serum proinsulin is disproportionately elevated both in the basal state and after an oral glucose load in noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus NIDDM However there is no detailed information about the effect of glycemic control on this abnormality We investigated the effect of glycemic control by dietary treatment on serum proinsulin level in the basal state and in response to an oral glucose load Ten NIDDM patients 7 men and 3 women aged 1960 yr with mean  SD body mass index of 28  6 kgm2 range 2142 kgm2 and normal renal and liver function were studied Before and after dietary therapy 2530 kcalkg ideal body wt 100g oral glucose tolerance tests were performed Proinsulin was measured with our proinsulinspecific antiserum which recognizes the connecting site of the Bchain of insulin and Cpeptide After dietary treatment fasting plasma glucose decreased from 197  35 to 113  18 mgdl P less than 001 Both serum insulin and proinsulin decreased insulin from 15  8 to 10  4 microUml P less than 02 proinsulin from 31  18 to 13  5 pM P less than 02 and the molar ratio of proinsulin to insulin also tended to decrease from 0321  008 to 024  010 P less than 10 Insulin response to oral glucose increased after dietary treatment whereas proinsulin response did not change resulting in a significant decrease in the molar ratio of the area under the curve of proinsulin to insulin after glucose load from 028  012 to 013  007 P less than 001ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R628	With some exceptions the late asthmatic response and increased airway responsiveness to methacholine or histamine are closely associated Increased responsiveness after an allergen challenge can be reversed or prevented by appropriate antiinflammatory treatment To determine how the inflammatory response contributes to an increase in smooth muscle responsiveness in asthma local hematopoietic processes were examined In support of the mast cell hypothesis scrapings from nasal turbinate mucosa have shown greater numbers of mast cells in patients with allergic rhinitis compared with normal subjects Similarly the number of metachromatic cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid correlates directly with methacholineinduced airway hyperresponsiveness Since nasal polyps appear to result from inflammation of nasal mucosa these tissues were also examined for the possible presence of progenitor cells that favor selective growth of basophilmast cells Since growth factors such as interleukins and cytokines stimulate cell activation they may also contribute to ongoing inflammatory processes Therefore substances that modify the production or actions of locally generated growth factors might be developed for the treatment of chronic inflammation of the nasal and bronchial airways
R629	Gastroesophageal reflux is well documented in scleroderma but the complications of Barretts metaplasia and adenocarcinoma are not well described The records of 75 patients with scleroderma seen over a fouryear period at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania were retrospectively reviewed to determine the prevalence of Barretts metaplasia and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and to identify clinical manometric laboratory or radiographic criteria that might predict the presence of these lesions Twentyfour of these patients underwent endoscopy In this group the prevalence of Barretts metaplasia was 37 percent nine patients and adenocarcinoma was also present in two of these patients The patients with and without Barretts metaplasia were similar in age range 22 to 64 compared with 28 to 79 respectively sex six of nine compared with 12 of 15 female respectively frequency of esophageal motility disorders presence of proximal skin involvement digital ulceration and pulmonary involvement as measured by diffusion capacity Barretts metaplasia was diagnosed on the basis of doublecontrast esophagographic results in only one of eight patients with Barretts metaplasia sostudied Patients with Barretts metaplasia tended to have longer duration of heartburn 90  40 months compared with 11  35 months and dysphagia 39  22 months compared with 7  3 months Patients with Barretts metaplasia also tended to have greater impairment of lower esophageal sphincter pressure either at endexpiration 40  21 compared with 61  18 mm Hg or midrespiration 130  30 compared with 169  25 mm Hg Using chisquare analysis however none of these differences reached statistical significance Discrimination did occur on the basis of the presence of the CREST calcinosis Raynauds phenomenon esophageal manifestations of scleroderma sclerodactyly and telangiectasis variant 55 percent compared with 7 percent p less than 001 a duration of dysphagia of more than five months p less than 003 and midrespiratory lower esophageal sphincter pressure of less than 10 mm Hg p less than 005 It is suggested that Barretts metaplasia of the esophagus occurs in one third of patients with scleroderma clinical manometric laboratory and radiographic features are poor predictors of the presence of Barretts metaplasia patients with CREST syndrome prolonged dysphagia or a very low lower esophageal sphincter pressure may have an increased risk for the development of metaplasia patients with scleroderma and Barretts metaplasia have an increased risk of complications such as stricture or adenocarcinomaABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS
R630	One hundred five patients with peritonitis were randomized to receive either tobramycin sulfate plus clindamycin phosphate or moxalactam alone before surgical intervention Fiftynine patients were evaluable A mean of 31 moxalactam and 35 tobramycinclindamycin pathogens per patient were identified Overall success rate was 85 tobramycinclindamycin 2430 moxalactam 2629 When patients with appendicitis were excluded there was an observed but not statistically significant advantage of moxalactam over tobramycinclindamycin 85 vs 67 There were five deaths tobramycinclindamycin four moxalactam one Other complications included hypoprothrombinemia tobramycinclindamycin five moxalactam five renal dysfunction tobramycinclindamycin three moxalactam one and superinfection tobramycinclindamycin nine moxalactam six More wound infections were noted in the group given tobramycinclindamycin These data suggest that moxalactam is as safe and efficacious as tobramycin plus clindamycin The observed benefits of this agent warrant study in a larger sample to verify advantages of moxalactam over combination therapy
R631	OBJECTIVE This investigation compared the efficacy of the monoamine oxidase inhibitor MAOI tranylcypromine with that of the tricyclic imipramine in the treatment of anergic bipolar depressive illness METHOD A controlled doubleblind comparison was used to study 56 outpatients who met operationalized criteria for anergic bipolar depression Patients with bipolar I and II depression were equally distributed between comparison groups Outcome was measured by the patientrated Beck Depression Inventory and the clinicianrated Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression Raskin Mania and Depression Scales Clinical Global Impression Scale and the Pittsburgh Reversed Vegetative Symptom Scale Twentyeight patients were treated with tranylcypromine and 28 with imipramine Seventythree percent of bipolar depressive patients screened for the study met criteria for anergic depression consistent with previous findings from studies in bipolar illness that stretch back over 100 years RESULTS Tranylcypromine produced statistically significant superior outcome in terms of lower attrition greater symptomatic improvement and higher global response without increased risk of treatmentemergent hypomania or mania CONCLUSIONS The authors propose that the apparently superior efficacy of tranylcypromine in bipolar depression is specifically linked to anergia and reversed neurovegetative symptoms Bipolar I and bipolar II patients had comparable outcomes but bipolar I patients had a significantly greater risk of treatmentemergent mood swings Although the relatively poor showing of imipramine warrants close scrutiny these findings provide further documentation of the utility of MAOIs in patients presenting with anergia motor retardation hyperphagia andor hypersomnia
R632	To answer the question of whether proximity of MultiTest skin test sites causes false positive reactions 50 subjects with prior 4 skin test responses were retested with antigens and ten additional subjects were tested with histamine 18 mgmL No positive readings occurred at any of the replicate saline control sites adjacent to 3 or 4 allergen sites or to 3 histamine reactions
R633	Neurologic outcome of hypoxic ischemic coma after cardiac arrest was studied in 32 patients Observations were made and samples collected 24 and 48 h after the ischemic insult The GlasgowPittsburgh coma score was assessed for its prognostic value Other variables studied were the EEG and adenylate kinase lactate and glutathione in the cerebrospinal fluid CSF Outcome was termed good if the patients resumed an independent life within a 6month followup period The closest correlations between prediction and good outcome occurred with the GlasgowPittsburgh coma score 94 and the EEG 77 at the 48h examination a modified coma score 96 at 48 h and CSF lactate 78 at 24 h Some simple neurologic signs eg no withdrawal response to pain at stated points in time was 100 associated with a bad outcome although their absence was not associated necessarily with a good prognosis
R634	Postterm antenatal fetal surveillance has traditionally begun at 42 completed weeks of gestation However recent data have shown that a significant percentage of cases of perinatal asphyxia occurs between 40 and 42 weeks of gestation We compared the perinatal outcome of fetuses with antenatal surveillance beginning at 41 weeks to those starting at 42 weeks of gestation The study groups consisted of 908 patients who began antenatal testing at 41 weeks and 352 who began testing at 42 weeks Antenatal testing consisted of twiceweekly amniotic fluid assessments and nonstress tests including evaluation for late and variable decelerations Between 41 and 42 weeks the group whose testing started at 41 weeks had an overall incidence of intrapartum fetal distress of 27 no stillbirths and no infants with major neonatal morbidity Patients without antenatal testing who delivered between 41 to 42 weeks did not have a significantly increased incidence of fetal distress 33 p  007 However this group had a significantly increased incidence of adverse outcomes p less than 005 including three stillbirths and seven cases of major neonatal morbidity Beyond 42 weeks the group whose testing started at 41 weeks had a 23 overall incidence of fetal distress This was significantly less p less than 001 than the group whose testing started at 42 weeks 56 Neither of the groups had any stillbirths or infants with major neonatal morbidity These findings suggest that starting antenatal testing at 41 weeks of gestation may result in decreased postterm perinatal mortality and morbidity as well as a decreased incidence of intrapartum fetal distress

R636	betalactamases are enzymes that protect bacteria from the lethal effects of betalactam antibiotics and are therefore of considerable clinical importance The crystal structure of betalactamase from the Grampositive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus PC1 has been determined at 25 angstrom resolution It reveals a molecule of novel topology made up of two closely associated domains The active site is located at the interface between the domains with the key catalytic residue Ser70 at the amino terminus of a buried helix Examination of the disposition of the functionally important residues within the active site depression leads to a model for the binding of a substrate and a functional analogy to the serine proteases The unusual topology of the secondary structure units is relevant to questions concerning the evolutionary relation to the betalactam target enzymes of the bacterial cell wall
R637	The distribution of neuropeptide Y in the ureter of the rat rabbit and man has been determined by radioimmunoassay and chromatographic analysis of the tissue extract The localization of neuropeptide Yimmunoreactivity has been identified by immunocytochemistry A regional distribution of neuropeptide Y was found highest concentrations being present in the ureterovesical junction Throughout the ureter neuropeptide Yimmunoreactive nerve fibers were identified to surround the blood vessels and a few plexuses of neuropeptide Ycontaining nerves were present within the muscle layers Neuropeptide Y was not present within ganglion cells Treatment of rats with 6hydroxydopamine resulted in a significant reduction of neuropeptide Y concentrations in the upper middle and lower thirds of the ureter This depletion in extractable neuropeptide Y was associated with morphologic changes typical of axonal degeneration of the neuropeptide Ycontaining nerve fibers
R638	To contribute to the GeschwindGalaburda theory of cerebral lateralization we examined the relationship of lefthandedness to allergic disorders and stuttering using epidemiological data of two French samples one of which N  9591 is representative of the French male population between 17 and 24 years of age Results showed a higher frequency of stuttering but not of allergic disorders in lefthanders Extreme righthandedness was observed to be significantly associated with a lower frequency of allergic disorders response bias might explain such a relationship Findings were confirmed after allowing for potential confounding factors such as age and education In both samples stuttering and allergic disorders were significantly related
R639	Tubulointerstitial alterations were studied in 18 biopsy cases of systemic vasculitis To evaluate the changes more objectively two indexes the number of interstitial inflammatory cells and tubulitis percentage were used The group means of both of these indexes were statistically higher than those of the autopsy control group while 14 of the cases 778 showed a significant difference P less than 001 between individual means and the control group means On the other hand tubulointerstitial changes in systemic vasculitis seemed to be less prominent than druginduced tubulointerstitial nephritis TIN according to these indexes However comparing these indexes with those of druginduced TIN six cases 333 of systemic angiitis could be regarded as having developed pathologic changes similar to TIN Statistical difference was not shown in the indexes between those patients with histologic evidence of necrotizing angiitis and those without it Clinically urinary NacetylbetaDglucosaminidase NAG was abnormally high in all three examined cases reflecting the damage of renal tubular epithelial cells Not only the vascular and glomerular lesions but also tubulointerstitial changes should be evaluated in the renal biopsy specimen of systemic vasculitis
R640	Immune function in patients with hairy cell leukemia HCL was examined serially during treatment with alternating monthly cycles of recombinant interferon alpha2a and 2deoxycoformycin dCF At presentation most patients had normal numbers of T lymphocytes and their cells had normal proliferative responses to mitogens phytohemagglutinin PHA and concanavalin A Con A and alloantigens Patients had severe monocytopenia decreased delayedtype hypersensitivity DTH reactions and decreased peripheral blood natural killer NK activity Treatment caused a profound decrease in all lymphocyte subpopulations T cells were more affected than B cells or NK cells Numbers of CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes decreased to levels less than 200 cellsmicroliters in all patients during treatment This decrease in T cell number was associated with a marked decrease in proliferative responsiveness to PHA Con A and alloantigens These abnormalities persisted throughout the 14 months of treatment and have continued for up to 6 months beyond discontinuation of treatment NK cell activity increased during treatment but cycled depending on the phase of treatment highest activities were observed after interferon IFNalpha and lower levels of activity were observed after dCF DTH responses generally did not improve during therapy Levels of IgM IgG IgA and IgD did not change during treatment but IgE levels rose in most patients All immunosuppressive effects were attributable to dCF since patients receiving IFNalpha 2a alone did not exhibit these same immunosuppressive effects and patients receiving dCF alone after IFN failure exhibited similar abnormalities Despite this severe immunosuppression from dCF lifethreatening opportunistic infections have not been observed in our patient population Six patients developed localized Herpes zoster infection among 21 patients who had received dCF Pending the results of longterm followup we recommend that dCF be reserved for patients who have failed splenectomy and IFN therapy
R641	The usefulness of a general capacity model for predicting age differences in memory for critical information in text was assessed Passages that either explicitly stated or implied in either a predictable or unpredictable manner a fact central to understanding were read to study participants No age differences were obtained in the recall of explicit central facts but the younger adults outperformed the older adults when these facts had to be inferred A revised capacity model which implicates encoding processes in the breakdown of inference formation is outlined to account for these and other data
R642	This study examines the historical bases of what physicians ought to do as well as what they actually have done with regard to the treatment of diseases such as AIDS which put them at risk for their lives The earliest explicit statement of what ought to be done goes back only to 1847 when the American Medical Association was founded However this statement conflicts with a 75yearold assertion that physicians have a right to choose whom they will serve The conflict is compounded by the suspicion that both stated principles were based at least in part on socioeconomic considerations rather than moral imperatives Of what physicians have actually done over the last 2400 years little more can definitely be said than that many have not tried to escape mortal risk while others have done so Thus it is difficult to employ history as a basis for claiming that physicians have an obligation to treat AIDS
R643	A patient died 5 months after undergoing cardiac transplantation Endomyocardial biopsies performed prior to death showed no evidence of severe rejection At autopsy nonnecrotizing occlusive coronary arteritis was present The intima of the coronary arteries contained numerous lymphocytes and plasma cells Chronic rejection appeared to be responsible for the arteritis The onset of coronary occlusive disease is insidious and recognition depends on the performance of coronary arteriography which is usually not done until the oneyear followup Early coronary arteriography is suggested to rule out occlusive coronary arteritis when cardiac allograft function is not satisfactory even when the endomyocardial biopsy shows no evidence of rejection
R644	A 36yearold patient was investigated for a lifelong history of epistaxis and delayed bleeding after minor surgeries Deficiencies or abnormalities of the coagulation system of platelet function or of factor XIII and alpha2antiplasmin were excluded Consistently however over a period of 7 years a high basal euglobulin fibrinolytic activity was observed that was characterized by a high tissuetype plasminogen activator tPA activity normal tPA antigen and undetectable plasminogen activator inhibitor type1 PAI1 antigen and activity The high specific activity of tPA 640000 IUmg and the minimal amounts of tPAPAI1 complexes detected by fibrin zymography suggest that in this patient all tPA was active This is in striking contrast to normal plasma where the majority of tPA is complexed to PAI1 Thus in this patient a severe deficiency of PAI1 is associated with a delayed type bleeding tendency Our observation underscores the importance of plasma PAI1 for the stabilization of the hemostatic plug
R645	It is often difficult to accurately judge the clinical tumor margins for extramammary Paget disease Mohs micrographic surgery was used to extirpate a tumor which clinically measured 1595 cm2 Following Mohs micrographic surgery it was found that the actual dimensions of the tumor had been underestimated by 97 per cent Since the Mohs micrographic surgeon microscopically examines the entire subcutaneous margin of the resected tumor this technique provides an accurate method of determining the depth of tumor penetration Mohs micrographic surgery allows for maximal conservation of normal tissue and yields higher cure rates than other conventional methods of treatment When approaching tumors of the genitalia which may display poorly defined clinical margins Mohs micrographic surgery should be considered the technique of choice
R646	We report two outbreaks of salmonellosis due to lactosefermenting Salmonella newport in a Halifax nursing home in August 1983 and July 1986 that we believe were related The relative rarity of this serotype and other epidemiologic evidence suggest that the organism was endemic in the institution for at least 3 years Persistent carriers as well as ill and convalescing patients presumably were responsible for propagation of the outbreak We recommend adequate microbiologic followup of infected residents and implementation of surveillance and infection control measures for nursing homes and special care institutions
R647	The case of a 40yearold man with syringobulbomyelia secondary to an unresectable spinal extramedullary tumor is described Fifteen years previously the patient had undergone a laminectomy of T8 through T12 for a benign spinal cord tumor at another hospital and had become paraplegic the tumor neurinoma had been neglected for 12 years Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a large thoracolumbar spinal tumor with syringobulbomyelia Polysomnography showed central peripheral and mixedtype sleep apneas After the failure of an attempted syringoperitoneal shunt cordectomy at the level of T6 was performed with a good result The mechanisms of the formation of syringomyelia and sleep apnea secondary to a caudal spinal extramedullary tumor are discussed
R648	A review of the results of 192 kinematic total knee replacements five to nine years after the operation showed that the results were still satisfactory At the time of the review the ages of the patients ranged from twentytwo to eightyseven years About half of the patients had rheumatoid arthritis and the other half osteoarthrosis About 90 per cent of the results were rated good or excellent and the average range of flexion was 109 degrees Radiolucency was present around 40 per cent of the tibial components 30 per cent of the femoral components and 60 per cent of the patellar components but the lines were thin and not progressive The complications included loosening of the patellar components in five knees one fracture of the tibial tray with loosening of the patellar component one fracture of the patellar component and one dislocation of the patellar component

R650	Avian homologues of mammalian gamma delta and alpha beta TCR termed TCR1 and TCR2 have been identified in the chicken with specific mAb A third TCR dubbed TCR3 has been identified on a subpopulation of T cells that lack the TCR1 or TCR2 epitopes We have now produced a mAb that identifies this TCR3 molecule The antiTCR3 antibody immunoprecipitates a CD3associated heterodimer with a relative Mr of 88000 composed of 48000 and 40000 disulfidelinked chains The Mr 40000 chains of TCR3 and TCR2 exhibited the same isoelectric points of 56 to 65 and had core proteins of 34000 Although the Mr 48000 chain of TCR3 and the Mr 50000 chain of TCR2 had the same basic isoelectric point of 62 to 76 their core proteins were different in size 31000 vs 29000 Immunofluorescence analysis reveals that the TCR3 was present on all of the CD3 T cells not identified by antibodies specific for TCR1 or TCR2 Thymocytes that expressed the surface CD3TCR3 complex at relatively low levels were predominantly CD4 and CD8 whereas those with higher levels of surface CD3TCR3 were predominantly CD4 and CD8 singles Mature TCR3 cells in the periphery were also either CD4 80 or CD8 20 The TCR1 TCR2 and TCR3 subsets of T cells were generated sequentially in the thymus and seeded to the periphery in the same order Intrathymic development of the TCR3 cells was selectively inhibited by embryonic treatment with the antiTCR3 mAb The pattern of histologic localization of TCR3 cells in the periphery was similar to the TCR2 subset of cells except that the TCR3 cells were rarely seen in the intestine Crossreactivity patterns of the antichicken TCR antibodies suggested that other gallinaceous species share the three types of TCR We conclude that TCR2 and TCR3 in gallinaceous birds may represent alpha beta subfamilies of TCR that are sequentially expressed on developmentally discrete sublines of T cells

R652	The effects of fentanyl or cardiovascular function regional distribution of cardiac output and the dose required for producing anesthesia were studied in ten previously catheterized newborn lambs In addition the effects of fentanyl on cerebral blood flow and oxygen utilization were examined Fentanyl in cumulative doses as high as 44 mgkg average plasma levels of 646  95 ngml maximum plasma level of 862 ngml did not reliably produce anesthesia as assessed by tail and foot clamping although it did cause profound respiratory depression With normocapnia maintained by mechanical ventilation fentanyl did not alter cerebral oxygen delivery or consumption and the two remained coupled Fentanyl did not affect cardiac output heart rate or mean arterial blood pressure at the highest dose level nor did it reduce blood flow to specific organ beds other than the kidney Thus the hemodynamic stability seen with fentanyl in the lamb does not occur at the expense of reduced blood flow to organs such as the gastrointestinal tract or brain that are particularly vulnerable in the neonate
R653	The kinetics of morphine morphine6glucuronide M6G and morphine3glucuronide M3G were studied in a 56yearold female with lung cancer Longterm treatment with morphine intrathecally 28 mg every 6 h was used for pain control Cerebrospinal fluid CSF concentrations of morphine were high with an elimination halflife of 21 h The plasmaCSF ratios for M6G and M3G were 108 and 41 respectively suggesting that M6G penetrates the bloodbrain barrier more easily than M3G The low CSF concentrations indicate that M6G played hardly any major analgetic role in the patient studied
R654	Proximal realignment with standard lateral retinacular release Insall operation was performed on 35 knees with a followup time of two to 11 years The results for chondromalacia patellae were satisfactory to excellent results in 20 of 23 knees 87 at two years and in eight of 15 knees 55 at five to 11 years Satisfactory to excellent results in 11 of 12 knees 92 were noted for recurrent patellar dislocation This procedure should be reserved for advanced chondromalacia patellae Grades III and IV and recurrent patellar dislocation Anatomic studies suggest that the pain relief was most likely due to a combination of patellar denervation and restoration of patellar congruence
R655	CGS 16949A is a new nonsteroidal competitive inhibitor of the aromatase enzyme In this Phase I trial 16 heavily pretreated postmenopausal patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with escalating doses of CGS 16949A from 06 to 16 mg total daily oral dose No hematologic biochemical or significant clinical toxicity was encountered Endocrinologic and pharmacologic data were available from 12 of these patients Maximum inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis was observed at a dose of 2 mg CGS 16949A daily At this dose the inhibition of estrogen biosynthesis was equivalent to 1000 mg aminoglutethimide AG The fall in plasma and urinary estrogens without a concomitant drop in androgens confirmed the specific blockade of aromatase activity At doses of 4 to 16 mg daily CGS 16949A appeared to inhibit the C21hydroxylase enzyme as well The t12 of CGS 16949A in the circulation was 105 hours Of 16 evaluable patients there were two partial responses and seven patients with stable disease
R656	Plasma 3Omethyldopa 3OMD concentrations in parkinsonian patients treated with levodopa on a longterm basis reflect daily levodopa dosage and do not vary markedly during the day Oral challenges with 3OMD reduce the clinical response to levodopa infusions but 3OMD is no more potent then phenylalanine in this regard These observations plus the fact that 3OMD makes a small contribution to the total concentration of large neutral amino acids competing with levodopa for transport at the bloodbrain barrier support the contention that 3OMD is not an important determinant of clinical response to levodopa
R657	Determination of preoperative pulmonary function is crucial in avoiding complications from pulmonary resection Many have employed static pulmonary function testing in an attempt to decrease morbidity and mortality from lung resections The purpose of the present study was to correlate preoperative static pulmonary function onesecond forced expiratory volume FEV1 and exercise O2 consumption MVO2 with postoperative morbidity and mortality Fifty consecutive patients underwent preoperative FEV1 and MVO2 determinations A criterion for surgical resection included an FEV1 greater than 17 liters for pneumonectomy greater than 12 liters for lobectomy and greater than 09 liters for wedge resection The surgeon was blinded as to the results of MVO2 studies Mean age was 638 years range 47 to 76 years There were 10 pneumonectomies 28 lobectomies and 12 wedge resections Among the 50 surgical candidates selected solely on the standard FEV1 values mortality was 4 250 and morbidity 12 650 Stratification on the basis of exercise performance showed a 29 mortality 27 and a 43 morbidity 37 in patients with an MVO2 less than 10 mlkgmin Patients with an MVO2 less than 20 but greater than 10 mlkgmin had a 107 morbidity 328 and there were no deaths No patients with an MVO2 greater than 20 mlkgmin sustained any morbidity or died p less than 0001 We conclude that exercise is an important criterion in the preoperative evaluation of patients for pulmonary surgery An MVO2 less than 10 mlkgmin is associated with significant morbidity and mortality
R658	We reviewed the records of 83 patients who underwent 100 orthotopic liver transplantations in order to determine the following 1 the methods to predict blood usage 2 the consequences of an ABOincompatible transplant 3 the benefit of providing cytomegalovirus CMVnegative blood products to CMVnegative patients receiving a liver from a CMVnegative donor 4 the association of donor antihepatitis B core antigens and subsequent hepatitis B and 5 the prognostic consequences of rouleaux observed in pretransplant blood compatibility testing Patient diagnosis the presence of ascites a preoperative prothrombin time greater than 15 seconds and a multifactorial risk category were all predictive of intraoperative blood loss A history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding or an operation that involved the right upper abdominal quadrant was not predictive of intraoperative blood loss Although CMV infection is common after liver transplantation the prophylactic use of CMV antibodynegative blood products in CMVnegative recipients receiving a liver from a CMVnegative donor in our series was not associated with postoperative CMV infection The transplantation of a liver positive for antihepatitis B core antigen was associated with subsequent hepatitis B surface antigen seroconversion in two of four cases Transplantation of an ABOincompatible liver and the presence of rouleaux observed in pretransplant blood compatibility testing were both associated with a significantly higher mortality A careful review of laboratory data and medical records of patients undergoing liver transplantation should enhance the ability to modify the approach to the allocation of limited blood resources and the care and management of these patients
R659	The frequency of murine cytotoxic T lymphocytes CTL capable of responding to HLA antigens expressed on human or murine cells was determined by limiting dilution analysis HLA antigens expressed on human cells stimulated CTL with a precursor frequency of about 1 in 2 X 105 spleen cells in primed mice over two orders of magnitude weaker than a primary allogeneic response There was a 10fold increase in the frequency of precursors responding to HLA antigens when they were expressed on murine cells It was determined that the increased frequency of responders was due to CTL that could only recognize HLA antigens on the syngeneic murine line to which they had been stimulated and that these CTL could not lyse any other HLA expressing murine cells of different H2 haplotypes The lytic activity of these CTL was inhibited by H2bspecific antibodies These results indicate that such CTL recognize HLA antigens in the context of the H2 major histocompatibility complex The magnitude and specificity of CTL responses to xenoantigens are discussed in the context of a model for Tcell interactions with major histocompatibility antigens
R660	Vecuroniums short halflife and minimal cardiopulmonary sideeffects make it a suitable drug for continuous infusion Vecuronium is used frequently in critically ill patients to increase their total compliance and to minimize the adverse effects of mechanical ventilation This crossover prospective study evaluates the use of vecuronium by continuous infusion vs hourly boluses Patients were assigned randomly to either method 12 h later each group was transferred to the other method Neuromuscular blockade NMB was followed with the TrainofFour method Cardiopulmonary variables were followed hourly The total dosagekg body weight was calculated for each method Six patients were started with continuous drip and the other six with hourly boluses There were no significant differences in the cardiopulmonary variables through the two periods although statistically there was a significant difference in the total dosagekg body weight required for each method The mean of total vecuronium used in the drip was 079 mgkg12 h range 01 to 18 The mean of the hourly boluses was 134 mgkg12 h range 10 to 255 Patients on continuous infusion required less vecuronium to maintain a similar NMB p less than 01
R661	Twenty two babies who developed bronchopulmonary dysplasia were compared with 22 babies matched for gestational age who did not Those with bronchopulmonary dysplasia weighed less at birth and had lower energy intakes from day 7 to day 56 Undernutrition before and after birth is a major problem in babies who develop bronchopulmonary dysplasia
R662	With a newly developed monoclonal antiPTHrP antibody 4B3 the immunohistochemical localization of the parathyroid hormonerelated protein PTHrP was studied on the formalinfixed and paraffinembedded sections of normal human tissues and various subtypes of lung cancer Among normal epithelial tissues keratinocytes in squamous epithelia transitional and bronchial epithelia with squamous metaplasia meningoepithelial cells and mammary ductal cells with lactating changes showed positive immunoreactivity Also among endocrine tissues cells in the parathyroid gland pancreatic islets adrenal cortex pituitary gland and testis were sporadically positive for PTHrP These distribution patterns suggested that in a physiologic condition PTHrP was closely related to keratinization and local secretion andor the metabolism of calcium in specifically differentiated tissues In lung cancer however PTHrP was detected in all cases of welldifferentiated and moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and in most cases of small cell carcinoma irrespective of the patients serum calcium level However PTHrP was not detected in two of five cases of poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma and in all cases of adenocarcinoma Consequently it was found that PTHrP was commonly produced by squamous cell carcinomas of the differentiated type and that humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy could be induced when the PTHrP transgressed the homeostatic mechanisms
R663	PURPOSE An increased incidence of thrombosis has been reported in patients with a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time APTT due to a lupus anticoagulant LA which is an antibody to negatively charged phospholipids The antiphospholipid antibodies can be quantitated in an enzymelinked immunoabsorbent assay ELISA that utilizes cardiolipin as the antigen With the development of the ELISA two major areas of controversy have arisen First the correlation between assay results for LA and for the ELISA has varied widely among laboratories Second some investigators have described a correlation between high levels of anticardiolipin antibodies ACA and thrombotic disorders whereas others have found no association between ACA levels and thrombosis in a general population of medical patients To explore these issues further the present study determined the sensitivity and specificity of an LA assay for detecting ACA in medical patients with a prolonged APTT The association between the isotype and titer of ACA and thrombosis was examined in those patients positive for LA PATIENTS AND METHODS Plasma samples from 70 medical patients with a prolonged APTT by routine screening studies were tested for the presence of LA by dilution of phospholipid in an APTT system and for IgM and IgG ACA according to a standardized ELISA Clinical records were reviewed for a history of thrombotic events by an investigator who had no knowledge of the laboratory results RESULTS The ACA assay gave positive results in 47 patients 44 of whom also tested positive for LA Thus the sensitivity for the LA assay for detecting ACA was 94 confidence interval 82 to 99 The result of the LA assay was negative in 20 of 23 patients who were ACAnegative The specificity of the LA assay was 87 confidence interval 67 to 98 Twelve of the 47 patients 26 had a history of venous or arterial thrombosis Of these patients 75 tested in the highpositive range for IgG or IgM ACA or both Of the 35 patients without thrombosis only 14 were in this range Patients with thrombosis had either underlying systemic lupus erythematosus lymphoma or no apparent etiology for LA There was no history of thrombosis in patients with LA associated with infection or medication CONCLUSION A test for LA in medical patients with a prolonged APTT can be sensitive and specific for ACA Determination of ACA levels in patients who have LA that is not induced by medication or infection may define those patients at increased risk for thrombosis
R664	We subjected 10 New Zealand White rabbits to 10 minutes of global cerebral ischemia under either normothermic 37 degrees C or moderately hypothermic 29 degrees C conditions Hippocampal concentrations of glutamate aspartate and glycine were monitored using in vivo microdialysis Outcome was assessed by both neurological and neuropathologic criteria Hypothermia afforded nearly complete protection from ischemic injury Ischemiainduced increases in the concentrations of glutamate aspartate and glycine in the normothermic group 3 12 and 3 times baseline were strikingly attenuated in the hypothermic group In addition the prolonged postischemic elevation of glycine levels seen in the normothermic group was absent in the hypothermic group These results suggest that the neuroprotective properties of hypothermia may reside in part in their ability to prevent increases in the extracellular concentrations of amino acids that enhance the activity of the NmethylDaspartate receptor complex
R665	The effect of extracellular acidosis on contraction of single isolated ventricular cells from rabbit was measured in a system in which pHo could be changed in less than 200 msec The contractile response to acidotic levels was complete within 25 seconds The response was measured 30 seconds after pHo was decreased to 70 65 60 and 55 at each of 8 Cao levels 012540 mM Cell shortening versus Cao was plotted to construct a curve for each pHo level with each point relative to shortening at pH 75 Cao  1 mM 100 value Calcium current 1 mM Cao was also measured 30 seconds after pHo was decreased from 75 to 65 with singlecell patch clamp technique The contractile response to extracellular acidosis is accurately predicted by assuming two probably sarcolemmal sites at which H ions affect calcium binding andor flux equation see text The first factor represents a set of sites that are proposed to control access dependent on the degree of their ionization to sites represented by the second factor The latter sites are proposed to accept calcium according to massaction law The response of calcium channel current to extracellular acidosis was also complete and reversible within 25 seconds The current response indicates that the twosite model could be predictive for the effect of extracellular acidosis on calcium current in ventricular cells
R666	Nippostrongylus brasiliensis infection of the rat resulted at day 10 of infection in decreased levels of jejunal enterocyte sodiumpotassiumactivated adenosine triphosphatase NaKATPase and potassiumactivated pnitrophenyl phosphatase KpNPPase activities Parallel decreases occurred in active sodium efflux from jejunal enterocytes in the presence and absence of actively transported monosaccharides Ileal enterocyte NaKATPase and KpNPPase activities were significantly increased as was active sodium efflux In contrast to controls the presence of monosaccharides produced a stimulation of active sodium efflux from ileal enterocytes derived from infected rats Enzyme and sodium transport changes in the jejunal enterocytes probably reflect cellular immaturity Functional changes in ileal enterocytes probably represent a compensatory phenomenon
R667	Enzymic activities of the respiratory chain and content of immunochemically detectable subunits in NADHubiquinone oxidoreductase Complex I were measured in mitochondria from the skeletal muscles of 4 patients with mitochondrial myopathy encephalopathy lactic acidosis and strokelike episodes MELAS The rotenonesensitive NADHcytochrome c reductase activity was extremely decreased ranging from 0 to 27 of the control value In all patients the content of subunits of Complex I was also reduced in parallel with the rotenonesensitive NADHcytochrome c reductase activity It is suggested that the variation in the degree of deficiency of Complex I subunits could explain the clinical heterogeneity of patients with MELAS
R668	Three mouse monoclonal antibodies mAbs recognizing antigens of human melanocytic cells were used to study a large panel of cultured normal and tumor cells and fresh tissues Two of the monoclonal antibodies designated TA99 and CF21 detect melanosomal antigens whereas mAbC350 recognizes a cell surface antigen Among cultured cells the three mAbs reacted exclusively with normal melanocytes and pigmented melanomas but not with nonpigmented melanomas or cells of other lineage Immunohistochemical assays using mAbTA99 and mAbCF21 on freshfrozen sections from a large panel of normal tissues revealed a characteristic pattern of reactivity restricted to pigmented cells mAbC350 did not react with any normal tissues All nevi and primary melanoma specimens and 93 of metastatic melanomas were reactive with at least one of these three monoclonal antibodies No reactivity was found with 62 nonmelanoma tumors An inverse correlation was observed between TA99 expression and stage of tumor progression These markers are useful for studies of melanocyte differentiation and malignant transformation subsetting of melanocytic lesions and identification of tumors of melanocytic origin
R669	A recombinant plasmid was constructed with six synthetic DNA oligomers such that the DNA sequence corresponding to yeast tRNAPhe is flanked by a T7 promoter and a BstNI restriction site Runoff transcription of the BstNIdigested plasmid with T7 RNA polymerase gives an unmodified tRNA of the expected sequence having correct 5 and 3 termini This tRNAPhe transcript can be specifically aminoacylated by yeast phenylalanyltRNA synthetase and has a Km only 4fold higher than that of the native yeast tRNAPhe The Km is independent of Mg2 concentration whereas the Vmax is very dependent on Mg2 concentration Comparison of the melting profiles of the native and the unmodified tRNAPhe at different Mg2 concentrations suggests that the unmodified tRNAPhe has a less stable tertiary structure Using one additional DNA oligomer a mutant plasmid was constructed having a guanosine to thymidine change at position 20 in the tRNA gene A decrease in VmaxKm by a factor of 14 for aminoacylation of the mutant tRNAPhe transcript is observed
R670	A nationwide study on the impact of shared values on staff nurse job satisfaction and perceived productivity was done in 24 hospitals under different auspices some of which were also Magnet Hospitals Data were obtained from a 25 random sample of the staff nurse population N  2336 58 of the head nurse group 65 of the clinical experts and 66 of the top management Staff nurses and clinical experts had more value congruence than did staff nurses and head nurses A significant inverse correlation was found between value congruence and nurse job satisfaction and quality care Explanations of the finding center on recent role changes for both staff nurses and head nurses power differential and evolving clarity of the staff nurse role A serendipitious finding was that staff nurses reported fewer factors as important to their job satisfaction and perceived environment conducive to quality patient care than did other members of the nursing department However factors important to staff nurses were very important
R671	Seventythree fractures of the femoral shaft seventy patients were randomized to treatment with interlocked nailing with either the BrookerWills femoral nail thirtynine fractures or the RussellTaylor femoral nail thirtyfour fractures Sixtyone patients sixtyfour fractures were prospectively followed from admission until healing of the fracture Specific attention was paid to recording operative details including technical difficulties associated with insertion of the nails Technical difficulties were encountered in insertion of the proximal screw distal screw and nail and in deployment of the fins Insertion of the RussellTaylor nail was associated with less technical difficulty operative time and estimated loss of blood The two nails differ in their biomechanical properties methods of fixation and instrumentation These differences did not affect the clinical outcome the fractures in both groups of patients healed with excellent functional results
R672	Similarities between Alzheimers disease and aluminum toxicity have led to the suggestion that a causal relationship may exist However the two disorders differ in many respects The author reviews the evidence concerning the relationship between aluminum toxicity and Alzheimers disease and answers the question is there a connection
R673	Cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system are the predominant cell producing HIV1 in most tissues including the central nervous system CNS spinal cord lung and skin infection is associated with dementia neuropathy pneumonitis and dermatitis respectively Different HIV1 isolates vary markedly in their ability to infect mononuclear phagocytes productively Here we describe molecular clones of a CNSderived isolate HIV1JRFL which can replicate efficiently in mononuclear phagocytes Analysis by polymerase chain reaction of early events after infection indicates that the early phase of viral replication before reverse transcription determines tropism Genetic mapping of the macrophagetropic phenotype by construction of recombinant viruses indicates that mononuclear phagocyte infectivity can be determined by a 157aminoacid region of the gp 120 glycoprotein of HIV1JRFL Significantly this region is upstream from the previously defined CD4binding domain We propose that at least one determinant for mononuclear phagocyte tropism involves target cell interactions with regions of gp120 distinct from the CD4binding domain
R674	The authors have reviewed the clinical presentation visual fields color vision testing visualevoked potentials and computed tomographic CT findings of 58 patients 95 eyes with dysthyroid optic neuropathy The authors compared these findings to a control group of 60 patients 119 eyes with thyroid eye disease who underwent CT scanning and did not exhibit evidence of optic neuropathy Clinically dysthyroid optic neuropathy is an insidious disease when compared with the usual Graves orbitopathy patient the optic neuropathy group presented at a later age and with a later onset of thyroid eye disease The patients in this group were more likely to be male andor diabetic and often presented with desaturation of color vision Asymmetrical extraocular muscle restriction and vertical tropias were more frequent in the optic neuropathy group The most sensitive indicators of optic nerve dysfunction appeared to be visualevoked potentials and color vision Computed tomographic studies confirmed that apical orbital crowding was a characteristic feature of optic neuropathy These findings should alert the clinician to a more aggressive approach to these patients
R675	Human lymphotropic retroviruses have been identified as the etiological agents of adult Tcell leukemia and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS Human Tlymphotropic virus type I HTLVI has been linked to the etiology of ATL and human immunodeficiency virus type I HIV1 has been identified as the cause of AIDS Both retroviruses are Tcell tropic HTLVI is a transforming virus whereas HIV1 is a cytopathic virus and kills the cells it infects HTLVI has recently been identified from some patients with tropical spastic paraparesis and it appears that HTLVI infection alone or in the presence of other cofactors may be important in the development of this neurological dysfunction
R676	The authors investigated the use of a recently described method for the rapid determination of the lamellar body count LBC as a means of evaluating fetal pulmonary maturity Results of the rapid LBC were compared alone and in combination with the foam stability index FSI with the results obtained by thinlayer chromatography TLC The study used 90 consecutive amniotic fluid specimens from 82 patients Rank ordering of the data suggested cutoff points of 19000microL for the rapid LBC and 46 for the FSI Statistical analysis indicated that the addition of the LBC improved the sensitivity of the FSI P less than 001 by the McNemar test although the reverse was not the case P greater than 01 The linearity and reproducibility of the LBC were considered acceptable
R677	During an 18month period 82 consecutive patients 37 women and 45 men with a mean age of 50 yr range 15 to 74 underwent hemodialysis with 91 polyurethane doublelumen subclavian superior vena cava catheters inserted via the right subclavian vein Upon catheter removal venograms were performed in 53 which revealed thrombosis in 13 Autopsy performed in 13 other patients revealed thrombosis in three Mean catheter duration was 27 days range 1 to 138 Catheter duration was significantly p less than 01 longer in the 16 cases complicated by thrombosis There was no significant difference in the frequency of thrombosis between men and women Two patients developed symptoms of subclavian vein occlusion after the creation of an arteriovenous fistula on the same side as a previous hemodialysis catheter Overall thrombosis was found in 23 and increased with longer catheter duration We recommend phlebography to exclude thrombosis before creating an arteriovenous fistula on the same side as the previous hemodialysis catheter There was no case of clinical discernible pulmonary embolism
R678	Ultraviolet B UVB irradiation of platelet concentrates PCs may prevent the development of posttransfusion HLA alloimmunization As irradiation performed in a blood center or a hospital will probably be associated with a variable postirradiation delay before transfusion the ability to store PCs after UVB irradiation becomes important The effects have been studied of a UVB dose of 10000 mJ per cm2 the dose used in our institution for UVB clinical trials on PCs pooled and stored for up to 96 hours after irradiation Results showed that after 96 hours of storage though there were no changes in pH platelet count white cell count percent discharge of lactate dehydrogenase or betathromboglobulin there were significant decreases in morphology score and osmotic recovery These changes however were not evident after 24 hours of storage Similarly there was a 60percent decrease in immunoreactive membrane glycoprotein GP Ib after 96 hours of storage but these changes were not seen after 48 hours of storage No changes were seen in levels of GPIIbIIIa in either group during the 96 hours of storage On computeranalyzed twodimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis PCs irradiated at 10000 mJ per cm2 and stored for 72 hours had changes in over 50 platelet proteins as compared to those proteins in nonirradiated agematched control PCs It can be concluded that UVB irradiation of PCs at 10000 mJ per cm2 does not lead to significant platelet deterioration after shortterm storage 2448 hours but is likely to be deleterious after longterm 7296 hours storageABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R679	Over a 2month period 40 patients with untreated malignancy were studied for proteinC PRC antithrombinIII ATIII fibrinopeptide A FPA routine hemostatic screens and presence of liver metastases to determine pretreatment changes of hemostasis and relate them to subsequent development of thrombotic or hemorrhagic complications These patients were observed for a mean period of 18 months There were 23 males and 17 females with a median age of 64 years Nine patients had lung carcinoma 8 colon carcinoma 7 lymphoma 5 breast carcinoma 5 head and neck carcinoma 2 acute leukemia 2 prostate carcinoma 1 adenocarcinoma of unknown primary and 1 sarcoma Eight patients had liver metastases PRC was measured by ELISA ATIII by radial immunodiffusion and FPA by RIA Four patients had decreased ATIII 28 had decreased levels of PRC and 39 had elevated levels of FPA All patients with liver metastases had low PRC Albumin levels were lower in patients with low PRC mean 33 gdL v 40 gdL for others Eight patients five with liver metastases developed thrombotic 4 hemorrhagic 3 or both 1 complications Statistically significant associations were found between 1 presence of liver metastases and development of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications P less than 001 2 presence of liver metastases and decreased PRC P  001 and 3 lower albumin levels and decreased PRC P  0001 Our study documents early changes of hemostasis in untreated malignancy We extend previous observations that decreased PRC levels in malignancy may be due to poor synthetic functions of liver Presence of liver metastases was the only factor associated with subsequent development of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications Biochemical markers of hemostatic abnormalities even though encountered frequently at the time of presentation are of little predictive value for development of thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications
R680	Five patients with primary adenocarcinoma of the appendix are reported All patients presented with symptoms resembling those of acute appendicitis or periappendicular abscess In none of them was malignancy suspected prior to operation It is advisable that every patient above 50 years of age presenting with symptoms of appendicitis undergo laparotomy thus enabling a better exploration of the cecal region If an appendiceal mass is present and frozen section shows malignancy a right hemicolectomy should be performed The prognosis of adenocarcinoma of the appendix is dismal as most patients present with an advanced stage of the disease
R681	A prospective study was undertaken to determine the cost effectiveness of the screening ultrasound examination during the annual checkup of persons with spinal cord injury SCI Fiftytwo patients who were otherwise free of illness at the time of examination were questioned for a history of genitourinary GU symptoms and evaluated with a plain film KUB 24hour creatinine clearance determination and renal ultrasound In those 36 patients without histories of GU symptoms renal ultrasound alone discovered no treatable pathology Of the 16 patients with histories of GU symptoms renal ultrasound did show treatable disease in 13 Effectiveness of the annual SCI followup may be maintained in the demonstration of treatable disease by the selective use of renal sonography only in those patients with histories of GU symptoms
R682	Mild brain injury accounts for a substantial proportion of all persons admitted to a hospital for brain trauma yet the amount of information on the epidemiology of this problem is quite sparse Data on mild brain injuries for San Diego County residents injured in 1981 were analyzed for incidence external cause prehospital factors diagnoses alcohol use and inhospital treatment costs More than 80 of all San Diego County residents hospitalized for an acute brain injury had a mild uncomplicated brain injury a rate of 1308 per 100000 per year Three quarters of these had an ER Glasgow Coma Scale of 15 Rates are twice as high for males compared to females with peak occurrence for males at ages 1519 years More than 40 of mild brain injuries are caused by motorvehiclerelated events The most common diagnosis was concussion 80 or other intracranial injury 14 Median length of hospital stay was 23 days and depended on brain injury diagnosis or Glasgow Coma Scale Although less than 30 of those aged 15 years and older were blood tested for alcohol two thirds of those tested had a level of 100 mg or higher Inhospital treatment costs for concussion or other mild intracranial injury for San Diego County residents exceeded six million dollars in 1981
R683	In the management of gastrinoma a variety of preoperative tests for tumor localization are recommended Their value in predicting surgical outcome is not well defined We reviewed the preoperative investigation and operative outcome in 23 patients to assess the predictive value of localization before surgery With results of laparotomy used as reference the efficacy of computed tomography angiography ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging individually and combined for primary and metastatic disease was determined All investigative modalities were poor for the detection of primary gastrinomas with individual sensitivities in the range of 20 to 29 Their combined sensitivity was 53 with a negative predictive value of only 38 The detection of metastatic disease was better with a combined accuracy of 83 At laparotomy tumor was identified in 19 of 23 83 patients In 14 patients with negative preoperative workup primary gastrinoma was found in 10 of 14 71 and resected for longterm cure in three of 14 21 patients In all nine patients with positive preoperative test results tumor was found and was resected for cure in four 44 patients In conclusion preoperative localization of primary gastrinoma is unreliable and a negative workup does not preclude cure Therefore despite the availability of effective palliative antiulcer therapy all patients exclusive of those with multiple endocrine neoplasia type I or metastasis should undergo laparatomy with curative resection in mind
R684	Fluorescence is a feature of elastin and collagen both major compounds of human dermis that are altered by age and photoexposure We studied the intrinsic fluorescence of skin in vivo in 28 human volunteers to determine whether photoaging and chronologic aging of the skin could be evaluated by this noninvasive technique We demonstrate that the excitation of skin autofluorescence by laser ultraviolet radiation yields characteristic tissue fluorescence spectra that are unrelated to age pigmentation or skin thickness The differences in skin autofluorescence appear to be related to photoexposure Thus laserinduced fluorimetry a noninvasive technique may be adaptable as a marker of photoaging
R685	Over a 2year period 20 patients who presented with masses in the parotid gland were evaluated with magnetic resonance MR imaging T1weighted images were obtained on a highresolution thinsection MR imaging system When cysticappearing lesions were found T2weighted images were obtained in order to better characterize the tumor As in other areas of the body MR images of parotid tumors are not usually histologically specific MR findings may be distinctive in rare cases and define the internal architecture of complex parotid masses Although poor tumor margination was a clue to malignancy this was not a consistent finding The real advantage of MR imaging in evaluating parotid masses was its ability to accurately reveal the extraparotid or intraparotid location of a tumor and demonstrate the relationship of the tumor to the facial nerve Small and mediumsized mass lesions could be seen as superficial or deep to the facial nerve Larger masses producing some distortion of the normal course of the nerve made identification of the nerve more difficult if not impossible In malignant tumors with gross invasion of the facial canal MR images can show the extent of nerve involvement
R686	The aim of the present study was to examine in a doubleblind randomised manner the effects of glycopyrronium 0005 mgkg atropine 001 mgkg or a placebo normal saline on the frequency of bradycardia in 92 patients scheduled for major abdominal or gynaecological surgery All patients received fentanyl halothane and vecuronium The frequency of bradycardia in the group that received saline was 18 No cases occurred in either anticholinergic group Mean heart rates intraoperatively were not significantly different between the atropine and glycopyrronium groups It is suggested that the routine use of preoperative anticholinergic agents should be considered when a similar anaesthetic technique is employed
R687	Previous study demonstrated that patients who received total parenteral nutrition TPN with standard intermittent infusion of long chain triglyceride LCT at 013 g kg1hr1 over 10 hr for each of three days showed a significant decline in 99Tcsulfur colloid TSC clearance rate by the reticuloendothelial system RES The present studies evaluated eight patients who received the same total lipid dose of LCT infused continuously as in a threeinone admixture and another nine patients receiving the same amount of fat as a medium chain triglyceride MCTLCT 7525 emulsion intermittently over 10 hr at 013 g kg1hr1 for three consecutive days Patients were given continuous total parenteral nutrition TPN comprised of protein 15 g kg1day1 and dextrose 45 g kg1day1 RES function was examined by measuring the clearance rates of intravenously injected TSC while receiving TPN containing only protein and dextrose and again after three days of fat infusion Mean  SEM clearance rate constants before and after continuous LCT infusion were 038  009 and 041  008 min1 respectively while those before and after intermittent MCTLCT infusion were 050  018 and 073  024 min1 respectively In contrast to intermittent LCT infusion the administration of continuous LCT or an intermittent MCTLCT mixture does not impair TSC clearance by the RES These findings suggest that condensing the daily period of LCT infusion at standard dosage may exceed the rate of metabolic utilization resulting in increased fat removal and diminished TSC uptake by the RESABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R688	We describe a new surgical technique for the treatment of fibrosed interventricular septum with or without left ventricular aneurysm It is designed for patients whose ventriculograms revealed important septal dysfunction Eleven patients ranging from 37 to 66 years of age were operated upon between 1984 and 1988 The left ventricle was opened through the aneurysm or the anterior wall when only anterior septal fibrosis was present In patients with large aneurysms two pursestring sutures were placed on the inside surface of the intact ventricle around its limits for approximation The fibrosed septum was thus excluded from the new ventricular cavity A patch was placed between the fibrosed and the healthy septum reaching to the ventricular wall all around the transitional edge Both ventricular geometry and function were improved All patients were asymptomatic after one year followup
R689	Patch tests with the GEIDC standard series of allergens and with 8 washers made of copper nickel nickelpalladium palladium brass bronze gold and iron were carried out in 964 consecutive patients who complained of intolerance to metals and in 200 controls who did not All subjects were also questioned as to personal and family history of atopy occupational contact and intolerance to gold The results provide support for the substitution of nickel in imitation jewelry with metals such as palladium or bronze
R690	Peritoneal macrophages from mice fed diets containing 10 menhaden oil incorporated significant amounts of n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids n3 PUFA into cellular lipids and this lowered arachidonic acid in these lipid classes compared to those from mice fed diets containing 10 coconut oil The n3 PUFAenriched macrophages secreted significantly smaller amounts of prostaglandin E thromboxane B and 6ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha when stimulated with opsonized zymosan or phorbol myristate acetate These studies demonstrated that menhaden oilenriched diets influence fatty acid composition and prostaglandin synthesis in macrophages
R691	Two types of crystalloids in salivary gland pleomorphic adenomas were studied by light microscopy and electron microscopy The first type of crystalloid the previously described tyrosinerich crystalloid was identified in three 15 of 205 cases The crystalloids by light microscopy assumed a radial configuration resulting in the characteristic petalshaped morphology Transmission electron microscopy revealed them to be electrondense lobular projections without internal structure Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated a range of morphology from rounded and intact doughnutlike structures to aggregates of irregular loosely cohesive plates The crystalloids were backscatter positive by backscattered electron imaging and by xray microanalysis exhibited prominent calcium phosphorus and magnesium peaks that were not present in the adjacent tumor tissue these three elements may be important in the formation and structure of tyrosinerich crystalloids The second type of crystalloid was intraductal and birefringent and was identified in 26 127 of 205 cases In 21 of these 26 cases the crystalloids were lost on 10 formaldehyde fixation and paraffin embedding Histochemical stains and xray microanalysis did not reveal a definite chemical composition but did suggest a predominantly organic nature
R692	Whole cell clamp experiments were used to study the mechanism of action of amiloride on cardiac Ttype Ca channels in guinea pig ventricular myocytes Two hundred fifty microM amiloride blocked the Ttype Ca channel for approximately 50 whereas this concentration did not suppress the Ltype Ca channel The Kd value for the block of the Ttype Ca channel was 233 microM and the Hill coefficient was 11 The drug showed a rapid onset of action and a quick wash out with complete reversibility Amiloride blocked the Ttype Ca channel without frequencydependency ie block was established at the holding potential 90 mV without being dependent on activation and inactivation of the channel Amiloride reduced the amplitude of the Ttype Ca current at all potentials without changing steadystate activation and inactivation Amiloride did not affect the Ttype Ca current when the drug was applied intracellularly via the pipette solution In summary amiloride blocked the Ttype Ca channel in a channel state and voltageindependent way
R693	We evaluated the safety and efficacy of a highly supplemented controlled lowenergy 1764 kJ 420 kcal diet in the treatment of noninsulindependent diabetes and obesity Six obese diabetic women ranging from 143 to 297 of ideal body weight were studied in a metabolic ward for 48 days The subjects ingested a weightmaintenance diet during an eightday control period followed by 40 days of an experimental diet containing 1764 kJ 420 kcal of a mixture of protein 43 of energy intake carbohydrates 51 and fat 6 supplemented with minerals trace elements and vitamins The subjects were monitored for balances of nitrogen and minerals as well as for the appearance of cardiac arrhythmias by 24hour electrocardiographic recordings Weight loss was rapid and sustained and averaged 101  08 over 40 days Fasting plasma glucose levels declined from 162  19 mmolL 293  36 mgdL to 69  08 mmolL 126  16 mgdL by day 35 Similarly hemoglobin A1c levels fell from 011  0009 112  09 to 08  0001 82  11 Urinary Cpeptide levels declined from 622  156 nmol48 h to 200  59 nmol48 h by days 39 to 40 and paralleled the decline in plasma glucose values the majority of which occurred in the first seven days Concentrations of serum cholesterol and triglycerides decreased Balances for nitrogen potassium and magnesium were negative at 17 g24 h 22 mEq24 h and 29 mgdL respectively Blood pressure decreased without orthostasis Resting metabolic rate fell a mean of 18 but remained within normal limits Triiodothyronine levels also declined Twentyfourhour ambulatory electrocardiographic readings disclosed no significant bradyarrhythmia or tachyarrhythmia for any patient These studies based on a limited number of subjects demonstrate that a highly supplemented controlled lowenergy diet is a safe and efficacious treatment for diabetes and obesity leading to significant decreases in weight blood pressure and levels of plasma glucose and plasma lipids Such diets may be the optimal initial treatment of moderate to markedly obese patients with noninsulindependent diabetes
R694	Lower lid stability can be affected by many conditions involving the lid directly eg facial palsy facial clefts trauma or tumors Secondary stretching due to a poorly fitting orbital prosthesis can have the same effect In 41 such eyelids stability was obtained by inserting a large cartilage graft sutured to the tarsal plate and the infraorbital rim Thirteen patients had tarsoconjunctival wedge resections and 10 had lateral canthopexies performed at the same procedure One graft was too small and was later replaced There was one hematoma which was evacuated There were no other lid or visual problems The followup is short 21 months maximum but so far the results are very satisfactory
R695	Acquired progressive lymphangioma is rare and can histologically mimic welldifferentiated angioendothelioma In a 9yearold boy with acquired progressive lymphangioma we demonstrated that the neoplasm consists of at least a vascular component and a smooth muscle component The presence of type IV collagen around many vascular channels suggests that an intermediate stage of differentiation between blood vessels and lymphatics may be present Our findings indicate that acquired progressive lymphangioma is most likely a complex hamartoma composed of vascular channels and smooth muscle
R696	We report the results of a study examining the level of advertisement recognition and tobacco experimentation in a group of US high school students Students who smoked as few as one cigarette per week were found to identify a preferred cigarette brand One brand of cigarettes accounted for 76 of all preferred brands A doseresponse relationship was found between smoking level and cigarette advertisement recognition with regular smokers recognizing 616 of advertisements compared with only 332 for nonsmokers These data have potential implications for youth smoking prevention programs Future research is needed to explain this association and to establish whether cigarette advertising and adolescent smoking are causally related
R697	Fifteen patients with spondylolysis have received compression screw and bone graft treatment for repair of this defect In all but one case solid fusion of the pars defect was achieved within six months after surgery After one year 13 of the 15 patients were able to participate fully in sports activities
R698	One hundred six patients with histologically proven bronchogenic carcinoma were tested for carcinoembryonic antigen CEA tissue polypeptide antigen TPA and carbohydrate antigenic determinant 199 CA199 A total of 349 CEAs 350 TPAs and 317 CA199s were measured In addition sera were assayed from 57 patients with pulmonary benign diseases and their CEA TPA and CA199 levels were used as negative controls for specificity and accuracy One hundred twenty healthy subjects provided our normal CA199 reference value Sensitivity specificity and accuracy were obtained for CEA TPA and CA199 respectively Significant intermarker correlations were found both at diagnosis and during followup CEA and CA199 being the most closely related substances The percentage of patients with elevated levels of TPA increased significantly according to tumor load Individual values of TPA related significantly to the stage of disease Concentrations of CEA TPA and CA199 varied significantly during the course of the illness in relation to treatment response however TPA showed the closest relationship to the clinical status assessments of the followup period Abnormal pretreatment levels of TPA were significantly associated with a poor outcome Biomarker combinations were clinically evaluated by calculating the mean of the percentage of the reference value for each combined marker Using this method any association of TPA with CEA andor CA199 revealed neither a greater diagnostic accuracy nor a more reliable predictive capacity for the above clinical variables than TPA evaluated on its own The authors believe that a single TPA assay should be added to the initial and subsequent clinical assessments of patients with bronchogenic carcinoma
R699	The ultrastructure of the glomerular basement membrane in Alports syndrome is well known and characteristic of this disease but the anterior lenticonus that frequently occurs in this syndrome has not been similarly studied An anterior lens capsule from a 30yearold patient with lenticonus who had Alports syndrome was obtained at capsulectomy and found to be one third the normal thickness centrally and to be more fibrillar than usual There were large numbers of partial capsular dehiscences containing fibrillar material and vacuoles Cellular debris and more recent ruptures of lens epithelial cell membranes underlaid the breaks The anterior capsule is clearly fragile in this disease forming the basis for the progressive lenticonus and anterior polar cataract These abnormalities correlate well with a defect in the type IV collagen molecule as has been recently reported in Alports syndrome
R700	Thirtyfour patients with urinarycolonic diversions have been followed up for 13 to 41 years mean 203 The commonest longterm complication was hyperchloraemic acidosis 50 The most serious was neoplasm at the anastomotic site benign lesions occurred in three patients and carcinomas in two 15 Staining for sialomucins in colonic biopsies adjacent to the anastomoses was positive in 17 of 19 patients It has been suggested that this represents a premalignant change Analysis of faecal flora in 17 diverted patients and 27 controls revealed a significant difference in the carriage rate and viable count of Peptostreptococcus species This finding has not been reported previously and the species could have a role in the aetiology of the neoplasms
R701	Recent evidence suggests that the neurotransmitter gammaaminobutyric acid GABA plays an important role in the control of gonadotropin secretion The present study was conducted to identify the effect and site of action of different GABAergic drugs on LH secretion in vivo and to characterize the precise roles of different GABA receptors in these actions Three different GABAergic drugs were used muscimol and baclofen which act at the level of the GABA A and GABA Breceptors respectively and aminooxyacetic acid AOAA which increases the GABA content in the brain The effects of these drugs were investigated in situations of enhanced LH secretion due to administration of naloxone or LHRH In an initial experiment adult male rats were treated ip with AOAA followed by naloxone AOAA treatment decreased basal LH levels and prevented naloxonestimulated LH release PRL levels were decreased by either AOAA or naloxone however the combination of these two drugs did not induce an additional or synergistic effect on the decreased PRL levels In subsequent experiments freely moving rats bearing Silastic cannulae in the right jugular vein received AOAA muscimol or baclofen a few minutes before either naloxone or LHRH administration Baclofen and AOAA completely suppressed the naloxonestimulated LH increase Muscimol did not prevent the effect of naloxone None of the three GABAergic drugs affected LH release in rats receiving LHRH The results of these in vivo experiments suggest that the GABAergic system exerts primarily an inhibitory effect on gonadotropin secretion which is mediated at a central level since pituitary responsiveness to LHRH is not affected by GABAergic drug treatment GABA Breceptors are responsible for the inhibitory action of GABA
R702	The human thymus leukemialike antigens CD1ac consist of three similar glycoproteins found on subpopulations of normal thymocytes T cell acute leukemias and cutaneous dendritic cells The CD1c antigen recognized by the M241 monoclonal antibody was detected on the circulating mononuclear cells of three children with severe combined immunodeficiency disease SCID Twocolor immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that M241 expression 43 to 95 was limited to cells expressing the B cellrestricted antigens B4 CD19 B1 CD20 and surface immunoglobulin To confirm M241 expression on normal cells of the B lineage rather than aberrant expression limited to SCID B cells its expression was demonstrated serologically and biochemically on purified B cells from spleen tonsil and peripheral blood Parallel analyses with monoclonal antibodies NA134 and 4A76 demonstrated that the CD1a and CD1b molecules were negative on all B cells that were studied It has been hypothesized that the CD1 molecules represent the human counterpart of the murine thymus leukemia antigens due to their similar size limited tissue distribution and association with beta 2microglobulin This study suggests that a subset of CD1 antigens detected by M241 CD1c may represent a human analog of a murine Qa antigen due to its extended distribution on normal peripheral B cells
R703	Determination of the cell types proliferating in the dermis of patients with psoriasis should identify those cells experiencing activation or responding to growth factors in the psoriatic dermal milieu Toward that end sections of formalinfixed biopsies obtained from 3Hdeoxyuridine 3HdUinjected skin of eight psoriatic patients were immunostained followed by autoradiography Proliferating dermal cells exhibit silver grains from tritium emissions The identity of the proliferating cells could then be determined by simultaneous visualization with antibodies specific for various cell types UCHL1 CD45RO T cells recall antigenreactive helper Tcell subset constituted 366  31 mean  SEM n  6 of the proliferating dermal cells in involved skin whereas Leu 18 CD45RA T cells recall antigen naive Tcell subsets comprised only 87  15 n  6 The Factor XIIIa dermal perivascular dendritic cell subset 249  15 of proliferating dermal cells n  6 and Factor VIII endothelial cells 230  23 n  6 represented the two other major proliferating populations in lesional psoriatic dermis Differentiated tissue macrophages identified by phase microscopy as melanophages or by immunostaining with antibodies to Leu M1 CD15 or myeloid histiocyte antigen comprised less than 5 of the proliferating population in either skin type In addition to calculating the relative proportions of these cells to each other as percent we also determined the density of cells in cellsmm2 of tissue The density of proliferating cells within these populations was increased in involved versus uninvolved skin UCHL1 90  17 cellsmm2 versus 18  06 cellsmm2 p less than 001 Factor XIIIa 60  07 cellsmm2 versus 15  05 cellsmm2 p less than 001 Factor VIII 55  14 cellsmm2 versus 00 cellsmm2 p less than 005 The presence of preferential active proliferation of a Tcell subset in lesional dermis suggests that activating signals specific for this subset are contained within the psoriatic dermis in vivo The activation of recall antigenreactive T cells may be a driving force behind the dendritic cell and endothelial cell proliferation Alternatively the selective proliferation and expansion of these two constitutive cell types Factor XIIIa and Factor VIII may result in signals that promote activation of UCHL1 CD45RO T cells
R704	Eight patients underwent carbon dioxide CO2 laser blepharoplasty The temperature of the upper eyelid conjunctiva was monitored and recorded during laser surgery A minimal increase in temperature was noted This study confirms the absence of thermal injury at a distal site from the laser application and the safety of the laser procedure
R705	The effect of heart rate on cardiac output in the fetal heart is controversial We used Doppler echocardiography to investigate the effects of increasing heart rate on stroke volume and ventricular output in the normal human fetal heart Heart rate was increased in 25 human fetuses mean age 36 weeks by auditory stimulation with a sound emitter placed on the mothers abdomen Aortic or pulmonary diameters were measured at valve level from twodimensional echocardiographic images and crosssectional areas were calculated Blood flow velocity spectra from the pulmonary artery or aorta were digitized to obtain flow velocity integrals before and after auditory stimulation Stroke volume was calculated as the product of the flow velocity integral and the area of the great vessel Prestimulation mean heart rate was 132  8 beatsmin and increased after auditory stimulation to 158  9 beatsmin p less than 001 Stroke volume decreased with the increase in heart rate from 37  14 ml before stimulation to 30  11 ml after stimulation p less than 001 but ventricular output calculated as the product of stroke volume and heart rate remained unchanged 048  018 litermin before vs 048  017 litermin after stimulation The decrease in stroke volume was accompanied by a decrease in ventricular enddiastolic area although there was no change either in endsystolic area or fractional change in area This study demonstrates that increases in heart rate within the physiologic range in the normal human fetus result in a decrease in ventricular size and stroke volume but no change in ventricular output or ventricular shortening
R706	Fortytwo patients were treated surgically for ankle injuries including complete disruption or incompetency of the deltoid ligament without any surgical repair as part of the initial operation In a retrospective study 36 patients were followed for one year or longer The functional results appeared satisfactory provided surgical reductions of the medial joint space and lateral malleolus were accurate and maintained until bone repair was complete No evidence of ligamentous instability of the foot or ankle was noted
R707	Pituitary function was investigated in 9 patients in shock after Russells viper bites and in 24 individuals who had been severely envenomed 2 weeks to 24 years previously 3 out of 9 patients had hypoglycaemia and inappropriately low serum cortisol plasma growth hormone and plasma prolactin concentrations 4 who died had pituitary haemorrhage and 1 had adrenal haemorrhage as well Of the 24 who had apparently recovered from bites 7 had clinical features of hypopituitarism and no response in plasma growth hormone or prolactin concentrations to symptomproducing insulininduced hypoglycaemia 4 of these 7 had a sluggish serum cortisol response to Synacthen Depot and 5 had an abnormal cortisol response to hypoglycaemia 4 men with symptoms who were tested had low serum testosterone concentrations serum thyroxine was also low in these men but not in 2 women with menstrual disturbances and impaired insulin responses Of the 17 individuals without clinical evidence of endocrine disease 4 had pituitary hormonal abnormalities Russells viper envenoming may thus produce a disorder resembling Sheehans syndrome
R708	The importance of stereotactic aspiration to the successful management of three cases of brain stem abscess is discussed with special reference to the advantages offered over medical treatment alone Stereotactic aspiration allows evacuation of pus accurate bacteriological diagnosis selection of an optimal antibiotic regimen and instillation of antibiotics directly into the abscess cavity In two of the three cases described here the abscess reaccumulated after initial aspiration despite appropriate maximal medical therapy A repeat aspiration was required before resolution occurred We conclude that medical management alone is not adequate for some cases of brain stem abscess There was no morbidity that could be attributed to the procedure suggesting that the risk of stereotactic aspiration is probably quite low and is likely to be less than the risk of incorrect diagnosis suboptimal choice of antibiotics or progression of the lesion despite appropriate maximal medical therapy
R709	We present a unique case of intra and extraperitoneal epitheloid hemangioma which was mistaken for diffused carcinomatosis representing a clinicalpathological problem and emphasizing the unpredictable behaviour of this tumour We are dealing with epitheloid vascular tumours and briefly touch on the differential diagnosis the principle of biological pathological and clinical behaviour Knowledge of this entity would provide an accurate diagnosis and would hence improve dealing with the problem The conclusion is that this group of Histiocytoidepitheloid vascular lesions have varying biological potential and this unusual functional state represents a large spectrum of cells from normal to neoplastic endothelium
R710	The cause of uveal melanoma is unknown In a few cases however factors are found in association with the disease which may play some part in the aetiology One such factor is inheritance Twelve families have been reported with adequate documentation during the last century in which two or more members have had uveal melanomas At least some of these may be the result of an inherited disorder On available data inheritance is most likely autosomal dominant with partial expressivity or incomplete penetrance This report describes two more families each of which have two members with uveal melanomas
R711	An attempt to reposition an Integra PTCA balloononawire failed although the whole stenosed segment could be crossed before inflation After careful removal the device showed a grossly altered shape Deflated balloon profiles quite different from the initial shape can determine the outcome both in dissections and in multilesion cases
R712	Intracavernous injections and vacuum constrictor devices have been used for the nonoperative management of impotence and sexual dysfunction Although most men are able to use these methods successfully it currently is well known that up to 30 to 35 per cent of the patients may have only a partial response to the injections We observed 22 men with partial tumescence after an intracavernous injection of papaverine 15 to 30 mg and phentolamine 05 to 10 mg The penis was not rigid and the buckling pressures never exceeded 50 mm Hg after 20 minutes of observation In each case we immediately applied a vacuum constrictor device because these devices had been used successfully by other men with similar diagnoses A total of 21 men responded within 30 to 60 seconds and achieved a rigid erection with buckling pressures of greater than 100 mm Hg 16 and 60 mm Hg 5 These findings indicate that a vacuum constrictor device may be used to augment a partial response to an intracavernous injection and that the availability of injections and vacuum constrictor devices provides these men with a more complete nonoperative program
R713	Different molecular species of interleukin 1 IL 1 were examined for the spectrum of responses elicited in human endothelial cells HEC including synthesis of prostacyclin PGI2 tissuetype procoagulant activity PCA platelet activating factor PAF and plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI The IL 1 preparations utilized for the present study included a natural partially purified IL 1 a preparation purified to homogeneity with extensive homology with the derived aminoacid IL 1 beta pI7 sequence denominated 22K factor murine recombinant IL 1 alpha human recombinant IL 1 alpha pI5 and beta pI7 Natural partially purified IL 1 a mixture of alpha and beta species induced the entire spectrum of responses in HEC Production of PAI was elicited by all forms of IL 1 tested PGI2 and PCA were elicited by 22K factor and by human recombinant IL 1 beta and alpha but not by murine recombinant IL 1 alpha PAF synthesis was stimulated by murine and human recombinant IL 1 alpha but not by human recombinant IL 1 beta and 22K factor Thus the available different molecular forms of IL 1 elicit largely but not completely overlapping patterns of responses in HEC The IL 1 pathway of regulation of HEC functions might provide a basis for novel strategies in therapeutically oriented research on vessel wall disorders
R714	Between September 1986 and December 1988 125 patients with osteosarcoma of the extremities entered the second neoadjuvant study at the authors institution Patients received preoperatively two cycles of methotrexate MTX intravenously followed by cisplatinum CDP intraarterially plus adriamycin ADM intravenously After surgery the patients classified as good responders more than 90 tumor necrosis received ADM MTX and CDP while the poor responders less than 90 tumor necrosis had a longer chemotherapy that included ifosfamide and etoposide VP16 in addition to MTX ADM and CDP Limb salvage was possible in 85 of patients 8 had an amputation and 7 had a rotationplasty The surgical margins were adequate radical or wide in 88 of cases and inadequate marginal or intralesional in 12 At an average followup period of 28 months range 13 to 41 109 patients 87 remained continuously disease free 15 12 relapsed with pulmonary metastases and one patient 08 had a local recurrence Compared with the first neoadjuvant study at the authors institution that used only MTX and CDP preoperatively the percentage of limb salvages good responders and continuously diseasefree survival at two years was significantly higher in the second Rizzoli neoadjuvant study 85 74 and 87 versus 77 52 and 59 Systemic toxicity because of chemotherapy was superimposable A retrospective analysis of the real dose intensity for each patient demonstrated a correlation between the intensity of chemotherapy and prognosis
R715	The authors assessed the impact of the Nazi Holocaust on the course and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD among Israeli combat stress reaction casualties They examined a sample of 96 such casualties of the 1982 Lebanon War whose parents had gone through the Nazi Holocaust and compared them to casualties who did not have such family history for 3 consecutive years beginning 1 year after their participation in the war Results showed that 2 and 3 years after their participation in the 1982 Lebanon War the children of Holocaust survivors ie secondgeneration casualties had higher rates of PTSD than did the control subjects as well as a somewhat different clinical picture Clinical and methodological implications of the findings are discussed
R716	The incidence and severity of osteopenic bone disease in primary sclerosing cholangitis is poorly defined Clinical biochemical and radiographic assessment and bone mineral density measurements of the lumbar spine were carried out in two groups of patients Group 1 consisted of 30 patients with advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis group 2 consisted of 18 patients with newly diagnosed primary sclerosing cholangitis Only one patient had bone pain All patients were normocalcemic two had elevated serum parathormone levels Fourteen patients 47 from group 1 but no patients from group 2 had low serum 25hydroxyvitamin D levels Mean bone mineral density was significantly reduced in group 1 patients 097  004 gmcm2 compared with agematched and sexmatched controls 125  001 gmcm2 p less than 00001 and in 15 patients 50 bone mineral density was below the fracture threshold 098 gmcm2 The bone mineral density in group 2 was not significantly different from controls and no patient was below the fracture threshold In neither group did bone mineral density correlate with serum bilirubin 25hydroxyvitamin D fecal fat excretion previous drug therapy or the presence of chronic ulcerative colitis Histomorphometrical examination of bone from four group 1 patients showed increased bone resorption reduced bone formation moderatetosevere osteopenia and no osteomalacia In conclusion severe osteopenic bone disease is common in advanced primary sclerosing cholangitis and like that seen in other cholestatis diseases is consistent with osteoporosis
R717	The development of antiNlike antibodies has been demonstrated with formaldehyde reuse of hemodialyzers It has been recommended to pursue a postrinsing venous effluent formaldehyde concentration in the range of or below 2 to 10 ppm in order to prevent the development of these antiNlike antibodies In the present study we evaluated formaldehyde reuse in a population of 50 patients and whether the strict control of predialysis effluent formaldehyde concentration below 2 to 3 ppm could prevent the development of antiNlike antibodies Five of 50 patients 10 became positive 6 to 14 months after the start of formaldehyde reuse indicating that even a careful control of effluent formaldehyde concentration cannot prevent the occurrence of this abnormality
R718	A dopamine receptor antagonist metoclopramide has unique properties of increasing lower esophageal sphincter pressure and increasing the rate of gastric emptying These gastrointestinal motility actions are useful in the treatment of diabetic gastroparesis and severe gastroesophageal reflux and in postoperative situations involving visceral atony Metoclopramide is a useful adjunctive drug for intestinal intubation and radiologic examination It has also been used intravenously to control the nausea and vomiting of intensive cancer chemotherapy such as with cisplatin Metoclopramide is a powerful antiemetic because of its combined actions on the chemoreceptor trigger zone and intestinal motility This agent is generally not intended for longterm use The oral preparations are recommended for four to 12 weeks of therapy Use of parenteral metoclopramide should be limited to one or two days The most common adverse reactions are restlessness drowsiness fatigue and lassitude Extrapyramidal symptoms occur rarely and only with high dosage or prolonged use
R719	We describe a woman who suffered for several years from joint pain with subsequent development of arthritis of her left knee Because of these symptoms she was subjected to repeated studies including arthroscopy and menisectomy IgG antibodies to Borrelia determined by ELISA were reported to be present and showed an increase of IgG titer to 11024 Histology from the last synovial biopsy disclosed only evidence of a nonspecific synovitis and marked inflammatory infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells Borrelialike structures were detected electron microscopically on semithin Epon sections from the lumen of the strongly infiltrated blood capillary In our case the detection of Borrelia indicated the basis for increase of antibodies against Borreliae It established the correct diagnosis and led to specific therapy of the disease after several years of unsuccessful attempts to control it
R720	In 33 total knee arthroplasties TKAs using instrumentation designed to cut the tibia with 0 degree posterior slope ten tibial components demonstrated at least 2 mm of tibial component subsidence These subsided components were implanted onto tibiae with an average of 8 degrees  2 degrees difference between the preoperative anatomic posterior slope and their postoperative posterior slope The remaining 23 components without subsidence were implanted onto tibiae cut within 2 degrees  2 degrees of their anatomic slope To help understand these clinical observations a laboratory study was performed to compare the load carrying capacity and the stiffness of tibial subchondral bone following two types of tibial cuts one made perpendicular to the long axis of the tibia and the other made parallel to the articular surface of the tibia Mock tibial baseplates mounted on paired cadaver tibiae were loaded in compression and force displacement curves were recorded Tibiae cut parallel to the surface exhibited 40 greater load carrying capacity and 70 greater stiffness than the paired tibiae cut perpendicular to the long axis The biomechanical data of this study indicated that cutting the tibia perpendicular to the long axis results in weaker bone that may be inadequate to support a tibial component This may explain the higher incidence of clinical subsidence if the tibial cut is not made approximately parallel to the anatomic slope
R721	Acute psychosis is a true emergency and is a manifestation of multiple organic and functional disorders The emergency medicine physicians role in dealing with the acutely psychotic patient is to control the patients behavior to delineate the etiology of the psychosis and to provide appropriate initial treatment and disposition When making initial contact with the psychotic patient behavioral control can be accomplished through supportive physical or pharmacologic interventions Judicious use of rapid tranquilization permits rapid control of these patients when supportive and other nonpharmacologic therapies fail Initial examination is directed at identifying immediate lifethreatening organic disorders and promptly treating them Historical data mental status examination physical examination and appropriate radiologic and laboratory investigations give information that assist in delineating functional from organic psychosis Most acute organic psychoses with the exception of some drug intoxications that clear in the Emergency Department require medical or surgical admission Acute functional psychotic patients who are a danger to themselves or others who are without a reliable social support system or who present with their first psychotic episode require admission to the psychiatric service for further evaluation and treatment
R722	If eukaryotic genes could protect bacteria with defects in DNA repair this effect could be exploited for the isolation of eukaryotic DNA repair genes We have thus cloned a DNA repair gene from Saccharomyces cerevisiae that directs the synthesis of a DNA glycosylase that specifically releases 3methyladenine from alkylated DNA and in so doing protects alkylationsensitive Escherichia coli from killing by methylating agents The cloned yeast gene was then used to generate a mutant strain of S cerevisiae that carries a defect in the glycosylase gene and is extremely sensitive to DNA methylation This approach may allow the isolation of a large number of eukaryotic DNA repair genes
R723	Multiple factors including the widespread use of antibiotics the spread of bacterial resistance plasmids and transposons and the increased use of invasive procedures in traumatized or immunocompromised patients have abetted the emergence of constant changes in the nosocomial microflora with selection for highly resistant and virulent bacteria The introduction of new technologies including enhanced life support techniques ranging from blood products to parenteral nutrient supplementation also afford opportunities for previously nonpathogenic organisms to take advantage of new niches Changes in the inanimate environment such as ventilatory systems and changes in personnel and infection control protocols for example disinfectants may also alter the resident nosocomial flora The resultant challenges to clinicians are to be aware of changes in the prevalence of different organisms and susceptibility patterns in the local hospital and community and to be knowledgeable about new antimicrobial agents that have activity against multiply resistant pathogens Judicious antibiotic use and careful application of hospital infection control measures are likely to be effective in meeting these challenges Ongoing clinical and molecular epidemiological studies are required to better anticipate the emergency and spread of new distinctive nosocomial pathogens
R724	Twentyfive patients received either methohexitone 10 mg kg1 or propofol 13 mg kg1 to induce anaesthesia during two separate electroconvulsive therapy ECT treatments A forearm was isolated before administration of suxamethonium 05 mg kg1 so that unmodified seizure duration could be measured Bifrontotemporal electrodes were applied to administer a standard 3s ECT shock Median quartile deviation duration of seizure was reduced significantly after propofol 190 90 s compared with after methohexitone 330 78 s Therefore propofol may not be an appropriate anaesthetic for ECT because of its adverse effect on seizure duration
R725	Drug delivery to the central nervous system CNS is of vital concern to the therapy for primary CNS disorders and the development of drug neurotoxicity The factors influencing drug entry into the CSF include the status of the bloodbrain barrier BBB and lipid solubility molecular weight pKa protein binding and removal of the drug from the CSF by an exit pump in the choroid plexus The most important of these factors is the status of the complex BBB systems The morphologic equivalent of the BBB and its specialized functions eg transport of Dglucose amino acids and ions are discussed in depth Methods developed for increasing drug delivery to the CNS by circumvention andor manipulation of the BBB have included direct injection into the CSF administration of prodrugs or chemical delivery systems or reversible opening of the BBB by hyperosmotic agents pentylenetetrazole etoposide DMSO or other agents The relevance of these general principles to selected examples of CNS infections ie gramnegative aerobic bacillary meningitis and subacute encephalopathy associated with AIDS is emphasized
R726	Clinical signs and symptoms that might predict atlantoaxial subluxation were studied prospectively in 135 of 180 children with Downs syndrome aged 614 years who form the Hester Adrian Research Centre cohort Lateral radiographs of the cervical spine were taken in flexed extended and neutral positions and the percentage of abnormalities in each view was 14 10 and 10 respectively Gait was the only significant clinical predictor The relative risk of having an abnormal neck radiograph with an abnormal gait was 291 95 confidence interval CI 1 to 8 The sensitivity was 50 and the specificity 81 Nineteen children had repeat radiographs to assess the reliability of radiological diagnosis Six had abnormalities five of 19 26 had an abnormality on the first radiograph and four of 19 21 had an abnormality on a second radiograph but only three 15 had an abnormality on both occasions in any view 95 CI 0 to 25 We conclude that radiographs of the cervical spine are unreliable at identifying atlantoaxial subluxation in children with Downs syndrome and we failed to identify any reliable clinical predictor
R727	Three cases are reported in which resolution of severe esophagitic dyspepsia followed amiodarone therapy for cardiac arrhythmias This effect has proved long lasting The mechanism of amiodarone action may be related to its calcium antagonist or nitratelike properties that reduce lower esophageal sphincter tone An alternate hypothesis calls attention to structural similarities between amiodarone and the histamine antagonist ranitidine and suggests a previously unrecognized action of amiodarone on histamine receptors
R728	Of 403 consecutive cases of prostatic carcinoma 69 were diagnosed incidentally and were managed with a deferred treatment policy The mean age at diagnosis was 74 years and mean followup was 42 months Retrospective analysis confirmed that many such patients die of intercurrent disease before symptomatic tumour progression However patients aged 70 years or less at diagnosis with diffuse high grade disease were shown to be at greater risk of symptomatic tumour progression In this study 60 progressed to skeletal metastases within 3 years Deferral of treatment in such patients appears inappropriate
R729	Previous studies show that limited nutrition in the ovariectomized lamb results in an impairment of LH and FSH secretion a phenomenon that is rapidly reversible by increasing the level of nutrition and independent of ovarian steroid feedback The present study characterizes the biosynthesis of pituitary hormones in the nutritionally growthlimited female lamb by measuring steady state mRNA concentrations These changes were examined relatively to pituitary and serum hormone concentrations to establish the relationships of synthesis and secretion in response to nutritional manipulation Ad libitum feeding of nutritionally growthrestricted ovariectomized lambs for 14 days resulted in an increase in the frequency of episodic LH release thereby increasing mean serum LH concentrations P less than 0001 Similarly mean circulating concentrations of FSH were increased P less than 0001 By contrast serum GH concentrations were lowered significantly as a result of ad libitum feeding P less than 005 Serum PRL concentrations remained unchanged Although pituitary LH and PRL concentrations were also unchanged in response to increased nutrition feeding FSH and GH concentrations increased P less than 005 Shortterm ad libitum feeding of the chronically foodrestricted lamb resulted in significant changes in mRNA concentrations for all hormones except PRL The concentrations of gonadotropin subunit mRNAs ie alpha LH beta and FSH beta were all significantly higher in response to increased nutrition P less than 0001 GH mRNA was also affected however feeding decreased concentrations P less than 0001 The results demonstrate that an increase in the level of nutrition in the restricted diet lamb produces profound changes in the synthesis storage and secretion of LH FSH and GH These changes appear to be coordinated although the response differs depending upon the hormone
R730	Bleomycin produces a dose and timedependent interstitial pulmonary fibrosis in humans and is widely used to produce an animal model for the study of interstitial pulmonary fibrosis The mechanisms for bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis is are unknown but the production of oxygen radicals by a ferrous ionmolecular oxygen pathway might be related to the fibrosis Therefore we studied the effect of iron deficiency on the biochemical inflammatory and morphologic parameters of bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis in the hamster Mild iron deficiency was induced in hamsters by bleeding via the retroorbital sinus and maintenance on an irondeplete diet After intratracheal administration of bleomycin 1 U there was no accumulation of lung collagen in the irondeficient bleomycintreated animals In comparison ironreplete animals treated with bleomycin exhibited a significant p less than 001 increase in lung collagen In addition bleomycintreated ironreplete animals had increased lung lipid peroxidation p less than 005 whereas bleomycintreated irondeficient animals did not p greater than 005 Lung DNA and morphometric estimates of the lesion severity were significantly increased in both ironreplete and irondeficient bleomycintreated animals These data indicate that iron deficiency is associated with a reduction in the severity of bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis possibly by the prevention of ironcatalyzed oxygenradical formation and lipid peroxidation
R731	OBJECTIVE To determine the level of interest in and perceptions of the field of internal medicinepediatrics among thirdyear medical students DESIGN A questionnaire was sent to medical students assessing their career choices how they envision their future practices the importance of selected professional goals in relation to their career choices and their impressions of the likelihood of achieving these goals in given medical fields SETTING Two large Midwestern medical schools PARTICIPANTS Medical students at the end of their third year INTERVENTIONS None RESULTS Three hundred of 425 students 70 participated One hundred thirtythree students 44 chose a primary care field as their first choice Seventyone 54 of the 133 chose internal medicinepediatrics as their first second or third choice Students rated the likelihood of achieving certain professional goals by specialty Internal medicinepediatrics was ranked almost identically with internal medicine and pediatrics However internal medicinepediatrics differed from family medicine in that it was ranked higher in intellectual stimulation association with interesting colleagues attaining a position of leadership entering a respected profession and involvement in science and research p less than 00001 CONCLUSIONS The field of internal medicinepediatrics attracts significant interest among medical students and is viewed as similar to internal medicine and less similar to family medicine
R732	Nephrogenic adenoma is an uncommon entity particularly in children This benign lesion is believed to represent urothelial transformation in response to trauma or inflammation Current treatment is local resection with fulguration of the base of the lesion longterm antimicrobial therapy and periodic cystoscopy Our 2 cases support not only the urothelial transformation theory but raise the possibility that immunosuppression may be a contributing factor in these lesions
R733	Substance P neurokinin A neuropeptide K and neurokinin B were measured in both control neurologically normal and Huntingtons disease brains obtained post mortem All four peptides were significantly reduced in the substantia nigra of Huntingtons disease patients compared with the control group No differences were observed in frontal or temporal cortex except that neuropeptide K was significantly reduced in the frontal cortex of Huntingtons disease cases Correlation of the cell loss observed in the striatum and the tachykinin depletions detected in the substantia nigra in the Huntingtons disease brains showed that the degree of cell loss agreed well with the extent of tachykinin depletion Results of doublestaining immunocytochemistry were consistent with the coexistence of substance P and neurokinin A in the substantia nigra of control brains and showed a marked depletion of immunoreactivity to both in Huntingtons disease brains
R734	Prourokinase is a single chain precursor of two chain urokinase which has been shown to induce fibrinselective plasminogen activation In the present study thrombolytic efficacy of 9 million U of glycosylated prourokinase administered intravenously was compared with that of a combined regimen utilizing 45 million U of prourokinase and 02 million U of urokinase Seventyfive patients with a first myocardial infarction were randomized to receive high dose prourokinase n  40 group A or the combination therapy n  35 group B Reperfusion of the infarctrelated artery was assessed by repeat coronary angiography Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction trial TIMI grade II or III reperfusion was achieved in 73 of group A patients compared with 66 of group B patients p  NS A trend toward faster reopening of the infarctrelated artery was observed in patients in group B Coronary artery reocclusion occurred in 5 10 of 49 patients in whom angiography was repeated within 36 h after the start of therapy Clotselective thrombolysis was indicated by a minimal fibrinogen decline 15 and 13 respectively in groups A and B Alpha 2antiplasmin levels however decreased more rapidly in patients in group B p less than 005 This finding and the equivalent reperfusion rate in the combined treatment group strongly suggest synergistic interaction between these two thrombolytic agents In summary the high incidence of reperfusion the low rate of early reocclusion and the paucity of side effects particularly with regard to bleeding complications indicate that prourokinase possesses the characteristics of an ideal thrombolytic agent
R735	The longterm prognosis after thrombolytic therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction AMI is unknown This question was investigated in a 4year followup study of 227 patients According to the status of reperfusion at the end of the acute catheterization the patients were divided into a patent n  171 and an occluded n  56 group Both hospital and 4year mortality rates were significantly reduced in the patent group by 13 and 14 respectively p less than or equal to 0005 for both Baseline variables known to be important for prognosis did not differ between the 2 groups Patients with a patent infarct artery who underwent early acute coronary artery bypass grafting CABG had a greater survival p less than 010 and better left ventricular function p less than 001 than did patients with a patent infarct artery who did not undergo CABG This difference was associated with a lower frequency of fatal reinfarction and cardiogenic shock in the CABG group Thus survival is improved up to 4 years after successful thrombolysis and appears to be further enhanced by early CABG
R736	A strain of luminous bacteria Vibrio fischeri Y1 emits yellow light rather than the bluegreen emission typical of other luminous bacteria The yellow emission has been postulated previously to result from energy transfer from an electronically excited species formed in the bacterial luciferasecatalyzed reaction to a secondary emitter protein termed the yellow fluorescent protein YFP We report here the purification of YFP to homogeneity without loss of the chromophore The protein was found to be a homodimer of Mr 22000 subunits with one weakly bound FMN per subunit The FMNprotein complex was stabilized by 10 volvol glycerol in the buffers allowing purification of the active holoYFP The protein migrated as a single spot with an isoelectric point of approximately 65 on twodimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and gave an Nterminal sequence of MetPheLysGlyIleValGluGlyIleGlyIleIleGluLysIle Addition of purified YFP to a reaction in which luciferase was supplied with FMNH2 reduced FMN by a NADHFMN oxidoreductase resulted in a dramatic enhancement in the intensity of bioluminescence and an additional peak in the emission spectrum at about 534 nm The resulting bimodal bioluminescence emission spectrum had peaks at 484 nm apparently due to emission from the luciferaseflavin complex and at 534 nm corresponding to the fluorescence emission maximum of YFP This bimodal spectrum closely matched the emission spectrum in vivo
R737	The Human Immunodeficiency Virus HIV the causative agent of AIDS is thought to bind to T4 CD4 target cells through the heavily glycosylated gp120 envelope glycoprotein Plant lectins bind glycoproteins through noncovalent interaction with specific hexose residues therefore lectins were evaluated for their ability to inactivate HIV in vitro The mannosespecific lectins concanavalinA and succinyl concanavalinA completely inactivated HIV while lentil lectin wheat germ agglutinin and phytohemagglutininP substantially inactivated HIV BSII Vicia villosa hairy vetch and Ptilota plumosa red marine algae failed to alter the infectibility of HIV Neither simple stearic hindrance viral aggregation nor lectincell interactions served to explain this phenomenon Glycoprotein glycosylation was evaluated by differential lectin binding as well as molecular weight changes in gp120 when virus was produced in the presence of swainsonine a glycosylation inhibitor Lentil lectin bound gp120 better than concanavalinA suggesting the majority of glycosylation sites are fucosylated The apparent molecular weight of gp120 was reduced by swainsonine although HIV infectivity and concanavalinA inactivation were retained Thus at least some Nglycosylation sites are complextype glycoproteins but regions external to the GlcNAc2Man3 core pentasaccharide region are not required for HIV infectivity It appears that the site or sites involved are nonfucosylated high mannose andor biantennary nonsialylated Nglycosylated regions of gp120 or gp41 Alternatively they may be in close approximation to such carbohydrate regions
R738	Congestive heart failure CHF is not a single entity but a symptom complex that may represent the consequence of mechanical abnormalities myocardial abnormalities andor disturbances of cardiac rhythm In turn it affects virtually every organ system in the body This review focuses on CHF due to systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle which comprises the majority of cases of this condition Recent data suggest that CHF may be the most frequent primary diagnosis in patients on medical services in nonmilitary hospitals in this country it affects approximately 2 of the United States population or some 4 million people The mortality rate for CHF is also worse than for many forms of cancer thus new therapeutic alternatives are imperative In order to devise new therapeutic strategies a detailed understanding of the pathophysiology of this condition is required The relative advantages and disadvantages of various pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches are considered in detail Certain medications such as the angiotensin converting enzyme ACE inhibitors have been shown to improve survival and heart transplantation is clearly lifesaving for those who are eligible for this therapy However the real challenge is to devise strategies to prevent the occurrence of heart failure or interrupt its progress at a very early stage
R739	Nmethyl4pyridone3carboxamide 4py is the major metabolite of nicotinamide and nicotinic acid in rats However because it is complicated to determine 4py in humans there is only one report on its excretion Recently we developed a method for the microdetermination of 4py by highperformance liquid chromatography Urinary excretion of 4py in Japanese students from Teikoku Womens University who consumed selfselected foods was 712  325 mumold which is about onefourth of Nmethylnicotinamide MNA and about oneninth of Nmethyl2pyridone5carboxamide 2py excretion The correlation coefficient between daily niacin equivalent NE intake and daily 4py excretion was 0529 which was about the same as the correlation coefficient between daily NE intake and daily 2py excretion and which was two times higher than the correlation coefficient between daily NE intake and daily MNA excretion
R740	Two experiments examined the coding and retention of psychomotor information in patients with mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimertype DAT healthy elderly controls and young adults Experiment 1 compared recall accuracy for preselected subjectdefined and constrained experimenterdefined movements under three different retention conditions Not surprisingly the DAT patients showed significantly larger reproduction errors than did the controls In all three groups however preselected movements were recalled more accurately than constrained movements This preselection advantage was replicated in Experiment 2 using a new group of DAT patients with recall being performed under both same and switchlimb conditions While the results suggested that DAT patients suffer from both an encoding deficiency and a rapid loss of information from shortterm memory they also indicate that patients are capable of coding meaningful aspects of motor movements Most importantly the results suggest that in the motor domain efforts to enhance encoding can facilitate the recall of DAT patients
R741	The cytoskeleton of eukaryotic cells is a major determinant of cellular architecture and of many cellular functions In addition to or in place of the transcellular cytoskeleton many eukaryotic cells also contain membraneassociated cytoskeletal structures membrane skeletons which are important for cellular structure and function The membrane skeleton of the parasitic hemoflagellate Trypanosoma brucei consists of a dense array of singlet microtubules subpellicular microtubules which are tightly associated to the overlying cell membrane This study reports the identification of a microtubuleassociated protein from Trypanosoma brucei that constitutes a component of the link between this microtubular array and the cell membrane The protein can bind in vitro both to microtubules and to membrane vesicles or liposomes Furthermore it can crosslink microtubules and membrane vesicles suggesting that it exerts a similar function in the membrane skeleton
R742	Daynight rhythms occurred in the naloxonereversible 10 mgkg warm opioid and naloxoneinsensitive cold nonopioid swim stressinduced analgesia displayed by CF1 mice Maximum antinociceptive responses were evident at night with the cold stress having significantly greater day and nighttime analgesic effects than the warm stress An exposure for 30 min to a 05 Hz rotating magnetic field 1590 gauss reduced both the warm and cold stressinduced analgesia with the magnetic stimuli having significantly greater inhibitory effects at night and on the opioidinduced responses These results indicate that exposure to oscillating magnetic fields can significantly and differentially alter both opioid and nonopioid stressinduced analgesia and their daynight rhythms
R743	The number of metabolic disorders associated with nonimmune hydrops fetalis is very small and includes only Gaucher disease GM1 gangliosidosis type 1 Hurler syndrome and mucolipidosis type I We report another association of a nonimmune hydrops fetalis with NiemannPick disease as evident by electron microscopy and wish to add this disorder to the list of conditions associated with nonimmune hydrops fetalis
R744	Estrogen has been shown to induce a rapid transient increase in cmyc mRNA in the rat uterus However no studies of the cell specificity of cmyc expression in the uterus have been reported and nothing is known about the expression of cmyc in response to other steroids or during normal uterine preparation for implantation To this end the cell typespecific localization of cmyc protein was determined in the ovariectomized mouse uterus after progesterone P4 andor 17 betaestradiol E2 injection as well as during the periimplantation period After E2 injection a rapid accumulation of cmyc protein was detected exclusively in the uterine luminal and glandular epithelial nuclei in the ovariectomized mouse Essentially all of these cells contained immunoreactive cmyc by 12 h postinjection In contrast after P4 injection rapid accumulation of cmyc was noted exclusively in some of the stromal cell nuclei Pretreatment of the ovariectomized mouse for 4 days with P4 P4 priming followed by E2 injection resulted in an increase in the number of cmycpositive stromal cells but few if any cmycpositive cells were detected in the luminal and glandular epithelia These uterine cell typespecific localizations of cmyc protein induced by E2 or P4 injection were followed within 1824 h by DNA synthesis  3Hthymidine incorporation restricted to the epithelia or stroma respectively cMyc was detected in the nuclei of luminal and glandular epithelia during proestrus and on days 1 and 2 of pregnancy a period when the uterus is under the influence of estrogen cMycpositive cells were detected in the stroma on day 3 and by day 4 a large number of stromal cell nuclei were cmyc positive These changes are coincident with increasing P4 levels during early pregnancy At the implantation chamber on day 5 many cells in the primary decidual zone as well as some of the deeper stromal cells were cmyc protein positive whereas on day 6 cmyc protein was detected only in the secondary decidual zone During this period of uterine preparation for embryo implantation and subsequent decidualization there was a positive correlation between cmyc protein localized in specific populations of uterine cells and subsequent DNA synthesis in those cell types Thus both E2 and P4 induce cell typespecific accumulation of cmyc protein in the uterus of the ovariectomized mouse with E2 induction of cmyc being restricted to epithelia and P4 induction restricted to stromaABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS
R745	The detection of fine linear contours and altered aeration are requirements for the radiologic diagnosis of bullous lung disease and are severe measures of the spatial and contrast resolution of chest imaging systems We compared plain film radiography with five postprocessing algorithms of storage phosphor digital radiography 2144 x 1744 x 10 bit matrix with 02mm pixel size in the detection of CTproved bullous lung disease 35 patients and 25 normal control subjects Receiveroperatingcharacteristic analysis of 2160 observations by six interpreters was done to evaluate the observers performance By analysis of variance p less than 05 we found that the default digital algorithm and the three edgeenhancing algorithms of high and medium frequencies performed less well than plain films did but the differences fell short of statistical significance Grayscale reversal was the only digital algorithm that performed significantly less well than plain films did We conclude that any differences between digital algorithms and plain films in the detection of bullous lung disease were too small to be detected in this study Any difference between the two methods in providing clinically important diagnostic information is likely to be insignificant
R746	A review of all autopsy and toxicology reports for persons dying in New York City in an 11month period found 935 persons dying with cocaine in their bodies Cocainepositive fatalities were more likely in the young black and Hispanic and male population In addition to cocaine and its metabolites heroin and other opiates were found in 39 of persons and ethanol in 33 and barbiturates and minor tranquilizers in only 2 of the deceased Cocaine overdose was responsible for 4 of the deaths and overdose with heroin and cocaine for 12 of the deaths Violence was often the cause of death Thirtyeight percent died of homicide seven percent of suicide and eight percent from accidents Of particular interest were 6 persons who died of acute cardiac events directly related to cocaine as well as 4 cases of ruptured dissections of the ascending aorta and 9 cases of cerebral hemorrhage Autopsy findings for these individuals are described and possible mechanisms of death are discussed
R747	The distribution of two major basement membrane components type IV collagen and laminin was studied within the perisinusoidal space of Disse in normal human liver using i an immunoperoxidase method for light microscopy and ii immunogold labelling for ultrastructural localisation Although immunoreactivity depended on the mode of tissue fixation both proteins could be identified at this site using a panel of affinity purified antibodies These findings indicate that these proteins are normal constituents of the perisinusoidal extracellular matrix and refute the hypothesis that capillarization of the sinusoids in chronic liver disease results from neoexpression of laminin in the space of Disse
R748	Three hundred fourteen unselected babies were examined within 96 hours of delivery Three 1 of the infants had clinically recognizable pigmented lesions Two of the lesions mean 06 range 0123 95 confidence limits proved histologically to be compound melanocytic nevi The histology displayed almost identical patterns with large nests of melanocytes at the dermoepidermal junction and only few nevus cells in the papillary dermis A 06 incidence rate corresponds to 330 congenital melanocytic nevi in Denmark each year range 551265 95 confidence limits Because histology does not seem to be an accurate diagnostic tool to sort out the malignant potential of the small congenital melanocytic nevi prospective studies are needed to characterize the premalignant melanocytic nevi whether congenital or acquired
R749	Severe hyponatremia developed within 2 weeks of head injuries in three elderly patients Before the head injuries occurred normal serum levels of sodium had been found in two of the three patients Hyponatremia 105 to 117 meqL was associated with persistently increased urinary excretion of sodium The patients appeared dehydrated and had lost weight The mean plasma level of antidiuretic hormone was 50  16 SD pgmL which was relatively high despite decreased osmolality Plasma renin activity was suppressed to 025  013 ngmL X h and plasma aldosterone levels measured lownormal or normal Plasma renin activity and plasma aldosterone levels remained unchanged after the patients were given furosemide and placed in an upright position The hyponatremia promptly resolved after the administration of fludrocortisone acetate 01 to 04 mgd These observations indicate that severe hyponatremia occurs in elderly persons rapidly after head injuries that it responds well to mineralocorticoid hormone therapy and that both central nervous system and renal components may be involved in the mechanisms of action of the disorder
R750	The effect of corticosteroids on the immune response after severe injury and hemorrhagic shock was studied in 88 patients who received an average of 13 blood transfusions for injury and hemorrhagic shock which caused the systolic blood pressure to be below 80 torr for an average of 29 minutes The immune response to tetanus toxoid was tested in the postoperative period Besides the administration of blood crystalloid solution and plasma for coagulation factor deficiency 42 patients also received methylprednisolone 1 g during additional resuscitation followed by an average of 15 mgkg given daily for the next 2 days The total dose of methylprednisolone averaged 39 g The two groups of patients were similar for resuscitation needs and for insult The immune response to tetanus toxoid was not significantly different between the two groups of patients These data show that a shortterm bolus of massive steroids does not appear to alter significantly the immune mechanism following severe hemorrhagic shock
R751	Pseudoaneurysm has been reported in the literature as a cause of compartment syndrome The onset of the subsequent compartment syndrome is usually early Often while the compartment syndrome is diagnosed and treated the pseudoaneurysm is missed A second operative procedure is then necessary A 40yearold woman illustrates an unusual case of a late compartment syndrome following the development of a radial artery pseudoaneurysm three weeks after a penetrating injury It is important to investigate the vascular tree in compartment syndromes after a penetrating injury no matter how late the patient is seen
R752	The following groups were compared 1 children less than 18 years old who have hemophiliaassociated acquired immunodeficiency syndrome AIDS with other children with AIDS and with adults who have hemophiliaassociated AIDS and 2 asymptomatic HIVinfected hemophilic children with asymptomatic HIVinfected hemophilic adults Children with hemophiliaassociated AIDS were older than other children with AIDS medians 13 and 1 years respectively and less frequently had lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis 5 v 48 but had similar incidences of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia 51 v 53 and similar case to fatality ratios 59 v 61 Children with hemophiliaassociated AIDS had P carinii pneumonia significantly less often than did adults with hemophiliaassociated AIDS but both had similar case to fatality ratios adults 72 with P carinii pneumonia 68 dead Significantly more hemophilic children than adults with AIDS were nonwhite 30 v 14 and resided in the tristate area of New YorkNew JerseyPennsylvania 43 v 25 The immune effects of human immunodeficiency virus HIV to date on asymptomatic pediatric and adult hemophiliacs are similar but may be more severe in adults It is concluded that although some of the clinical manifestations of AIDS eg lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis occurring or not occurring in older children infected through blood factor products differ from those of other children with AIDS disease outcome to date is equally poor The reasons for the differences between hemophilic children and hemophilic adults with and without AIDS warrant further investigation
R753	A recently developed tetrazoliumbased microculture assay was used to screen extracts of cultured cyanobacteria bluegreen algae for inhibition of the cytopathic effects of the human immunodeficiency virus HIV1 which is implicated as a causative agent of AIDS A number of extracts were found to be remarkably active against the AIDS virus A new class of HIV1inhibitory compounds the sulfonic acidcontaining glycolipids was discovered through the use of the microculture assay to guide the fractionation and purification process The pure compounds were active against HIV1 in cultured human lymphoblastoid CEM MT2 LDV7 and C344 cell lines in the tetrazolium assay as well as in p24 viral protein and syncytium formation assays
R754	A static force plate system was used to examine postural sway characteristics in 16 hemiplegic patients and in 34 normal elderly subjects The effectiveness of postural sway center of pressure biofeedback was compared to conventional physical therapy practices in reestablishing stance stability in hemiplegic patients Postural sway abnormalities in hemiplegic patients included significant mean lateral displacement of sway towards the nonaffected leg and increased total sway area Postural sway biofeedback was more effective than conventional physical therapy practices in reducing mean lateral displacement of sway This was associated with increased loading of the affected leg Posttreatment changes in total sway area were not significantly different between experimental and control groups
R755	Developing and evaluating connectionist models also called neural models is a difficult and timeconsuming task To address this issue we designed a software system called Maryland MIRRORSII for the construction of connectionist models in biomedicine and other fields Maryland MIRRORSII is distinguished from previous and current related systems by its support of a highlevel nonprocedural language a generalpurpose eventhandling mechanism and an indexed library of system resources These features make Maryland MIRRORSII a convenient software tool for use in biomedicine This paper describes Maryland MIRRORSII and provides a simple example in which it uses error back propagation learning to select the appropriate treatment for a given set of manifestations
R756	Eight persons with asthma were exposed to seven air conditions varying in temperature 37 degrees C to 49 degrees C 986 degrees F to 1202 degrees F and water content 44 mg H2O per liter to 79 mg H2Oper liter  Normocapnic hyperventilation for three minutes at 40 maximal voluntary ventilation was carried out for each condition A constantvolume body plethysmograph measured the functional residual capacity and specific airway conductance SGaw followed by two forced expiratory manuevers Measurements were taken before and 1 5 10 and 20 minutes after each challenge Air conditions with 100 relative humidity caused a fall in the SGaw that was maximal in 1 minute Air conditions at 100 relative humidity caused a greater fall in both the forced expiratory volume in 1 second FEV1 P05 and the SGaw P005 than did conditions of the same temperature but less water content At 44 degrees C and 100 relative humidity the mean percent change in FEV1 and SGaw was 2 and 40 respectively at 1 minute after challenge Of the conditions examined the optimal temperature was 44 degrees C and we speculate that the optimal water content is less than 44 mg H2O per liter Inhaled water concentrations exceeding 44 mg H2O per liter should probably not be used in patients with asthma
R757	Emergency coronary artery bypass grafting after failed elective percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty can be performed with acceptable complication rates Recently however a new class of patients with unsuccessful angioplasty has evolved with the use of thrombolytic therapy and emergent angioplasty as treatment for developing acute myocardial infarction The efficacy of surgical intervention after failure of angioplasty in this setting has not been demonstrated This report compares the results of coronary bypass done emergently after either failed elective or failed emergent angioplasty Between March 1984 and September 1986 1350 angioplasty procedures were performed at our institution 393 for acute myocardial infarction Of the 111 patients who came to operation 42 had had unsuccessful elective angioplasty and 69 unsuccessful angioplasty done in the clinical setting of an evolving acute myocardial infarction detected by electrocardiographic criteria Twentyone of the 42 patients having unsuccessful elective angioplasty group I and 32 of the 69 with unsuccessful emergent angioplasty group II underwent emergency coronary artery bypass grafting A retrospective nonparametric statistical comparison of the two groups was performed Age preoperative ejection fraction distribution of vessels undergoing angioplasty and number of vessels bypassed were not statistically different All group II patients received thrombolytic therapy and a reperfusion catheter was used in over half the patients in each group Three group I and six group II patients required a preoperative balloon pump and half the patients in each group required postoperative inotropic support One patient in group I 47 and two patients in group II 62 died no significant difference Only five patients in group I 238 and 11 in group II 343 had enzymatic and electrocardiographic evidence of an acute myocardial infarction at discharge Six patients in group II 156 required reexploration for bleeding versus none in group I p  004 Nonhemorrhagic complication rates mean inpatient and acute care days total hospital charges and blood product utilization rates were not statistically different These data indicate that emergency coronary artery bypass grafting can be performed when necessary in the setting of failed emergent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty with results comparable to coronary bypass after failed elective angioplasty
R758	The leukocyte adherence inhibition LAI test in arthritis is a model of cooperation between monocytes T cells and polymorphonuclear cells PMN Mononuclear cells MNC from patients with rheumatoid arthritis in contact with aggregated IgG release within 60 min in the test tube a supernatant capable of inhibiting the adherence of PMN to glass LAI activity By protein labeling fractionation and electroblotting we showed that the supernatant LAI activity was located in the 1420 kDa region of the gel and was actively secreted upon MNC stimulation Under negative conditions the factors with LAI activity were able to constitute larger complexes and their charge was heterogeneous Their relationship to interleukin1 IL1 is discussed since the supernatant gave a positive response in the thymocyte proliferation assay small amounts of IL1 had the capacity to inhibit PMN adhesiveness and antiIL1 blocked this activity
R759	Treatment of oral leukoplakia has been disappointing with the available treatment modalities because of inaccurate removal and an approximate 30 to 35 rate of recurrence The CO2 laser has provided a promising new approach in the management of these lesions with very low morbidity and improved control Twentynine patients were treated with the CO2 laser for 38 extensive from 1 x 1 cm to 6 x 8 cm intraoral leukoplakic lesions 28 for cure and one for palliation Microscopically the lesions varied from hyperkeratosis to carcinoma in situ Followup of these patients ranges from 3 to 10 years with an average of 5 years An initial recurrence rate of 108 437 was observed and a 3year local control rate of 97 after one to two procedures A malignant transformation rate of 26 was encountered Excellent wound healing and few complications were observed with this treatment approach Surgical technique and results are reported supporting the advantages of the CO2 laser over conventional modes of treatment in the management of oral leukoplakia
R760	Evaluating new antimicrobial agents is governed mostly by interaction between the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration FDA Clinical trials are designed to comply with FDA guidelines published in 1977 Basic principles of the 1977 guidelines remain valid however changes in the clinical application of antiinfective agents and in the accepted design of clinical trials have occurred Some changes are inconsistent with the requirements of the 1977 documents Members of the Infectious Diseases Society of America IDSA have the perspective and knowledge needed to assist in updating the 1977 guidelines It is proposed that the IDSA establish a formal working relationship with the FDA to review and modernize the 1977 guidelines Industry participation in this process is desirable If the IDSA can help orchestrate guideline revision in an environment of mutual respect and cooperation the result may be a more efficient drugevaluation process that continues to protect the public interest and is more consistent with contemporary concepts of treatment for infectious disease
R761	The search for the genes encoding the Tcell receptor TCR alpha and betasubunits revealed a third gene gamma which shares with the alpha and betagenes several properties including somatic rearrangement This gene together with a fourth rearranging gene delta encodes a second type of Tcell receptor TCR gamma delta Although TCR gamma deltabearing T cells constitute a relatively minor subpopulation in the thymus and in peripheral lymphoid organs they are the major lymphocytes of epidermis dendritic epidermal cells or DEC and of intestinal epithelium intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes or IEL in mice suggesting that at least some gamma delta T cells are important in the surveillance of a variety of epithelia It was recently reported however that the TCR gamma delta on DEC has essentially no structural diversity implying that the putative ligand is monomorphic As this finding if generally applicable poses severe restrictions on the origin of the ligand we investigated the diversity of the TCR on the second major epitheliumassociated gamma delta T cells namely IEL from mice We report here that by contrast with the DEC gamma delta the IEL gamma delta TCR are structurally diverse
R762	The present study examines acute potassiuminduced insulin and aldosterone responses in renal failure and the role of chronic dietary potassium intake in modifying these acute responses Plasma aldosterone PA and insulin IRI responses to acute KCl infusion were examined in control and remnant kidney dogs on two potassium intakes Dogs N  8 received the KCl infusions after 10 days of a 60 and then 10 days of a 200 mEq daily potassium intake during control and after surgicalinduced renal failure CRF A one hour intravenous infusion of KCl 2 mEq KClkghr in dextrose and water was performed with blood samples for PA IRI creatinine and electrolytes and urine for electrolytes and creatinine at 20 minute intervals one hour preceding during and after the infusion Preinfusion PA was higher P less than 005 in controls and CRF dogs on 200 mEq potassium intake compared to 60 mEq potassium intake The peak incremental responses of PA to KCl infusion were increased P less than 001 in CRF compared to controls on 60 mEq PA 36  42 vs 26  30 ngdl and 200 mEq delta PA 49  56 vs 37  28 ngdl potassium intakes Differences in incremental PA responses in CRF were not due to altered aldosterone metabolic clearance rates changes in renin or ACTH activity Preinfusion IRI was higher P less than 005 in CRF than control dogs on both potassium dietsABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R763	The presence of macrophages is required for the regeneration of many cell types during wound healing Macrophages have been reported to express a wide range of mitogenic factors and cytokines but none of these factors has been shown in vivo to sustain all the woundhealing processes It has been suggested that transforming growth factoralpha TGFalpha may mediate angiogenesis epidermal regrowth and formation of granulation tissue in vivo Macrophages isolated from a wound site and not exposed to cell culture conditions expressed messenger RNA transcripts for TGFalpha TGFbeta plateletderived growth factor Achain and insulinlike growth factor1 The expression of these transcripts was determined by a novel method for RNA analysis in which low numbers of mouse macrophages were isolated from wound cylinders their RNA was purified and reversetranscribed and the complementary DNA was amplified in a polymerase chain reaction primed with growth factor sequencespecific primers This singlecell RNA phenotyping procedure is rapid and has the potential for quantification and mRNA transcripts from a single cell or a few cells can be unambiguously demonstrated with the simultaneous analysis of several mRNA species Macrophages from wounds expressed TGFalpha antigen and wound fluids contained TGFalpha Elicited macrophages in culture also expressed TGFalpha transcripts and polypeptide in a timedependent manner after stimulation with modified lowdensity lipoproteins and lipopolysaccharide endotoxin which are characteristic of the activators found in injured tissues
R764	A 16yearold girl had hearing loss paroxysmal tremor gait disorders and psychiatric disturbances as the initial manifestations of a cryptococcal meningoencephalitis Imaging demonstrated an obstructive hydrocephalus and neurootological explorations showed a retrocochlear deafness and diffuse brainstem involvement Emphasis is on the deafness which rarely occurs as a presenting symptom in this condition and on its dramatic improvement following antimycotic therapy
R765	In a previous study we showed that moderate to severe stress during pregnancy was inversely related to infant birth weight Using the same criteria for stress according to the Social Readjustment Rating Scale of Holmes and Rahe we studied 86 white mothers with singleton pregnancies and with no known medical or obstetric risk factors for reduced birth weight After strict randomization data were analyzed for 43 mothers who received psychosocial support between enrollment at  20 weeks and delivery at  38 weeks and for 43 control mothers who received standard care at the antenatal clinic In the supported group seven infants weighed less than 3000 gm at birth versus 18 control infants p  0008 and analysis revealed that this effect was more the result of improved intrauterine growth than of prolongation of pregnancy These findings are of little clinical relevance as far as the neonate is concerned but they do indicate that psychosocial support has a significant effect on birth weight It is possible that previous studies that have looked only for an effect on low or verylowbirthweight rates might have missed this clinically measurable benefit of counseling
R766	We determined the ability of the thromboxane A2 antagonist SQ 29548 or diltiazem to enhance postischemic myocardial function and if the effects of these compounds were occurring during occlusion or reperfusion periods Anesthetized openchest dogs were pretreated with iv saline SQ 29548 020 mgkg  020 mgkghr or diltiazem 018 mgkg 15 min before the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded In another group animals were given saline SQ 29548 or diltiazem 1 min before reperfusion The occlusion was maintained for 15 min and reperfusion instituted for 5 hr Subendocardial segmental shortening was monitored throughout the experiment using sonomicrometry Left anterior descending coronary artery occlusion resulted in marked systolic bulging to similar levels in all groups Upon reperfusion function returned immediately but after several min hypokinesia existed in salinetreated animals At 5hr postreperfusion percentage of shortening returned to only 20 of baseline values in salinetreated animals Both diltiazem and SQ 29548 pretreatment resulted in significant P less than 05 improvements in function such that at 5hr postreperfusion shortening returned to 60 of baseline values When given immediately before reperfusion SQ 29548 still resulted in significant protection of function although this occurred much later compared to pretreated animals Diltiazem did not improve function when given immediately before reperfusion SQ 29548 improves reperfusion function and thus by inference thromboxane A2 may play a role in postischemic hypokinesia and some of its protective effects may occur during reperfusion Diltiazem seems to protect reperfusion function only when present during ischemia per se
R767	This study considers the effect of the removal of a ventilation tube from the tympanic membrane of an ear which has been affected with persistent mucopurulent discharge for at least 3 months The records of 332 patients were reviewed Thirtythree patients with 34 ears satisfied the entry criteria Tube removal cured 27 out of 34 ears 79 of aural discharge within 1 month The tympanic membrane healing rates were at 1 month 14 41 at 3 months 23 68 at 6 months 24 71 and at 1 year 28 82 A table is presented comparing perforation rates from different ventilation tube studies
R768	The objective of this study is to determine which inflammatory mediators had direct effects on canine trachealis muscle neuromuscular control to identify candidate mediators of the hyperresponsiveness observed in vitro after O3 exposure Studies were carried out in the sucrose gap at 29 degrees C and in the muscle bath at 37 degrees C Leukotriene LT B4 LTD4 and prostaglandin PG D2 had neither direct nor significant effects on the excitatory junction potentials EJPs the secondary membrane potential oscillations or the associated contractions that followed field stimulation of cholinergic nerves U 46619 a stable analogue of thromboxane Tx A2 enhanced 1010107 M the duration and the amplitude of secondary oscillations and associated contractions without affecting the EJPs In the muscle bath U 46619 enhanced fieldstimulated contractions this was antagonized competitively by SQ 29548 In both the sucrose gap and the muscle bath higher concentrations 109 M and higher caused direct effects small depolarizations and contractions These effects of U 46619 were unaffected by indomethacin or guanethidine but were abolished by SQ 29548 an antagonist selective at TxA2PGH2 receptors U 46619 at 109 M did not affect electrical or mechanical responses to acetylcholine and at 109 M did not increase the sensitivity to acetylcholine Plateletactivating factor PAF was inactive in all musclebath and most sucrosegap experiments In 7 of 20 of the latter it caused effects qualitatively like those of U 46619 but whether it acted through release of TxA2 could not be tested because of the rapid tachyphylaxis to PAF We conclude that TxA2 may mediate the hyperresponsiveness found in vitro after O3 treatment
R769	In spite of all that has been written about the varicocele it is still not clear who will benefit from occlusion of the spermatic vein or why improvement in semen takes place in some patients but not in others Because fertility is usually assessed in the framework of a couple who are trying to establish a pregnancy it is important to evaluate both partners before making any recommendations regarding therapy If the man is found to have a varicocele and semen analyses that indicate deficits in either the quantity or quality of the sperm surgical ligation or transvenous occlusion should be considered as one appropriate form of therapy Varicocele ligation and embolotherapy both can be performed as an outpatient procedure with minimal morbidity and equal effectiveness regarding pregnancy outcome The cost if the procedures are done in an outpatient facility should be approximately equal The obvious benefits of the percutaneous technique are a slightly lower recurrence rate and a more rapid return to full physical activity The surgical procedure described by Marmar and associates appears to have a similar rate of recurrence and short postoperative period of recovery Greater experience by more urologists using this technique needs to be gained to compare it adequately with the other methods described Varicocele ligation by the inguinal or retroperitoneal routes is familiar to most urologists and does not require the operating microscope or other special instruments With greater understanding of the venous anatomy and with careful dissection the persistence and recurrence rate can be acceptably low and the postoperative recovery relatively rapid and smooth
R770	The effects of angiotensinconverting enzyme inhibition ACEI by enalapril on splanchnic n  10 and central hemodynamics n  9 were examined in moderately saltdepleted healthy volunteers at rest and during 1520 min of lower body negative pressure LBNP reducing mean arterial pressure by 10 mmHg During LBNP before ACEI both splanchnic and total peripheral vascular resistances increased During ACEI splanchnic and total peripheral vascular resistances decreased After enalapril administration splanchnic vascular resistance did not increase during LBNP Total peripheral vascular resistance still increased but not to the same extent as during LBNP before ACEI The increases in heart rate and plasma norepinephrine during LBNP were attenuated after ACEI compared with LBNP before ACEI The effectiveness of the ACEI was clearly demonstrated by unchanged and low plasma angiotensin II levels during ACEI We conclude that in normal sodiumdepleted humans acute ACEI decreases splanchnic vascular resistance at rest and abolishes splanchnic vasoconstriction during LBNP Furthermore it may interfere with autonomic nervous system control of the circulation
R771	Alpha 1antitrypsinPittsburgh ATP a naturally occurring lethal mutation 358MetArg has been genetically engineered rATP The protein has been shown to be a potent active sitedirected inhibitor of thrombin and the contact enzymes Factor XIIf Factor XIa and kallikrein Because activation of the contact system is known to occur in gramnegative septicemia the authors have hypothesized that the administration of rATP might modulate the course of this syndrome Yorkshire piglets anesthetized with pentobarbital and infused with viable Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2 X 108 CFU were untreated Group I or treated with rATP Group II and studied in a 6hour protocol Coagulation studies revealed that rATP significantly inhibited the rapid decrease in the functional concentrations of Antithrombin III Factor XI and fibrinogen In addition rATP markedly reduced the serum levels of fibrinogen degradation products Survival in Group II was significantly increased during 25 hours but not at 6 hours when the functional levels of rATP in plasma were the lowest These results indicate that this recombinant inhibitor even at low concentrations affords protection in experimental gramnegative septicemia
R772	Although rare hemangiomas and lymphangiomas of the oral cavity are difficult management problems Surgical resection is still commonly thought of by many when considering treatment Several articles in 1986 reported good results using the neodymiumyttriumaluminumgarnet laser for these lesions Using this laser we have treated six patients with hemangiomas or lymphangiomas of the oral cavity over the past 4 years Although most patients have required several treatments the response has been excellent overall This report confirms the results of previous studies
R773	The duration of effect of inhaled formoterol 24 micrograms was compared with that of a placebo and that of inhaled albuterol 200 micrograms in 12 adult asthmatic subjects who underwent hyperventilation tests with cold dry air 20 degrees C on 4 study days On the control day they were subjected to four hyperventilation tests to ensure functional stability On the 3 remaining days after a first hyperventilation test they inhaled placebo albuterol or formoterol in randomized doubleblind fashion The hyperventilation test was repeated 1 4 and 8 h and if the blocking effect was still present 12 and 24 h after the drug had been administered The dose of hyperventilation of cold air causing a 20 fall in FEV1 PD20 was interpolated on the doseresponse curve The magnitude of the blocking effect at each time interval on each study day was assessed by comparing the changes in PD20 from baseline with the withinday variability of PD20 standardized change in PD20 The acute bronchodilator effect was not significantly different as assessed 15 min 21  14 for albuterol and 18  18 for formoterol and 1 h 20  13 for albuterol and 18  17 for formoterol after administering the medication The duration of the blocking effect defined as the return to 2 SD from the standardized change in PD20 was significantly more prolonged for formoterol 80  34 h than for albuterol 30  17 h t  42 p less than 00001ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R774	BACKGROUND There is no satisfactory treatment for refractory ascites in patients with cirrhosis Both peritoneovenous shunts and paracentesis have been used but there is uncertainty about their relative merits METHODS We studied 89 patients with cirrhosis and refractory ascites who were randomly assigned to receive either repeated largevolume paracentesis plus intravenous albumin or a LeVeen peritoneovenous shunt Patients in the paracentesis group in whom recurrent tense ascites developed during followup were treated with paracentesis and those in the peritoneovenousshunt group with diuretic agents or by the insertion of a new shunt if there was shunt obstruction RESULTS During the first hospitalization ascites was removed in all 41 patients in the paracentesis group and in 44 of the 48 patients in the peritoneovenousshunt group The mean  SD duration of hospitalization in the two groups was 11  5 and 19  9 days respectively P less than 001 There were no significant differences in the number of patients who had complications or died During followup 37 patients in each group were hospitalized again In the paracentesis group the number of rehospitalizations for any reason 174 vs 97 in the peritoneovenousshunt group or for ascites 125 vs 38 was significantly higher and the median time to a first readmission for any reason 1  1 vs 2  2 months or for ascites 2  2 vs 8  17 months was significantly shorter than in the peritoneovenousshunt group The total times in the hospital during followup however were similar in the two groups 48  49 and 44  39 days respectively Three patients had obstructions of their peritoneovenous shunts during their first hospitalizations and 15 patients had a total of 20 obstructions during followup Survival was similar in both groups CONCLUSIONS The LeVeen shunt and paracentesis are equally effective in relieving refractory ascites The former may provide better longterm control of ascites but shunt occlusion is common and survival is not improved
R775	As part of a 3year longitudinal study of lipid and hormonal changes during puberty 536 boys aged 10 to 15 years were prospectively followed every 6 months to assess development of gynecomastia The overall prevalence of gynecomastia in the 377 with complete data was 485 51 of white subjects and 46 of black subjects In the majority of subjects gynecomastia developed during midpuberty Gynecomastia was bilateral in 55 of subjects on the left side in 19 and on the right in 26 Gynecomastia was documented for only one visit in the majority of subjects When subjects were matched at the onset of gynecomastia for race visit number and pubertal rating there were no significant differences between those with or without gynecomastia in serum estradiol level testosterone level estrogentestosterone ratio or dehydroepiandrosteronesulfate level However free testosterone level weight and Quetelet index were all significantly lower and the testosteroneestrogen binding globulin level was significantly greater in those with gynecomastia We conclude that approximately half of adolescent boys have transient gynecomastia usually lasting less than 1 year those with gynecomastia enter midpuberty at an earlier age have a lower Quetelet index and have lower serum free testosterone levels
R776	In the present study we have examined the in vivo effects of thyroid hormone and TRH on secretory tissue concentrations of TRH and TRHGly pGluHisProGly a TRH precursor Within secretory granules TRHGly is converted to TRH through alphaamidation of the Cterminal proline residue using Gly as the NH2 donor Using specific RIA we measured the TRHGly immunoreactivity TRHGlyIR and TRHIR concentrations in tissues from the reproductive and gastrointestinal systems adrenals and other internal organs in euthyroid hypothyroid and T4treated 250g SpragueDawley male rats TRHGlyIR concentrations were more than 2fold higher than TRHIR concentrations within the adrenal pancreas bowel and stomach at the time of death Untreated hypothyroidism and exogenous TRH significantly increased adrenal TRHGlyIR levels Pancreatic TRHGly levels increased about 2fold in hypothyroid rats Incubation at 60 C significantly increased TRHGlyIR levels in the pancreas adrenal bowel stomach and epididymis by 14 3 6 6 and 6fold respectively Also after 60 C incubation increases in the TRHGlyIRTRHIR ratio of 27 4 and 17fold were observed in the pancreas epididymis and bowel respectively Pooled tissue extracts were fractionated by cation exchange and reverse phase HPLC for characterization of TRHGlyIR Both chromatographic methods revealed a major peak of TRHGlyIR coeluting with synthetic TRHGly Incubation at 60 C caused 135 41 15 and 5fold increments in the TRHGlyIR for adrenal pancreas prostate and thyroid respectively compared to the immediately extracted control aliquots Cation exchange and reverse phase HPLC also revealed production of higher mol wt TRH precursor peptides after incubation at 60 C for 4 or 20 h Only the TRHGlyIR peak coeluting with pGluHisProGly was converted into TRH by rat brain alphaamidating enzyme The data suggest that biosynthesis of TRH occurs in rat extrahypothalamic tissues and may be modulated by thyroid status iv TRH and selective thermal inactivation of enzymes that convert preproTRH to TRH
R777	A multimethod needs assessment generated both qualitative and quantitative data about continuing professional education needs and interests of Pennsylvania clinical dietitians The study also evaluated three different needs assessment procedures First data were obtained from 22 clinical dietitians invited to participate in focus group interviews The dietitians suggested continuing education topics representing four aspects of practice clinical procedural professional development and management skills With the data obtained two needs assessment instruments subsequently were prepared and distributed at a statewide conference Fourteen percent of 650 attending dietitians volunteered to participate in the needs assessment process Fortyfour completed a survey using an electronic preference recording device and 50 completed printed questionnaires Although not directly comparable responses to both questionnaire formats generally confirmed suggestions obtained from focus groups Topics such as computer applications patient education staff development and time management led the wide variety of choices selected Respondents favored live affordable conveniently located programs delivered effectively by experts using a participatory format Of the three assessment procedures used focus group interviews provided the most detailed information for planning continuing education Surveys based on focus group results are useful for contributing quantitative data We conclude that a comprehensive plan for dietitians professional development through continuing professional education should include structured needs assessments The assessments are necessary to determine the diverse and changing concerns needs and preferences of dietitians and the organizations employing them
R778	We measured regional cerebral blood flow and 123Iiodoamphetamine IMP uptake in 16 patients with unilateral brain infarcts during the subacute period Day 3 to Day 50 and again after 3 months Our results show that the central and peripheral areas described earlier in the chronic period were already differentiated in the subacute period The central area presented a short phase of luxury perfusion and a longer phase of IMP hyperfixation The peripheral area showed both a slight regional cerebral blood flow decrease and an early IMP uptake decrease similar to those previously found in the chronic period Contralateral regional cerebral blood flow during the subacute period considered normal was significantly lower than that during the chronic period
R779	The authors studied the effects of dihydroergotamine DHE and etilefrine hydrochloride E on the regional distribution of 99mTcmarked erythrocytes during epidural anesthesia in eight supine men to determine if vasoactive agents with venoconstrictor action would enhance cardiac filling during epidural anesthesia Radioactivity was recorded with a gamma camera and its distribution determined in the thorax abdomen and limbs Arterial and central venous pressure heart rate and calf volume by plethysmography were measured During epidural anesthesia with a sensory block up to T45 DHE 75 microgramskg reduced the radioactivity ie blood volume in both the innervated 59  35 and denervated muscleskin 169  7 regions and increased it in both the intrathoracic 70  23 and splanchnic vasculature 42  32 In contrast E 6 micrograms X kg1 X min1 decreased the blood volume most markedly in the splanchnic region 54  07 and increased it in the thorax 2  06 All these changes were statistically significant The combined effects were estimated to be equivalent to a transfusion of nearly 101 of blood Both drugs reversed the hypotensive action of epidural anesthesia During epidural anesthesia DHE preferentially constricted the capacitance vessels in skeletal muscle and skin irrespective of the state of innervation whereas E preferentially constricted the splanchnic vasculature In the doses used the two agents replenished in an additive fashion the central circulation during epidural anesthesia
R780	1 The serum concentrations of 25hydroxyvitamin D and 125dihydroxyvitamin D were measured in 44 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism 2 In 14 patients the serum concentration of 125dihydroxyvitamin D was greater than normal 142337 pmoll One patient had a subnormal concentration of 125dihydroxyvitamin D 36 pmoll but no other evidence of vitamin D deficiency 3 The possible biological determinants of the serum concentration of 125dihydroxyvitamin D were sought by multivariate analysis of relevant variables The serum concentration of 125dihydroxyvitamin D was found to be significantly and positively correlated with the serum concentrations of 25hydroxyvitamin D P less than 0001 and parathyroid hormone P less than 0003 and with the glomerular filtration rate P less than 003 and negatively correlated with the serum concentrations of calcium P less than 002 and phosphate P  0055 multiple R  0638 P less than 0002 4 In primary hyperparathyroidism the major determinant of serum 125dihydroxyvitamin D is the availability of precursor 25hydroxyvitamin D 5 The finding that serum 125dihydroxyvitamin D is commonly normal in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism despite an adequate state of vitamin D nutrition can be explained in terms of the constraining influences of hypercalcaemia and variable degrees of renal dysfunction on the biosynthesis of 125dihydroxyvitamin D
R781	Through April 30 1991 epidemic cholera has been reported from five countries in South America Brazil Chile Colombia Ecuador and Peru In addition in the United States a total of 10 confirmed cases of epidemicassociated cholera have been reported in Georgia New Jersey and Florida This report summarizes information regarding the cases reported in New Jersey and Florida
R782	We correlated the clinical and pathologic findings in 77 consecutive carotid plaques removed at endarterectomy to determine the clinical role of intraplaque hemorrhage Intraplaque hemorrhages of various severity were seen in 86 of plaques They were for the most part deeply located 63 and infrequently connected with the lumen They related closely to the severity of carotid stenosis but bore no relationship to the timing of symptoms Luminal thrombus was infrequently seen and was always microscopic Hemorrhage into carotid plaque appears to represent an index of the severity of the stenosis and plaque instability rather than to play a direct role in the pathogenesis of transient ischemic attacks or stroke
R783	PURPOSE The study objective was to evaluate the effects of longterm methadone use and human Tcell leukemia virus HTLV types I and II seropositivity on the distribution of lymphocyte subsets and on lymphocyte function as measured in vitro in intravenous drug users seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV1 PATIENTS AND METHODS AntiHIV1negative intravenous drug users receiving methadone maintenance therapy n  24 were studied in a Veterans Administration drug abuse treatment center These subjects were compared to 38 age and sexmatched control subjects who did not abuse drugs HIV1 and HTLV serostatus was determined by repetitive enzymelinked immunosorbent assay and confirmed by immunoblot Lymphocyte subsets were determined by twocolor flow cytometry Lymphocyte function was measured by proliferative response to plant mitogens and by natural killer NK cellmediated cytotoxicity to a tumor cell target RESULTS Significant differences were seen in lymphocyte phenotype in the methadonetreated group with elevations in the Tcell helper subset CD4CD26 in CD8 and CD8I2 cells suppressorcytotoxic T lymphocytes and activated suppressorcytotoxic T cells and in CD2CD26 cells and activated total T lymphocytes Lymphocyte function was suppressed in the methadone group with poor responses to pokeweed mitogen and phytohemagglutinin in culture Moreover NKcell cytotoxicity was significantly reduced in the methadone group None of these immunologic differences were attributable to HTLV serostatus CONCLUSION The immune abnormalities seen suggest that a clinically significant degree of immune impairment exists in methadonetreated intravenous drug users However these abnormalities could not be explained by the presence of other retroviruses in this HIV1negative study group as there was no significant difference in immune function when HTLVseropositive patients were compared to HTLVseronegative subjects treated with methadone
R784	Herpes simplex virus 1 contains seven genes that are necessary and sufficient for origindependent DNA synthesis in cultured cells We have expressed the product of one of these genes UL9 in insect cells by using a baculovirus expression vector The apparent size of the UL9 protein both in insect cells and in herpes simplex virusinfected Vero cells is 82000 Da By using an immunoassay for proteinDNA interaction we have shown that UL9 protein binds specifically to the herpes simplex virus origins of DNA replication oriS and oriL DNase I footprint analysis has shown that the UL9 protein interacts with two related sites on oriS located on each arm of a nearly perfect palindrome Our data strongly suggest that the originbinding activity described previously by Elias et al Elias P ODonnell M E Mocarski E S  Lehman I R 1986 Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 83 63226326 is the product of the UL9 gene
R785	Hyperpigmentation pulmonary infiltration and erythema nodosum occurred in a patient receiving longterm minocycline therapy Bronchoalveolar lavage revealed both a neutrophilic and an eosinophilic alveolitis The pulmonary and systemic symptoms promptly resolved after discontinuation of minocycline
R786	An enzyme immunoassay was set up with the aim of determining the serum levels of Mullerian inhibiting substance MIS during childhood A monoclonal antibody against purified bovine MIS was combined with a polyclonal antibody against recombinant human MIS to make a sandwich assay This assay detected MIS in human serum within the following criteria Ninetyeight boys aged between birth and 18 yr who had been admitted to the Royal Childrens Hospital were included MIS levels were measured in samples taken for biochemical screening of unrelated disorders MIS was detected in the serum up to 16 yr of age but was low beyond 12 yr and undetectable at 18 yr High MIS levels were found at 412 months consistent with MIS having an important function at this time Germ cells undergo an important transformation from gonocytes to spermatogonia at the same time as the MIS levels peak suggesting a possible function for MIS
R787	Fifteen consecutive patients with metastatic carcinoma who demonstrated bilateral adrenal metastasis on abdominal computed tomography CT were evaluated by the cosyntropin challenge test Primary sites of tumors included lung ten colon two gastric one ovarian one and unknown primary one Bilateral adrenal enlargement was defined as greater than 1 cm on CT scan Adrenal insufficiency was defined as a failure to increase serum cortisol by at least 5 micrograms100 ml to a minimum of 15 micrograms100 ml at either 30 or 60 minutes postcosyntropin No patient had previously been on corticosteroids All patients were questioned and examined for symptomssigns of adrenal insufficiency Five patients 33 were found to have adrenal insufficiency based on the cosyntropin test Of the clinical parameters evaluated all five patients had nausea anorexia and orthostatic hypotension The clinical onset of adrenal insufficiency was insidious no patient experienced acute adrenal crisis We conclude that adrenal insufficiency is not a rare occurrence in patients with metastatic cancer and bilateral adrenal involvement on CT scan
R788	A three step method using microwave irradiation enabled microscopic slides of human brain tissue to be obtained within one working day steps 1 and 2 hardened and solidified brain tissue step 3 completed formalin fixation The efficacy and precision of the method was compared with slides of conventionally processed brain tissue that had been fixed in formalin for six weeks The microscopic quality of the sections was excellent with good presentation of brain tissue and equalled that of conventionally processed slides
R789	Renal allografts are subject to many vascular complications Over a 2year period 334 duplex Doppler ultrasonographic US examinations were performed in 88 renal allograft recipients Vascular occlusion on the basis of severe vascular rejection was documented in ten patients 114 for a sensitivity and specificity of 100 Seven patients for whom there was clinical and Doppler US evidence for renal artery stenosis underwent angiography A significant stenosis was confirmed and treated by angioplasty in four patients one had an insignificant stenosis in an accessory artery one had kinking of the renal vessels and another had normal findings The most reliable criteria for stenosis were a highvelocity jet exceeding 75 kHz and distal turbulence One arteriovenous fistula was diagnosed by the presence of an intrarenal highvelocity jet Duplex Doppler US is a useful noninvasive and portable initial procedure with which to screen patients for vascular complications of renal transplantation
R790	The effects of pharmacologic modulation of vagal activity on ischemic ventricular tachycardia were evaluated in 21 conscious dogs after permanent left anterior descending coronary artery LAD occlusion Studies were done on spontaneous ventricular tachycardia cycle length 383  100 msec n  21 24 to 72 hours after LAD occlusion and on inducible sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia cycle length 251  30 msec n  6 4 to 7 days after LAD occlusion Edrophonium 1 mgkg intravenously a cholinesterase inhibitor and methacholine 01 to 1 mg intravenously a muscarinic agonist had no significant effect on the rate or QRS morphology of either type of tachycardia despite severe slowing of the sinoatrial rate Similarly atropine up to 60 microgramskg intravenously had no effect on the rate and QRS morphology of either type of tachycardia In an attempt to enhance myocardial drug delivery to the ischemic and infarcted left ventricle edrophonium 1 mgkg and methacholine 01 to 02 mg were injected retrogradely through the great cardiac vein This did not impart any significant therapeutic advantage over the systemic intravenous route Sympathetic beta blockade did not affect the therapeutic outcome n  5 with either edrophonium or methacholine It is concluded that direct or indirect enhancement of cardiac vagal activity has no effect on ischemic ventricular tachycardia in this model of subacute myocardial infarction The lack of efficacy appears to be independent of myocardial drug delivery to ischemic ventricular sites and background sympathetic activity Such a lack of efficacy may be caused by ischemiamediated degeneration of vagal nerve terminals by altered responsiveness of muscarinic receptors at infarcted arrhythmogenic myocardial sites or both
R791	A surgical technique designed for safe and easy access to the popliteal vessels resection of a large segment of the tibia and knee joint and a method of patellarextensor mechanism reconstruction and softtissue coverage that utilizes a transferred medial gastrocnemius muscle is reported Eleven patients have been treated with this technique including seven patients with a minimum followup evaluation of two years average 495 months range 246844 months There were five males and two females with an average age of 287 years The histologic diagnoses were osteosarcoma four patients malignant fibrous histiocytoma one patient chondrosarcoma one patient and poorly differentiated sarcoma one patient The surgical stages were Stage IIA one patient and IIB six patients Six intraarticular resections and one extraarticular resection were performed all were classified as wide excisions Four prosthetic replacements and three arthrodeses were performed Pathological specimens showed meniscal and patellar tendon involvement in two patients and pericapsular tibiofibular joint involvement in six patients Local complications were transient peroneal nerve palsy in four patients and superficial skin slough in one patient All resections obtained negative margins and there was no local recurrence or metastatic disease Functional results Musculoskeletal Tumor Society System classification were excellent in one patient good in four fair in one and poor in one Limbsparing surgery for highgrade tumors of the proximal tibia is recommended for carefully selected patients
R792	Six independently maintained sublines of FLEB 14 a fetalliverderived EpsteinBarr virustransformed proB cell line that has not yet rearranged its immunoglobulin genes were examined after in vitro propagation during 1936 months Two lines showed no immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement whereas one allele was rearranged with breakpoints inside the switch region of the mu chain gene in the remaining four These rearrangements had been generated by the translocation of different chromosome fragments to the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene clustercarrying 14q32 band in each of the four lines Previously a similar rearrangement was found in a fifth subline concurrently with a reciprocal 614 translocation The transposed pieces have been derived from chromosomes 16 and 18 in two of the more recently rearranged lines Their origins could not be determined in the remaining two lines but they were different from each other and the other three 14q markers The 14q markercarrying variant has replaced its diploid progenitor suggesting that the translocation has conveyed some in vitro growth advantage on its carrier This was also supported by the duplication of the 14q marker and the loss of its normal chromosome 14 homologue in one subline during serial culturing The vulnerability of the switch region of the mu chain gene to illegitimate recombination at the proB stage and the possible relevance of this finding for the origin of the Burkitt lymphomaassociated 814 immunoglobulin heavy chain gene clusterMYC translocation is discussed
R793	OBJECTIVETo compare the prevalence of silent myocardial ischaemia associated with coronary artery disease in diabetic subjects with that in controls of similar age and sex DESIGNA controlled study in which subjects with positive findings on exercise electrocardiography 24 hour electrocardiographic recording or dynamic thallium scintigraphy diabetics only underwent coronary angiography SETTINGAcademic medical centre referral based cardiology clinic SUBJECTS136 Diabetic subjects of whom 72 33 women 39 men mean age 460 were insulin dependent and 64 19 women 45 men mean age 493 noninsulin dependent 80 Controls matched for age and sex all were clients of the Occupational Health Service of Oulu University Central Hospital or the State Occupational Health Service Station in Oulu in whom diabetes had been excluded by a glucose tolerance test INTERVENTIONSAny subject showing signs of myocardial ischaemia was referred for cardiac catheterization MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESExercise electrocardiography and 24 hour electrocardiographic recording were regarded as positive if there were ST depressions of greater than or equal to 1 mm that were planar or downsloping and persisted for 008 seconds after the J point Thallium tomographic imaging With cardiac catheterisation coronary artery lesions were classified as significant in half or more of the vessel lumen was narrowed or insignificant if such narrowing was less than half RESULTS40 29 diabetes and four 5 controls had positive results in one or more of the noninvasive tests Coronary angiography was performed on 34 of the diabetics six refused 12 had significant coronary artery narrowing seven had unimportant atherosclerosis 15 had patent coronary arteries Among the controls only one had unimportant atherosclerosis the other three had patent arteries CONCLUSIONSThese results confirm the high prevalence of asymptomatic myocardial ischaemia in diabetics Noninvasive screening of diabetic subjects however does not seem justified because of the low preset probability of the presence of the disease and the inaccuracy of the available test methods
R794	In summary paramedics face many hazards in delivering emergency care to children in the field They must be aware of many legal issues in order to avoid litigation proceedings They must know when to deliver care and when to withhold it and they must of course know how to properly administer care to children Better training and more pediatric equipment will certainly help reduce problems here Finally paramedics must carefully document their actions
R795	Establishing appropriate recommendations for protein intake in the management of diabetes requires examination of the role that dietary protein plays in overall health in the control of diabetes and in the risks to health posed by diabetes Achieving metabolic control and delaying andor preventing diabetic complications have previously been established as primary goals for the dietary management of diabetes Although the primary function of dietary protein is for growth and tissue maintenance dietary protein may play a role in the regulation of glucose metabolism and in the development of diabetic renal complications Approximately half of protein intake is considered to be available as glucose Dietary composition also affects secretion of insulin and counterregulatory hormones Onethird of individuals with insulindependent diabetes and onefifth of those with noninsulindependent diabetes develop nephropathy within 15 yr after the diagnosis of diabetes High protein intake and hyperglycemia can increase the glomerular filtration rate and the work load of the kidney There is growing evidence from clinical studies that the progression of renal disease is delayed by early protein restriction More studies are needed to assess early risk of diabetic nephropathy and to determine whether protein restriction alters the course of diabetic nephropathy A dietary intake of between 12 and 20 protein provides flexibility in food selection but exceeds actual needs The adult Recommended Dietary Allowance of 08 gkg body wt should provide guidance for determining desired protein intake for individuals with diabetes
R796	We administered the anticancer drug 5fluorouracil locally to treat rectal adenomas in four patients with familial adenomatous polyposis who had undergone total colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis The drug was administered either in suppository form or in high concentration as a rectal enema One patient was treated successfully with 5fluorouracil suppositories without any side effects but the suppository regimen had to be stopped in three other patients because of severe rectal urgency However one of these patients was treated effectively with rectal administration of a highdose 5fluorouracil solution Adenomas near the anastomotic site or dentate line were difficult to treat Although severe urgency was seen in most patients we think that the intraluminal administration of anticancer agents may prove effective in treating polyposis of the rectum retained after colectomy in familial polyposis It deserves further study
R797	Until the development of ultrasonic duplex scanning the only diagnostic test that was able to study vascular disease wherever it occurred was angiography Duplex scanning found its initial place for the evaluation of the carotid bifurcation With improvements in technology a range of transmitting frequencies better transducers and computer assisted algorithms the application of this method has been greatly extended We now have the capability of evaluating every major vascular bed of interest to the vascular surgeon For the first time we can now both screen and follow patients without resorting to angiography
R798	Of 163 new consecutively diagnosed cases of advanced T34 M0 or T04M1 prostatic cancer 13 had contraindications for estrogen treatment and the remainder were randomized to orchiectomy 76 or to estrogen treatment 74 consisting of 150 micrograms ethinyl estradiol daily and 80 mg polyestradiol monthly During the followup period of 7 to 10 years disease progression was noted in 27 patients 36 treated with estrogen and 39 51 orchiectomized patients The free of progression survival rate was significantly better less than 005 among the estrogen treated patients but the overall survival rates after orchiectomy and estrogen treatment were almost identical A significantly higher frequency of cardiovascular side effects was noted in the estrogen group 23 cases compared to the orchiectomy group 4 cases Therefore estrogen treatment in this form cannot be recommended for the palliative treatment of prostate cancer
R799	A mathematic model of unilateral iliac vein obstruction was used to establish the theoretic basis for selecting saphenous vein or a larger diameter prosthetic crossfemoral venous bypass graft for relief of obstructive venous hypertension Common femoral vein resting and postexercise peak flows and common femoral vein and saphenous vein diameters were measured in 18 healthy individuals and used to estimate the pressure gradient dP across 20 cm long crossfemoral venous bypass grafts of saphenous vein or 4 6 8 10 and 12 mm prosthetic conduits in the presence of a transpelvic venous collateral network of varied cross section The upper limits of normal for the gradients in our model dPstd were set at 4 mm Hg for resting flows and 6 mm Hg after exercise Mean saphenous vein diameter was 43  022 mm which was 365  173 of common femoral vein diameter When the saphenous veins of two thirds of the individuals in our study were used as theoretic crossfemoral venous bypass conduits greater than 80 of postobstruction peak crossfemoral venous bypass graft flow had to be carried by collaterals to maintain a gradient less than or equal to dPstd We demonstrated that 45 to 60 mm diameter saphenous crossfemoral venous bypass grafts would be hemodynamically efficacious in relieving venous hypertension but only when implanted in parallel with an existing venous collateral network that limited the preoperative dP to 45 to 75 mm Hg at resting flows and 70 to 115 mm Hg after exercise only 44 of saphenous veins were adequate for crossfemoral venous bypass grafts by these criteriaABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R800	Research support training and methods in diagnostic radiology have been the focus of analysis for 2 decades and continue to be important in the effective competition for research grants especially those granted by the National Institutes of Health The limitation of hypothesis formation and testing to imaging methods alone however could be a major impediment to more successful sponsorship of research in this discipline The author emphasizes that a welldesigned research plan in diagnostic radiology should not be restricted solely to imaging methods and should include such factors as the formation of welldefined hypotheses testable by means of inductive reasoning and most important flexibility in approaches to research methods Other factors influencing effective research in diagnostic imaging include the establishment of mentors for continuous training and support uninterrupted time for research and a totally supportive environment Improvements in these areas may enhance the competitiveness of research proposals from departments of diagnostic radiology
R801	We present our surgical experience with second operations in 15 patients with recurrent intractable partial seizures after resection for epilepsy The interval from the first operation until the first recurrence of seizures ranged from 1 day to 7 months mean 62 days The interval between the first and second operations ranged from 3 months to 12 years mean 38 months Detailed videoelectroencephalographic interictal and ictal recording was performed in all patients invasive electrodes were used in 11 patients Ictal onset was shown to be remote from the zone of previous resection in 3 of 15 cases all 3 extratemporal and in the ipsilateral hemisphere Recurrent seizures arose from the area of previous extratemporal resection in 2 of 15 patients and from the area of previous temporal resection in 10 of 15 patients Both cases of extratemporal recurrences and 3 of the 10 cases of temporal lobe recurrences in the area of previous resection were associated with residual unresected structural lesion Of the 10 patients with local temporal recurrence 6 had proven epileptogenicity in the residual mesial structures and 4 had residual epileptogenicity in the unresected lateral temporal lobe The patients have been monitored for 8 to 82 months mean 18 months after the second operation 7 patients 47 have remained seizurefree and another 5 33 have achieved a reduction in seizure frequency of more than 90 There was no mortality or significant morbidity in this series We conclude that the extent and distribution of residual epileptogenicity after failed epilepsy surgery are highly variableABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R802	Early studies employing biophysical techniques provided a model for ADHinduced water flow in which the number of small waterconducting channels in the outer facing membrane is increased by the hormone With the development of new concepts and techniques in cell biology the problem of ADH action now centers on organelle movement fusion endocytosis and vesicular traffic with the cell In this review endocytosis and vesicular traffic are discussed and their application to the action of ADH is considered
R803	In this article abnormalities in the proliferation and differentiation of gastrointestinal cells are described in diseases that increase predisposition to gastrointestinal cancer Recent findings related to the effects of calcium on gastrointestinal cell proliferation differentiation and tumor occurrence in rodent models and in human subjects are summarized
R804	During a recent oneyear period 44 clinical centers in the United States saw 2539 patients with diagnoses of pulmonary embolism as supported by high probability lung scans andor positive pulmonary angiograms In developing proposals for a clinical trial of Thrombolysis in Pulmonary Embolism TIPE investigators in the 44 clinical centers reviewed the 2539 patients medical charts for contraindications to thrombolytic therapy Overall 1345 535 patients surveyed in the TIPE clinical centers would have been acceptable for treatment with thrombolytic therapy a proportion higher than generally anticipated Risks of major blood loss were the most frequent contraindications to thrombolytic therapy and were found in 838 333 patients Risks to the CNS were found to contraindicate thrombolytic therapy in 453 179 patients Risks of bleeding into special compartments were found to contraindicate thrombolytic therapy in 76 30 patients Pulmonary embolism is underdiagnosed in most clinical settings and even more patients than found in the TIPE survey could benefit from appropriate diagnosis and treatment The question remains as to whether pulmonary embolism patients will benefit from thrombolytic therapy Only a randomized clinical trial will provide a satisfactory answer
R805	A mechanism for monocrotalineinduced pulmonary hypertension in experimental animals may be the loss of small blood vessels but when pulmonary arteries have been studied the results have been controversial In this report the density of the entire lung microvasculature as measured by grayscale analysis of scanning electron microscopic images of corrosion casts is reported In the first experiment monocrotaline 60 mgkg was injected intraperitoneally into SpragueDawley rats After 16 days the pulmonary vascular tree was cast with methylmethacrylate The vascular density index of the casts at a magnification x 100 on the alveolar surface was 040 for the monocrotalinetreated animals and 048 for the salinetreated control animals p less than 001 On the pleural surface it was 051 for the monocrotaline animals and 067 for the saline animals p less than 0001 A second experiment found no significant difference in vascular density index between different doses of monocrotaline Light and scanning electron microscopy suggest that capillary and small vessel thrombosis may account for the decrease in the density of vessels in pulmonary microvascular casts that occurs in response to monocrotaline
R806	Binding of lactogenic hormones to particulate and solubilized microsomal membranes isolated from mammary glands of lactating mice is inhibited by direct addition of 1010 M or greater concentrations of triphenylethylene antiestrogens ie tamoxifen TAM 4hydroxytamoxifen and Nafoxidine to the binding assays Estradiol and other antiestrogens such as BPEA 24tertbutylphenoxy ethyl diethylamine hydrochloride LY117018 and LY 156758 do not have this effect The triphenylethylene antiestrogens bind to the membraneassociated antiestrogen binding sites AEBS Effectiveness of binding to the AEBS parallels the effectiveness of inhibition of the lactogen binding The effect is selective in that binding of epidermal growth factor and insulin to these same membranes is unaffected by the antiestrogens Binding of PRL to membranes prepared from the livers of the lactating mice is also unaffected Both the PRL receptor and AEBS are primarily localized to the microsomal membrane fraction of cells Maximal inhibition of PRL binding by TAM is observed in the light microsomes that contain plasma membranes In addition to inhibition of PRL binding TAM also prevents the PRLinduced accumulation of caseins by cultured mouse mammary explants Thus it appears that the triphenylethylene antiestrogens acting through the AEBS act as antilactogens in the normal mammary gland
R807	This retrospective study examined the common notion that neurolepticinduced dystonia is less frequent in elderly patients The hospital records of 45 young patients and 45 elderly patients were reviewed Thirtyone percent of the young patients developed dystonia compared to 2 of the elderly patients This significant difference did not appear to be the result of types of neuroleptics used dose or concomitant administration of anticholinergic drugs
R808	All physicians involved with the diagnosis and management of patients with tumors in the temporal bone and cerebellopontine angle are faced with the challenge removing these tumors while preserving hearing Part of the challenge is to make the diagnosis while the tumor is still small enough to attempt a hearingconservation surgical approach Aircontrast air cisternography computed tomography is the gold standard by which all techniques of diagnosis are compared Most physicians however are reluctant to use this test as a screen for tumors because of the associated morbidity time and expense We present three case reports of contrastenhanced magnetic resonance imaging for the detection of small intracanalicular or cerebellopontine angle tumors and review the literature of this new and exciting technology We feel that gadoliniumenhanced magnetic resonance imaging is now the procedure of choice for evaluating patients with suspected temporal bone tumors
R809	To determine whether glycosylated human PRL GhPRL is a circulating form of hPRL serum samples obtained from normal men and women were studied The PRL was immunoprecipitated from 100microL aliquots of serum and the precipitates were subjected to gel electrophoresis in the presence of sodium dodecyl sulfate electrotransferred to nitrocellulose paper immunoblotted with antihPRL serum and 125IproteinA and autoradiographed The autoradiographs showed an intensely stained GhPRL band with a mol wt of 25K in almost all samples studied The nonglycosylated PRL hPRL band with a mol wt of 23K was much more variable in staining intensity from individual to individual Some samples also had a 27K glycosylated immunoreactive PRL band Serum samples were also obtained every other day from two women throughout a 28day period again each sample had an intensely stained GhPRL band and a hPRL band that varied in staining intensity from day to day In contrast however to the GhPRLhPRL pattern in serum samples obtained from normal women and men samples from pregnant women at the onset of spontaneous labor showed opposite results that is an intensely stained hPRL band but only a faintly stained GhPRL band These results indicate that GhPRL is an important component of circulating PRL in normal men and women and that it may vary in amount in certain physiologic states
R810	Infection with Toxoplasma gondii has become a major cause of morbidity in patients with AIDS To investigate the mechanisms responsible for immune responses to toxoplasma Ag we used a highly purified membrane protein P30 of T gondii to stimulate an in vitro Agspecific cytotoxic T cell response P30 immune mouse splenocytes reduced extracellular T gondii plaqueforming units by more than 50 when incubated at an ET ratio of 101 or greater By using a 3Huracil radioisotope release assay the effect of the immune splenocytes was determined to be a direct parasite lytic mechanism The immune splenocytes were P30 Ag specific and of the Thy 12 Lyt23 CD4 CD8 phenotype specific for mouse cytotoxic T cells Opsonization of the parasites with monoclonal P30reactive mAb did not enhance parasiticidal activity Culture supernatants obtained during the 2h cytotoxic assay were not parasiticidal and antiasialoGM1 antibody plus C did not destroy the parasiticidal activity of the P30 responder cells Accordingly we have identified an Agspecific subset of CD4 CD8 P30 responder T cells that are directly parasiticidal to extracellular T gondii and that exhibit cytotoxicity independent of antibody opsonization lymphokine secretion NK cell activity and apparently MHC involvement as well
R811	Ninetyeight patients with acute myocardial infarction were examined by 3 clinicians who independently of each other gave an estimate of left ventricular LV and right ventricular RV ejection fraction EF in each patient Their estimates were based on physical examination chest xray electrocardiogram patient history and clinical course during admission Ejection fractions were estimated as belonging to 1 of 4 categories normal LVEF greater than or equal to 053 RVEF greater than or equal to 057 mildly reduced LVEF 040 to 052 RVEF 045 to 056 moderately reduced LVEF 030 to 039 RVEF 035 to 044 or severely reduced LVEF less than 030 RVEF less than 035 Radionuclide ventriculography was carried out immediately after the physical examination LVEF was correctly estimated in 43 of all examinations deviated from radionuclide LVEF by 1 LVEF category in 45 and by 2 LVEF categories in 12 The 3 clinicians agreed on estimated LVEF in only 32 of the patients RVEF was correctly estimated in 67 of the examinations but none of the clinicians identified greater than 43 of the relatively few patients with reduced radionuclide RVEF and they greatly disagreed as to who among the patients had a reduced RVEF Previous myocardial infarction electrocardiographic infarct location Killip class physical signs of left and rightsided heart failure radiographic pulmonary congestion and cardiomegaly were analyzed to determine which were the most helpful in predicting LVEF and RVEF The results disclosed that several variables traditionally believed to be reliable indexes of reduced ventricular function were surprisingly poor predictors of LVEF and RVEF
R812	Preliminary work suggested that insulin affects preimplantation mouse embryos We investigated the effects of insulin on incorporation of 3Hleucine by embryos cultured for long greater than 24 h or short 4 h terms with insulin Insulin stimulated incorporation by compacted 8cell embryos blastocysts and expanded blastocysts The stimulation in blastocysts had an EC50 of 05 pM in the presence of 1 gL BSA and was blocked by antihuman insulin antiserum Inclusion of insulin in the medium elevated the levels of incorporation towards those of embryos developing in vivo The stimulation was not observed in uncompacted 8cell embryos The ontogeny of stimulation at compaction coincides with a switch in energy dependence from lactate and pyruvate to glucose and an increase in protein synthetic activity
R813	With Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI it is possible to monitor the changes in water content of the nucleus pulposus after intradiscal injection of chymopapain In this prospective study the changes that occurred in 20 patients undergoing singlelevel chemonucleolysis were monitored A constant pattern of gradual reduction of nuclear signal was seen in all cases Complete loss of signal took at least 6 weeks and corresponded to the maximum reduction in disc space height Seventeen patients were scanned at more than 1 year after treatment Of these 13 had been treated by chemonucleolysis alone No significant return of signal from the nucleus pulposus was noted despite a slight reconstitution in disc space height Chymopapain produced irreversible changes analogous to gross premature disc degeneration No similar changes were noted in a control group of 12 patients 31 discs undergoing diagnostic discography without injection of the enzyme
R814	Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of death from malignant disease in Western society Apart from the fortunate few patients who present with a resectable small pancreatic adenocarcinoma conventional treatment offers no hope of cure and has little palliative value Over the past two decades major steps have been made in our understanding of the biology of pancreatic growth and neoplasia This review sets out to explore these advances firstly in the regulation of normal pancreatic growth and secondly the mechanism which may be involved in malignant change of the exocrine pancreas From an understanding of this new biology new treatment strategies may be possible for patients with pancreatic cancer
R815	The position of an armored endotracheal tube was misinterpreted on radiographs This occurred because no one recognized that there was no radiopaque line extending to the tip of the catheter Physicians should be aware of this possible pitfall and manufacturers should remedy the situation by marking such lines on these tubes
R816	Desmopressin appears to be a safe and effective hemostatic agent for use during surgery in patients with mild to moderate hemophilia or von Willebrand disease Uremic patients also benefit from substitution of desmopressin for cryoprecipitate to control bleeding The highly variable response to desmopressin by individual patients with hemophilia or von Willebrand disease dictates that each patient receive a trial administration prior to surgery surgery should proceed only following verification of a therapeutically effective increase in Factor VIII and vWF after desmopressin Use of desmopressin in patients with normal baseline hemostatic function is not clearly advantageous although certain patient subgroups might benefit and prospective studies have documented the drugs safety in these cases Data are lacking to clarify a role for desmopressin during surgery in patients taking aspirin Antifibrinolytic therapy appears to decrease bleeding without increased risk after cardiac surgery In addition specific use after urological surgery may be beneficial in the absence of upper urinary tract bleeding In the last ten years other applications for antifibrinolytic therapy have been foundboth surgical intracranial aneurysms oral and lacrimal surgery and nonsurgical in cancer patients and for gastrointestinal bleeding Although anecdotal reports have fueled fears of increased thrombosis with antifibrinolytics controlled studies indicate no increased risk
R817	Centripetal fat deposition is a wellrecognized consequence of excessive use of corticosteroids either endogenous or exogenous Recently several patients receiving large doses of corticosteroids have suffered compressive myelopathies due to excessive epidural fat collections labeled epidural lipomatosis Two of these have been children and a third child is reported here This child was receiving chronic steroids for juvenile rheumatoid arthritis when he presented with such a myelopathy which was confirmed by metrizamide computerized tomography myelography as well as by surgical exploration Histological examination revealed that the epidural tissue was a brownfat tumor or hibernoma An epidural hibernoma has not been described previously The histological and endocrine features of fat in Cushings syndrome are discussed and the literature concerning hibernoma and epidural lipomatosis is reviewed
R818	Although noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus NIDDM is well recognized to be an inherited disease the genetic lesion responsible remains to be determined Several pedigrees have been reported in which defects of the insulin gene result in glucose intolerance or diabetes in affected members but the role of insulin gene mutations in NIDDM is unknown To evaluate this role we ascertained 23 Caucasian pedigrees for a diabetic individual with at least one diabetic family member sampled the unaffected individuals by a 75g glucose tolerance test and prepared leukocyte DNA on all family members Included in the pedigrees ascertained were those with both predominantly lean and predominantly obese diabetic members and four pedigrees included as insulindependent diabetic individual Insulin gene involvement was evaluated via previously described restrictionfragmentlength polymorphisms RFLPs for the insulin gene and the nearby cHaRas oncogene HRAS Combination of these RFLPs resulted in the ability to trace the insulin alleles in all pedigrees studied Analysis of individual pedigrees for sharing of insulin alleles was possible in 12 pedigrees and lack of linkage was demonstrated in 6 of them Neither linkage nor lack of linkage could be proved in the remaining pedigrees Analysis of the pooled pedigree data failed to demonstrate linkage under several models including autosomaldominant and recessive inheritance with different sporadic frequencies of diabetes and different prevalence figures These results show that mutations of the insulin gene and the immediately surrounding area including regulatory regions of the insulin gene are unlikely to account for a significant subset of NIDDM in Caucasian individuals
R819	For nearly 50 years nerve agents have constituted a serious threat that has stimulated extensive efforts to develop effective medical countermeasures Recent progress in producing pharmacologic defenses suggests that humans can be largely protected from the lethal and prolonged incapacitating effects of these compounds on a chemical battlefield Current research on new approaches to binding and inactivating nerve agents may further decrease their potential as a threat against protected persons
R820	Among 446 sera from prostitutes in Nairobi the prevalence of antibody to human immunodeficiency virus HIV rose from 4 in 1981 to 61 in 1985 None of 118 men with chancroid seen in 1980 had antibody to HIV compared with 15 of 107 such men in 1985 Among pregnant women 20 were seropositive in 1985 versus none of 111 in 1981 Seropositive prostitutes and women with sexually transmitted diseases STDs tended to have more sex partners and had a higher prevalence of gonorrhoea and in women with STDs significantly more seropositive women practiced prostitution Pregnant women and men with STDs who were born in the mostwestern region of Kenya were more likely to have antibody to HIV than were such groups from other geographic areas Our results indicate that the AIDS virus was recently introduced into Kenya that HIV can rapidly disseminate in a highrisk group of heterosexuals and that prostitutes may have significantly contributed to the spread of the virus
R821	Cytomegalovirus herpes simplex and herpes zoster are responsible for the majority of cases of viral retinitis Herpes zoster also has been strongly incriminated as a causal agent in acute retinal necrosis Effective chemotherapy exists for retinitis caused by herpes simplex and herpes zoster along with acute retinal necrosis Conventional antiviral therapy and immunomodulators are ineffective in the treatment of cytomegalovirus retinitis in patients with acquired immune deficiency disorder Ganciclovir a new antiviral agent has significantly reduced visual morbidity in these patients Recurrence of the infection is not uncommon while patients are on the drug or when the agent is discontinued because ganciclovir is virostatic and does not stop viral replication in the retina The inability to control this viral retinitis using presently available chemotherapy indicates a need to examine other therapeutic modalities
R822	An inherited disease associated with deficiencies of betagalactosidase and alphaneuraminidase has been identified recently in sheep The clinical signs the deficiency of lysosomal enzymes and the familial nature of the disorder suggested that the condition was a lysosomal storage disease Four affected sheep were necropsied and their tissues were examined by histopathologic and histochemical methods to determine if the lesions were consistent with a lysosomal storage disease Central nervous system neurons were enlarged with finely to coarsely granular cytoplasmic material or less often neurons were distended with multiple variablysized vacuoles Loss of neurons without gliosis was evident and the Nissl substance was either dispersed and fragmented or condensed around the nuclei of remaining neurons Neurons of intestinal and other peripheral ganglia retinal ganglion cells and heart Purkinje fibers were enlarged similarly White matter of the cerebrum and spinal cord had numerous spheroid to ellipsoid axonal enlargements Periportal hepatocytes and renal epithelial cells were enlarged with marked vacuolation The neuronal storage material stained intensely with periodic acidSchiffalcian blue with Luxol fast blue for acid phosphatase and moderately with oil red O stains Renal and hepatocyte storage material stained intensely with oil red O and moderately with periodic acidSchiffalcian blue and Sudan black B stains The lesions in these sheep were consistent with those of a lysosomal storage disease Both neuronal and visceral storage occurred but the neuronal storage was more severe
R823	The HLAAw19 complex consists of a number of serologically crossreactive Ag ie A29 A30 A31 A32 and Aw33 which exhibit an epitope shared by HLAB and C proteins To investigate the structural basis for these serologic crossreactivities we have cloned and determined the nucleotide sequences for A30 A31 and Aw33 and compared the predicted amino acid sequences with those already available for A29 A32 and other class I allelic products All alleles of the Aw19 group contained Alocusspecific sequences exhibiting Aness The structural similarities between Aw19 polypeptides were found in the alpha 1 and alpha 2 domains where shared amino acid residues were identified that correlated with observed serological reactivity patterns Seven Aw19specific nucleotides were found Two of these were silent substitutions but the remaining five resulted in Aw19specific amino acid residues Each of the HLAA alleles can be classified into one of the five serologically crossreacting groups In the Aw19 group the alleles A29 A31 A32 and Aw33 are closely related serologically as well as genetically whereas A30 probably belongs to the A1A3A11 group The similarity between A30 and the other Aw19 alleles may have resulted from two independent gene conversions affecting exons 2 and 3 Additional mutations or gene conversionlike events in A30 were also noted It is postulated that gene conversions have played a significant role in the divergence of the Aw19 alleles However each serologically crossreactive Aw19 allotype appears to have arisen directly from a common ancestral allele A30 was the only exception and this allele may represent an unusual allotype which is subject to a high rate of genetic changes as is seen in the H2Kb gene of the mouse
R824	Identifying the febrile child at risk for serious illness continues to challenge physicians especially since conflicting guidelines exist for identification and management This situation poses a special problem for the pediatricianintraining In this study the 35 PL1 P12 and PL3 pediatric house staff of a universityaffiliated hospital were surveyed by written questionnaire regarding their practices in dealing with children of less than two years with rectal temperature above 101 degrees F 383 degrees C Uniform replies were received from all house staff concerning the significance of patient age degree of fever and laboratory data although there were some differences of opinion regarding the importance of specific data All three resident levels tended to reduce the number of laboratory tests obtained as patient age increased with emphasis placed on clinical impression of illness in assessing the older febrile child Although the house staff indicated that they were satisfied with their handling of the febrile child the PL3s were only marginally more satisfied than the PL1s and PL2s In general the house staff had most confidence in handling the patient under three months of age for whom it was generally felt that extensive laboratory evaluations and active management were indicated The perception of the need for a formal protocol was also greatest for this youngest age group and decreased in importance with age
R825	We describe 71 cases of oromandibular reconstruction using microvascular composite free flaps There was an overall flap success rate of 94 while 97 of the patients in this series had their mandibles reconstructed with free vascularized bone flaps Fifteen patients were rehabilitated with implantborne dental prostheses Primary repair of discontinuity defects of the inferioralveolar nerve using a variety of nerve grafts was performed in 16 patients A new classification scheme for composite defects of the oral cavity involving bone soft tissue and neurologic defects is proposed and applied in the description of each of the patients in this series
R826	The accuracy reliability and cost effectiveness of 5 currently marketed flow meters have been assessed The mechanics of each meter is briefly described in relation to its accuracy and robustness The merits and faults of the meters are discussed and the important features of flow measurements that need to be taken into account when making diagnostic interpretations are emphasised
R827	A group of 33 patients with the autosomal dominant form of Waardenburg Type II syndrome underwent hearing and vestibular examination A bilateral symmetrical sensorineural hearing loss was found in 51 per cent of the tested subjects The severity of hearing loss varied from mild to severe Strong evidence indicated the possible progressive nature of the hearing loss Concerning the frequency of vestibular findings the study highlights the frequent divergence between cochlear and vestibular involvement
R828	Following percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty wire fragments retained within the patient usually can be removed without an operation We report a case requiring surgical removal of a guidewire fragment from the distal circumflex coronary artery
R829	To determine the factors responsible for ulcerative colitis relapse a cohort of 92 patients 18 to 78 years 50 men with clinically inactive disease have been followed for over 48 weeks At 12 weekly intervals patients were asked by means of standardised questionnaires about infections compliance with maintenance medication new drug treatment dietary changes episodes of nonbloody diarrhoea life stresses and feelings of anxiety and depression Thirty five patients 38 relapsed median interval 17 weeks range three to 46 weeks Patients who relapsed had a higher previous relapse rate than nonrelapsers p less than 0001 and a shorter time from previous relapse to trial entry p less than 005 Other clinical characteristics were equally matched in the two groups Between and within group comparisons revealed that upper respiratory tract symptoms antibiotic ingestion analgesic intake diarrhoeal episodes and stressful life events were no more common in the four weeks before relapse than before routine attendance Anxiety and depression ratings were also similar in the two groups The timing of ulcerative colitis relapse showed a clear seasonal pattern with 26 patients relapsing from August to January and only nine from January to July p less than 0001 In addition a retrospective case note analysis revealed significant seasonality of onset of ulcerative colitis We conclude that seasonal factors may contribute to both onset and relapse of ulcerative colitis
R830	The 1980s have been declared the decade of the disabled Surgeon General Koop has stated that it is profoundly important for our own society that we tend to these issues of disabled children that these children not be forgotten or pushed aside and that we retain our belief in the strength of the American family The field of pediatric rehabilitation unheard of as recently as the late 1970s has become a recognized specialty The definition of pediatric rehabilitation has expanded to include the care and treatment of children with congenital and acquired disabilities The pediatric rehabilitation nurse is challenged to keep abreast of new developments in the field while seeking and implementing innovative ways to assist the child and family in their adjustment to the childs disability A knowledge base of normal growth and development is essential when assessing abnormal patterns in the child with a disability Complete assessment of the child with a disability includes a parentchild interview and physical assessment with particular focus on the childs developmental age movement patterns and functional activities of daily living The reaction of the child and family to the disability is all too often viewed as lack of acceptance of the childs disability A continuum of adjustment to the disability for both family and child describes normal coping mechanisms for living with and managing the needs of a disabled child It is important for the pediatric rehabilitation nurse to develop a partnership with parents in which they serve as consultants to families not as directors of the childs care Cerebral palsy and spina bifida are the two most common childhood disabilities With advanced technologic equipment and refined surgical procedures the childs potential for independence is reaching new heights Computerized technology has aided the motorimpaired child to progress through normal developmental processes of exploration and discovery Specialized health procedures such as tube feedings and clean intermittent catherization have become routine for many children and their families Advanced technology has also benefited the child who is ventilator dependent although not without some limitations to the child family and society Limited financial and psychosocial resources create a burden on both the family and society as the child continues to require high technology care The relatively new field of headinjury rehabilitation provides an arena for pediatric rehabilitation nurses to define specific interventions for the child who is rapidly evolving through the stages of cognitive and motor recoveryABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS
R831	Based on our preliminary studies and the results of this study we conclude that argon laser welding of 48 mm internal diameter veins arteries and arteriovenous fistulas may have several potential advantages compared to conventional suture techniques The benefits of laser repairs may include improved mechanical properties and absence of the foreign body response related to sutures Laser welding is sterile nontactile and possibly time conserving and the wounds heal rapidly without aneurysms or excess tissue proliferation
R832	Macrophages are important target cells for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 HIV1 The ability of HIV1 to productively infect macrophages may be influenced by endogenous cytokines that alter the activation state of these cells In this study the effect of tumor necrosis factoralphacachectin TNF alpha a cytokine with macrophageactivating properties on HIV1 replication in primary blood monocytederived macrophages was examined Treatment of macrophages with recombinant human TNF alpha rTNF alpha starting before or after HIV1 infection consistently enhanced viral production fivefold or greater above control P less than 01 rTNF alpha was active at low concentrations 00550 ngml and increased the replication of both lymphocytetropic human T lymphotropic virus type IIIB and macrophagetropic human T lymphotropic virus type III BaL strains of HIV1 These findings provide additional evidence that TNF alpha may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV1 infection by upregulating viral expression in macrophages
R833	Severe occlusive disease of the carotid artery may produce a rare syndrome of chronic ocular ischemia Prolonged retinal hypoxia is associated with characteristic funduscopic changes and neovascularization of the iris with subsequent obstruction of aqueous humor resorption A case of neovascular glaucoma as a result of severe bilateral carotid occlusive disease and the pathophysiology involved are discussed Definitive treatment consisted of carotid endarterectomy and aggressive control of intraocular pressure including operative placement of a drainage implant in the anterior chamber of the eye Seizure activity and an exacerbation of glaucoma developed after successful revascularization exemplifying the derangements in cerebral and ocular function that may result from chronic hypoperfusion
R834	The localization of vitamin B12 Rbinder in the uterus was studied by use of an immunoperoxidase technique Positive staining by antiRbinder antiserum was observed in the columnar epithelium of the endocervix 1818 cases and in the surface epithelium of the endometrium 821 cases Staining was usually seen in the apical portion of the epithelium cytoplasmic staining in the endocervical columnar epithelium was intense The secretory products in the endocervical glands showed positive staining The endometrial glandular epithelium did not stain 024 cases Metaplastic squamous epithelium of the endocervix showed positive staining 318 cases The native squamous epithelium as well as the stromal components of the cervix endometrium and myometrium were negative for Rbinder This study shows that Rbinder is localized in the uterus especially in the endocervical glands The Rbinder in the endocervix may have antimicrobial activity in the uterus as in other organs such as the intestines and mammary glands
R835	Because phencyclidine intoxication has both psychiatric and physical manifestations it continues to present a challenge to physicians Intoxication may be viewed as occurring in three stages Mild intoxication the first and most common stage is manifested primarily by psychiatric signs and symptoms In the second stage patients are stuporous to comatose but they have intact deep pain responses In the third stage patients do not respond to deep pain stimuli Treatment depends on the stage of intoxication
R836	Specific cellsurface receptors mediate the uptake of plasma proteins into growing oocytes of oviparous species thereby forming yolk Quantitatively the most important yolk precursors are the lipoproteins very low density lipoprotein and vitellogenin We show that a single major chicken oocyte plasma membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 95 kDa as determined by SDSPAGE under nonreducing conditions is the receptor for both of these ligands Binding activities for the two ligands copurified on ligand affinity matrices and were inhibited by the same antibody preparations and the ligands competed with each other for binding to the 95kDa protein In addition to these biochemical and immunological lines of evidence for the identity of the vitellogenin receptor with the very low density lipoprotein receptor genetic proof was obtained We have previously shown that the mutant nonlaying restrictedovulator hen carries a defect in the gene responsible for functional expression of the oocyte 95kDa protein Here we demonstrate that this single gene defect in the restrictedovulator hen has detrimental consequences for the binding not only of very low density lipoprotein but also of vitellogenin to the 95kDa receptor normally present in oocytes The intriguing bifunctionality of this chicken oocyte membrane protein possibly relates to its crucial role in receptormediated control of oocyte growth
R837	Thermal injury causes systemic changes that result in altered sensitivity to many drugs including nondepolarizing muscle relaxants In an effort to identify the mechanisms responsible for the resistance to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants the density of acetylcholine receptors AChR and the activity of acetylcholinesterase AChE were determined in rats following a 30 total body surface thermal injury at a time when resistance to atracurium is maximum AChR density in gastrocnemius and diaphragm was unchanged by thermal injury Furthermore the ratio of junctional to extrajunctional AChR in diaphragm was unaltered Total AChE activity was unchanged in thermally injured rats compared with that in shaminjured animals Separation of the molecular forms of AChE by sucrose gradient centrifugation also showed no changes in the relative proportions of these species The mechanism of resistance to nondepolarizing muscle relaxants does not appear to be explained by changes in AChR number or changes in the activity of AChE
R838	Orthotopic liver transplantation may be associated during the postoperative period with hepatic artery thrombosis a catastrophic occurrence generally necessitating emergency retransplantation To assess the contribution of the coagulation mechanism to this complication the levels of procoagulant and anticoagulant proteins were followed in 41 liver transplant patients during the first 10 postoperative days The mean activities of all procoagulant factors reach normal values on day 1 except for factors V and VII which achieve normal activity by day 3 Supernormal levels of factor VIII activity and antigen are noted peak values on day 5 of 334  113 and 481  260 respectively The anticoagulant proteins show delayed recovery with deficient antithrombin III levels seen in 81 of patients on day 3 and 57 on day 5 Similarly proteins C and S are subnormal in 24 and 21 respectively on day 3 and 20 and 10 respectively on day 5 During this period elevated levels of thrombinantithrombin complexes are encountered reflecting in vivo activation of the coagulation mechanism Activated thrombin is therefore being generated at a time when a decrease in the major regulatory anticoagulant proteins exists These data suggest an imbalance between the hemostatic and thrombotic mechanisms and indicate a sustained prothrombotic state that may contribute to the risk for hepatic artery thrombosis Using a regimen of lowdose heparin and fresh frozen plasma infusion no thromboses have been seen in 65 consecutive liver transplants
R839	Inhaled furosemide prevents bronchoconstriction induced by nebulized distilled water exercise and antigen challenge We examined the effect of furosemide on cough induced by low chloride content solutions and by capsaicin in doubleblind placebocontrolled studies A group of eight nonsmoking normal subjects was given furosemide 375 mgml inhaled for 8 min and placebo saline immediately before consecutive 1min inhalations of four isosmolar solutions with decreasing chloride content every 5 min from an ultrasonic nebulizer Decreasing concentrations of chloride induced doserelated coughing which was inhibited by furosemide Thus chloridefree solution induced 131  16 coughs after placebo and 84  19 coughs after furosemide p less than 0005 In a separate study six of the same normal subjects were given inhaled furosemide or placebo before inhaling one breath of capsaicin solution given in three consecutive increasing concentrations Capsaicin induced doserelated coughing which was not inhibited by furosemide Thus after placebo the highest concentration of capsaicin induced 208  18 coughs and after furosemide 215  27 coughs We conclude that furosemide may act by inhibiting the cough reflex indirectly perhaps by changing local chloride ions within the vicinity of epithelial cough receptors
R840	Insulindependent diabetes mellitus IDDM results from an inflammatory process leading to destruction of the insulinproducing beta cells of the pancreas Genetically mediated autoimmune processes are considered the most likely explanation for IDDM in humans while viral infections toxic agents nutritional alterations and stress are also considered possibilities The precise mechanisms by which autoimmunity infections toxins or other agents produce beta cell damage are not known Toxininduced diabetes in animals can be prevented by antioxidant therapy while an agent that inhibits hydroxyl radical formation desferrioxamine extends the survival time of free allotypic islets in nonobese diabetic mice The BBW rat develops IDDM secondary to a pervasive autoimmune defect This wellstudied animal model develops IDDM with a highly predictable frequency and timing This study describes the effects of the potent antioxidant probucol on the development of diabetes in BB rats by introducing it into standard rat chow at a 1 concentration at the time of weaning and continuing this feeding schedule through 160 days of life Control rats from split litters received standard chow only Diabetes developed in 862 of the control rats at a mean age of 904 days Probucol administration was associated with a reduction to 62 and a delay in diabetes diagnosis to 996 days These very preliminary results suggest that probucol may be altering the inflammatory process resulting in beta cell destruction in these genetically diabetesprone rats
R841	The crystal structure of the binary complex tRNAAspaspartyl tRNA synthetase from yeast was solved with the use of multiple isomorphous replacement to 3 angstrom resolution The dimeric synthetase a member of class II aminoacyl tRNA synthetases aaRSs exhibits the characteristic signature motifs conserved in eight aaRSs These three sequence motifs are contained in the catalytic site domain built around an antiparallel beta sheet and flanked by three alpha helices that form the pocket in which adenosine triphosphate ATP and the CCA end of tRNA bind The tRNAAsp molecule approaches the synthetase from the variable loop side The two major contact areas are with the acceptor end and the anticodon stem and loop In both sites the protein interacts with the tRNA from the major groove side The correlation between aaRS class II and the initial site of aminoacylation at 3OH can be explained by the structure The molecular association leads to the following features i the backbone of the GCCA singlestranded portion of the acceptor end exhibits a regular helical conformation ii the loop between residues 320 and 342 in motif 2 interacts with the acceptor stem in the major groove and is in contact with the discriminator base G and the first base pair UA and iii the anticodon loop undergoes a large conformational change in order to bind the protein The conformation of the tRNA molecule in the complex is dictated more by the interaction with the protein than by its own sequence
R842	From 19821986 seven patients with pathologically confirmed placental site trophoblastic tumors underwent treatment at the New England Trophoblastic Disease Center All seven patients presented with nonmetastatic disease the presenting symptom was vaginal bleeding in six patients and amenorrhea in one patient Mitotic counts of the tumor may vary among endometrial curettings hysterectomy specimens and metastatic lesions When placental site trophoblastic tumor is diagnosed on endometrial curettage a thorough metastatic workup should be undertaken Because of this tumors poor response to chemotherapy a diagnosis of nonmetastatic placental site trophoblastic tumor should be followed by prompt hysterectomy
R843	Asthma morbidity is known to exhibit seasonal periodicity Yet the relationship between trends in morbidity vs mortality is not known This report describes and compares the seasonal variation in asthma hospitalizations and mortality in the US population During 1982 through 1986 both mortality and hospitalizations demonstrated periodic seasonal trends that were age specific and did not differ by sex race or region For persons aged 5 through 34 years hospitalizations peaked in September through November whereas mortality trends peaked in June through August A disproportionate number of the summer deaths in this age group occurred out of the hospital For individuals 65 years old or older both asthma hospitalizations and mortality demonstrated increases during December through February The results of this study demonstrate agespecific seasonal variations in the clinical expression of asthma Perhaps the treatment and prevention of asthma hospitalizations and mortality might be improved through further understanding of these trends
R844	Recently it was shown that under certain conditions there is a linkage between oxygen delivery DO2 and oxygen consumption VO2 so that any increase in DO2 is accompanied by an increase in VO2 We investigated this phenomenon in 10 patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea who had nocturnal oxygen desaturations to less than 85 Group I 10 patients with mild sleep apnea and no significant desaturations Group II and six obese control subjects Group III VO2 was measured by respired gas analysis before and after passive leg raising which has been shown to increase DO2 by 10 to 12 This was verified by thermodilution cardiac output measurements in four obese patients In patients with severe sleep apnea mean apnea index was 53  11 and supine VO2 was 141  40 mlminm2 whereas with leg elevation it rose to 163  41 mlminm2 p less than 0005 In patients with mild sleep apnea and in obese control subjects mean apnea indices of 24  6 and 4  1 respectively supine VO2 was 144  11 and 152  10 mlminm2 respectively with leg elevation VO2 was 144  13 and 151  6 mlminm2 respectively p greater than 06 The study was repeated in nine of the Group I patients after 8 wk of treatment with nasal CPAP Group IA The repeated supine VO2 in these patients was 138  28 mlminm2 and a significant difference was not observed after leg raising 140  29 mlminm2 p greater than 05ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R845	PURPOSE To assess the changes in sodium excretion and sodium balance after initiation of nifedipine treatment and after withdrawal of nifedipine PATIENTS Eight patients with uncomplicated mild to moderate essential hypertension were entered in a singleblind placebocontrolled study of 39 days duration METHODS Two 7day periods while on a fixed sodium intake of 150 mmolday approximately 3 weeks apart After 4 days of a placebo and fixed sodium intake patients were given nifedipine GITS gastrointestinal therapeutic system once a day and carefully studied for the following 4 days Thereafter patients continued to receive nifedipine GITS and approximately 3 weeks later they were studied again for a week while on a fixed sodium intake Nifedipine administration was stopped and changes occurring after withdrawal were studied RESULTS Nifedipine caused a significant increase in sodium excretion with a cumulative loss of sodium of 38 mmol per subject within the first 4 days of treatment The withdrawal of nifedipine treatment caused a significant decrease in sodium excretion and a cumulative retention of sodium of 42 mmol per subject within the first 4 days of withdrawal CONCLUSION Nifedipine causes an acute and a sustained reduction in sodium balance in patients with essential hypertension This prolonged effect may contribute to the mechanism whereby nifedipine lowers blood pressure
R846	There is now a better understanding of the natural history of colorectal cancer which has provided a basis for intervention to influence outcome The possible interventions include earlier detection of colorectal cancer removal of premalignant adenomas demonstration of the mucosal field defect that precedes neoplasia to evaluate baseline risk and its change with dietary modification and identification of inherited and dietary risk factors Five controlled trials evaluating early detection of colorectal cancer with fecal occult blood testing have enrolled more than 309000 patients Early stage cancers with improved survival has been observed but data on mortality reduction have not as yet been reported Studies of patients with adenomas have demonstrated high synchronous and metachronous rates as a basis for complete colon evaluation initially and a surveillance followup program Hyperproliferation and lack of normal differentiation have been observed as a field defect in the colon preceding neoplasia Inherited factors have recently been shown to be important in a larger proportion of individuals destined to develop colorectal adenomas and cancer These observations of the natural history of colorectal cancer have provided new opportunities for the application of radiologic and endoscopic techniques in diagnosis and surveillance each examination has its merit Further research is needed to answer many critical questions that have been raised regarding the impact of these interventions
R847	The deficits in texture motion and depth perception incurred in monkeys at isoluminance were compared with the responses of neurons of the coloropponent and broadband systems in the lateral geniculate nucleus Texture perception assumed to be carried by the coloropponent system and motion and depth perception ascribed to the broadband pathway were all found to be compromised but not abolished at isoluminance Correspondingly both the coloropponent and the broadband systems were affected at isoluminance but the activity of the neurons in neither system was abolished These results suggest that impairment of visual capacities at isoluminance cannot be uniquely attributed to either of these systems and that isoluminant stimuli are inappropriate for the psychophysical isolation of these pathways
R848	Both insulin and phorbol esters rapidly stimulated the cytoplasmic accumulation of a specific mRNA designated p33 in a time and dosedependent manner in serumdeprived rat H4 hepatoma cells When cells were pretreated with phorbol esters to produce a deficiency in protein kinaseC the ability of further phorbol ester addition to stimulate p33 mRNA accumulation was abolished However after pretreatment of H4 cells with phorbol esters insulin still induced cellular p33 mRNA concentrations but to a lesser degree The primary effect of phorbol esters was to increase transcription of the p33 gene and this was abolished after pretreatment with phorbol esters In previous work insulin was shown to stimulate p33 gene transcription but this effect was insufficient to account for the level of insulininduced p33 mRNA production The transcriptional effect of insulin was further reduced by phorbol ester pretreatment Insulin must therefore regulate p33 gene expression by at least two pathways at least one of which may be modulated by protein kinaseC
R849	A simple method to promote the use of human milk and subsequent breast feeding in low birthweight infants was evaluated in 32 babies In the intervention group n  16 mean SD weight 1559 228 g and length of gestation 332 18 weeks infants were allowed to suckle at the breast when their general condition permitted after as much milk as possible had been expressed and were then given the full required feeds by tube Full breast feeding was started as soon as the infant could suck adequately Sixteen control infants mean SD weight 1605 198 g and length of gestation 341 24 weeks were breast fed in the conventional manner only after it had been established that they could suck well until then they received all their feeds by tube After discharge the mean SD periods of exclusive and total breast feeding were longer in the group that had received the intervention 37 13 and 51 22 months respectively than among the controls 19 06 and 33 19 months respectively This intervention method helps to promote milk formation provides sucking experience for low birthweight infants without interfering with their nutritional intake and consequent weight gain and encourages subsequent breast feeding with its well recognised advantages
R850	Ventilationperfusion VAQ inequality has been evaluated using the multiple inert gas technique in nine nonsmoking patients mean  SD age 56  10 yr with stable severe chronic asthma partially reversible airway obstruction baseline FEV1 39  10 predicted before and during 100 O2 breathing and then 15 min after three puffs 300 micrograms of inhaled salbutamol The aim of this study was to investigate whether this type of asthma was associated with a different pattern of VAQ inequality from that observed in acute episodes and in particular to determine whether the VAQ pattern was fixed or could be altered by bronchodilator agents or O2 breathing The predominant pattern of VAQ distribution was broad and unimodal but without shunt VAQ  0 or low VAQ areas VAQ less than 01 to greater than 0005 The amount of VAQ inequality as assessed by the dispersion of the distribution of pulmonary bloodflow log SDQ was not great log SDQ 077  009 and no correlation was found with the degree of airway obstruction PaO2 or AaPO2 During 100 O2 breathing VAQ inequality worsened from log SDQ of 077  009 to 111  021 p  001 with an increase in the perfusion of low VAQ units from 043  066 to 63  65 p  002 but still no development of shunt This suggests the presence of hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction breathing air possibly contributing to the preservation of VAQ relationshipsABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R851	The scintigraphic appearances of 12 surgically proven cases of choledochal cyst were retrospectively reviewed In seven of 12 cases radionuclide accumulated in the choledochal cyst ie the dilated common bile duct in less than 1 hr In three additional cases delayed accumulation 124 hr within the cyst was seen In two of the 12 cases no ductal activity appeared and the diagnosis of choledochal cyst could not be made although in one of these two cases delayed images were not obtained Other frequent findings included delayed or nonvisualization of the gallbladder 11 of 12 and the appearance of prominent intrahepatic ducts five of 12 We conclude that hepatobiliary scintigraphy is a noninvasive test useful in the diagnosis of choledochal cyst

R853	The influence of unilateral vesicoureteric reflux VUR on renal growth and the uptake of 99mTc DMSA by the kidney has been investigated in a 2kidney model in the growing minipig over a period of approximately 5 months Animals with reflux in association with low voiding pressures and normal bladder function n  5 as well as those with raised voiding pressures and abnormal bladder function n  7 were investigated with appropriate nonrefluxing controls n  12 Urinary infection and renal scarring were avoided since these factors may affect kidney function and growth independently Statistical tests of difference failed to demonstrate any effect of VUR on renal growth or renal uptake of 99mTc DMSA even in the presence of elevated voiding pressures and abnormal detrusor function
R854	The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of intraoperative ultrasound monitoring in the reduction and stabilization of thoracolumbar burst fractures of the spine Thirtyone patients underwent a posterior approach for reduction and stabilization of a thoracolumbar burst fracture with complete followup available on 26 Intraoperative realtime sonography was used for monitoring retropulsed fragments during distraction and fracture impaction Computed tomography was used to compare preoperative canal compromise and postoperative reduction Average canal compromise preoperatively was 665 and the average canal compromise postoperatively was 187 Neurologic function was not changed in 16 improved in ten and worsened in none Average hospital stay was 216 days No complications were directly attributable to the use of the ultrasound The authors believe that ultrasonography provides a safe and accurate method of intraoperatively evaluating reduction of burst fracture of the thoracolumbar spine from the posterior approach
R855	We identify and characterize a novel beta 0thalassemia mutation that is associated with an unusually high level of hemoglobin Hb A2 in the heterozygote This newly discovered mutation is caused by a 532basepair deletion that extends from positions 454 to  78 relative to the mRNA cap site of the betaglobin gene The propositi are 9monthold fraternal twins One of the twins is a compound heterozygote for the deletion and Hb S the other is a compound heterozygote for the deletion and Hb C
R856	This study compared cardiacgated equilibrium bloodpool imaging studies using in vitro technetium99m 99mTc labeled red blood cells RBCs prepared with the UltraTag RBC kit to in vivo labeling with stannous pyro and trimeta phosphates The in vitro labeling procedure takes approximately 25 min and does not require centrifugation to separate free from bound 99mTc Imaging studies were performed in 30 patients using the in vitro labeling procedure and in 30 patients with in vivo labeling Regions of interest were placed over the center of the left ventricle inferior and lateral to the left ventricle background and over the right midlung The mean  se in vitro RBC labeling efficiency was 985  02 The hearttobackground ratios were significantly higher with in vitro labeling The hearttobackground ratios averaged among two blinded reviewers were 46 and 34 for the in vitro and in vivo methods respectively The hearttolung ratio was generally higher with the in vitro procedure 36 than that observed with the in vivo method 32 but failed to attain statistical significance p  0059 These results demonstrate the superiority of the in vitro labeling procedure over in vivo labeling for gated equilibrium bloodpool imaging

R859	We hypothesized that the endogenous coronary vasodilator adenosine may reduce infarct size by progressively increasing reflow in a preparation of coronary occlusionreperfusion After 90 min of proximal left anterior descending artery occlusion 20 dogs were randomized to blood reperfusion with n  10 or without n  10 adenosine into the proximal left anterior descending vessel at 375 mgmin for 60 min after reperfusion Regional myocardial blood flow was determined serially with microspheres and regional ventricular function was assessed by a computerized radial shortening method At 24 hr the area at risk was defined in vivo with monastral blue dye and area of necrosis was determined after incubation of left ventricular slices in triphenyltetrazolium chloride Hemodynamic variables were similar in the two groups during the experimental protocol Infarct size was significantly reduced in treated animals both when expressed as a percentage of the area at risk 99  28 vs 409  66 p less than 001 and as a percentage of the left ventricle 46  13 vs 180  34 p  002 This was associated with significant improvement in radial shortening in the ischemic zone 24 hr after reperfusion 101  25 vs 28  22 p less than 01 Regional myocardial blood flow was significantly increased in endocardial and epicardial regions from the lateral ischemic zone 1 hr after reperfusion in adenosinetreated animals Light microscopy demonstrated decreased neutrophil infiltration in the ischemic zone and electron microscopy showed relative preservation of endothelial structure in the subendocardium with reduced neutrophil and red cell stagnation of capillaries in the treated group These findings suggest that intracoronary administration of adenosine after reperfusion significantly reduces infarct size and improves regional ventricular function in the ischemic zone in the canine preparation
R860	To characterize P2purinoceptors in pulmonary vessels we have examined the effects of ATP analogs on rat isolated pulmonary artery and vein in vitro The rank order of potency for causing vasoconstriction was alphabetamethyleneATP alphabetameATP greater than betagammamethyleneATP betagammameATP greater than 2methylthioATP 2mSATP greater than ATP for arteries and alphabetameATP much greater than betagammameATP  2mSATP greater than ATP for veins indicating that a P2x receptor was involved The contractile response to these analogs was virtually abolished after desensitization of P2xreceptors by alphabetameATP Removal of the endothelial cells enhanced the contractile responses to all of the ATP analogs in both arteries and veins The rank order of potency for vasodilatation was 2mSATP much greater than ATP  betagammameATP much greater than alphabetameATP for arteries and 2mSATP much greater than ATP  betagammameATP with alphabetameATP being no effect for veins indicating a P2y receptor Pretreatment of the pulmonary arteries with the P2yantagonist reactive blue 2 caused a rightward shift of the doseresponse curves to 2mSATP ATP and betagammameATP Reactive blue 2 was only used with the pulmonary arteries Removal of the endothelium converted the relaxant responses to all the ATP analogs except to ATP in pulmonary artery to further contraction In the pulmonary artery the small endotheliumindependent relaxation induced by ATP was abolished completely by pretreating the vessels with 100 microM theophylline a P1purinoceptor antagonist suggesting that it was due to conversion of ATP to adenosineABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R861	In an effort to improve hepatic uptake of liposomes for drug delivery empty vesicles were administered by means of selective arterial infusion Negatively charged multilamellar liposomes were labeled with technetium99m and infused into healthy adult dogs Each dog received 100 mgm2 of lipid over 10 minutes at 2 mLmin Liposomes were administered via the common hepatic artery after proximal occlusion of the gastroduodenal artery via the cranial mesenteric artery and via the cephalic vein Distribution liver spleen and lungs was determined by computerassisted external imaging techniques On the average after arterial infusion 692 of the total activity was located in the liver 36 in the spleen 32 in the lungs and 35 in the general circulation Following venous injection 507 of the radioactivity was found in the liver 91 in the spleen 86 in the lungs and 67 in the peripheral blood Once the liposomes entered the systemic circulation they were cleared at the same rate halflife beta  215 hours independent of their route of administration Increased hepatic liposome uptake should translate into higher local and lower systemic liposomal drug levels
R862	Pancreatic duct stents have recently been placed for a variety of acute and chronic pancreatic lesions Although complications have occurred there are no data to suggest that the stents themselves induce ductal changes In a retrospective review of 34 patients having 38 pancreatic duct stents placed for disrupted ducts isolated strictures pancrease divisum and hypertensive pancreatic sphincters 36 of all patients 72 of patients who had normal initial pancreatograms were found to have subsequent ductal changes Such changes were related either to stent occlusion pseudocyst diffuse duct enlargement and direct stent trauma or side branch occlusion irregular stenoses side branch ectasia Whereas the former resolved with stent retrieval or exchange it remains uncertain what the longterm consequences of the latter changes will be despite a tendency for the abnormal pancreatograms to improve with time Further experience is needed with pancreatic stenting before widespread application of this technique
R863	Chronic ethanol consumption results in acetaldehyde adduct formation with proteins such as haemoglobin and liver proteins in vivo Our purpose was to study the binding of acetaldehyde to liver microsomal proteins a site of ethanol oxidation via cytochrome P450 especially P450 II E1 after chronic administration of ethanol or acetaldehyde for 21 days to rats The liver microsomal oxidation of 1butanol by the ethanolinducible P450 also was examined Acetaldehyde bound to liver microsomal proteins was higher in ethanolfed rats compared with acetaldehydetreated rats 0735 vs 0413 nmolmg of protein respectively The biotransformation of nbutanol to butyraldehyde by liver microsomes was increased by 136 in ethanolfed rats vs controls whereas in acetaldehydetreated rats this increase was much lower only 27 However in this last group a significant negative relationship between the quantity of acetaldehyde bound to microsomal proteins and the monooxygenasecatalyzed transformation of butanol by liver microsomes was demonstrated r  079 P less than 001 These results suggest that proteins of liver microsomes are a target for acetaldehyde binding during ethanol oxidation and such adduct formation could impair the oxidative properties of the alcoholinducible cytochrome P450
R864	Fatigue is one of the 10 most common reasons for visiting a physician Yet little is known about its course or impact from the patients perspective on quality of life or utilization of medical care The Dartmouth COOP Project a primary care research network conducted a oneyear prospective study comparing chief complaint fatigue CCF patients with two agesex matched comparison groups N  243 Results show that almost 67 of the CCF patients improved over one year however they had much higher utilization rates and substantial limitations in physical and emotional function Fatigue was associated with physical symptoms and interference with many aspects of daily life We conclude that fatigue has a powerful adverse effect on quality of life We hope the findings may help physicians to better understand and treat patients who seek care for fatigue
R865	The ability of lymphocyte populations to recognize and bind high endothelial venules during homing into lymphoid tissues and sites of chronic inflammation is critically dependent on their expression of certain homingassociated adhesion molecules known as homing receptors HR In animal models certain lymphocyte populations particularly subsets of memory or previously activated lymphocytes demonstrate tissueselective homing behavior and it has been hypothesized that differential expression of HR accounts for this selective migration In this study we analyzed expression of human HRthe Dreg 56Leu 8defined peripheral lymph node PLN HR also known as LECAM1 HCAM CD44 and alpha 4integrins CD49d VLA4among subsets of thymocytes and peripheral blood T cells to identify populations with differential homing potential In the thymus these three HR classes are differentially regulated relative to phenotypically defined maturational stages but are all expressed on the mature surface CD3high subset In the peripheral blood virgin T cells LFA3CD58low show uniform high expression of the PLN HR uniform relatively low expression of HCAM and alpha 4integrin and lack markers of tissue associationthe mucosal and cutaneous lymphocyte associated Ag MLA and CLA Ags defined by mAb Ber ACT8 and HECA452 respectively In contrast circulating memory T cells LFA3CD58high are bimodal with respect to PLN HR expression show uniform high expression of HCAM and alpha 4integrin and contain essentially all the CLA and MLA Agbearing T cells The circulating skinassociated T cell subset CLA Ag 10 to 15 of total T cells is predominantly PLN HR and shows high levels of both the alpha 4 and beta 1integrin chains The distinct mucosaassociated T cell subset MLA Ag 1 to 3 of peripheral blood T cells is predominantly PLN HR and is alpha 4high but beta 1low These findings indicate the independent regulation of homingassociated adhesion molecules among populations of memorypreviously activated T cells and suggest that the expression patterns of these molecules contribute to or perhaps determine the tissue distribution of these subsets
R866	Adequate enteral nutritional support is often limited by gastrointestinal GI side effects In this pilot clinical trial we compared an enteral nutrition formula based on soy hydrolysate study formula SF against a widely used intact casein formula control formula CF for the incidence of GI side effects in a completely randomized double blind design Twentythree nonsurgical hospitalized patients requiring enteral nutritional support and free of GI symptoms were randomly assigned to receive either the CF or the SF for 6 days continuously Both formulas were isotonic low in residue lactose free and isocaloric but differed in the type and concentration of protein and the concentration of mediumchain triglycerides After randomization both groups were comparable in demographic characteristics and nutritional status but there were more patients on antibiotics in the CF group The amount of formula infused per day and the route of administration were equivalent The number of bowel movements per day was 10  05 for the CF group and 06  03 for the SF group p less than 005 The incidence of diarrhea was 108 days for the CF group and 62 for the SF group p  NS High gastric residuals occurred in 169 of days in the CF group and 33 in the SF group p less than 005 Vomiting incidence was 108 in the CF group and 15 in the SF group p less than 005 After adjustment for the use of antibiotics as a covariate the differences in number of bowel movements vomiting and incidence of high residuals became less significant p less than 010ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R867	One hundred one consecutive patients with chronic coronary artery disease who had survived outofhospital cardiac arrest in the absence of acute myocardial infarction underwent electrophysiologic evaluation and were followed prospectively Ventricular tachyarrhythmias were inducible in 76 patients 75 in the control state and were suppressed by antiarrhythmic drugs or surgery in 32 of the 76 patients 42 During a mean followup of 27 months cardiac arrest recurred in 21 patients in two of the 25 patients in whom ventricular tachyarrhythmias were not inducible in the control state three of the 32 in whom inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias were suppressed after treatment and 16 of the 44 in whom inducible ventricular tachyarrhythmias could not be suppressed after treatment Actuarial rate of cardiac arrest recurrence was 112 during the first 6 months of followup highrisk early phase and then decreased to less than 4 in each subsequent 6month period Multivariate Cox proportional hazards analysis identified an ejection fraction less than 35 p  00013 and persistent inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias p  00025 as independent predictors of cardiac arrest recurrence for the entire followup period Separate analysis of variables within and after the first 6 months showed that an ejection fraction less than 35 was the strongest predictor for early phase recurrence p  00078 but had only marginally significant predictive value for late phase recurrence p  00516 Persistent inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias had no significant predictive value for early phase recurrence p  01382 but was the strongest predictor for late phase recurrence p  00061 These data suggest that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who survive outofhospital cardiac arrest poor ejection fraction and persistent inducibility of ventricular tachyarrhythmias have a different predictive influence on early and late phase recurrence Timedependent risk factor analysis may have great clinical relevance in assessing an individuals changing risk over time
R868	This study was performed to investigate the role of cellmediated immunity in primary glomerular diseases PGD by estimating natural killer NK activity from peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC assayed against K562 cells and antibodydependent cellmediated cytotoxicity ADCC activity from PBMC assayed against chicken red blood cells The proportion of PBMC was examined by flow cytometry using the monoclonal antibodies OKT and Leu series NK activity in patients with nephrotics of minimal change nephrotic syndrome MCNS membranous glomerulonephritis MGN and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis MPGN was significantly lower compared to those of the normal controls In addition ADCC activity in patients with nephrotics of MPGN was significantly lower compared to the normal controls The sera from patients with diminished NK activity inhibited NK activity of PBMC from healthy individuals Furthermore OKM1 positive lymphocytes were significantly higher in the MCNS MGN and MPGN patients and Leu7 positive lymphocytes were significantly higher in the MPGN patients These data suggest that several mechanisms contribute to the defects of NK and ADCC activities in patients with PGD and the defects in NK and killer cells are common in patients with nephrotics of MCNS MGN and MPGN and may be important in the pathogenesis of PGD
R869	Ninetytwo most severely injured patientswith injuries to at least four body regions with a mean ISS of 39were examined at the outpatient clinic 5 to 20 years after the trauma In addition nine patients were interviewed by phone thus 926 of the patients still alive were contacted Of those who were not retired before the injury 59 of 82 72 had been able to return to work and most of them were still working at the time of the followup The main reasons for inability to work were brain and spinal cord injuries blindness and failure in reeducation Most complaints arose from sequelae of brain pelvic and upper and lower extremity injuries Only seven patients needed constant medication because of their injuries We conclude that the treatment of even the most severely injured patients with multiple injuries is certainly worth the effort
R870	Ophthalmic manifestations were studied in 34 patients suffering from AIDS Ophthalmic disorders were found in 20 of these 58 the most frequent being a cottonwooltype spot 947 Three patients showed an ophthalmic state compatible with choroid ischemia and atrophy of the pigmented epithelium of the retina Three patients had necrotizing retinitis probably of viral etiology cytomegalovirus Other disorders observed were intraretinal hemorrhages Roths spots microaneurysms periphlebitis and ocular infiltration by Kaposis sarcoma
R871	The effect of protein energy malnutrition PEM on retinal function was investigated in weanling LongEvans rats fed a low protein 42 diet After 8 wk plasma retinol levels were lower in low protein LP and growthrestricted GR groups than in ad libitum controls P less than 005 however ocular vitamin A concentration remained normal Plasma taurine concentration was lower only in the LP group while retinal taurine was lower in both LP and GR groups than in control groups The darkadapted electroretinogram ERG became abnormal eg depressed a and b waves P less than 005 in both LP and GR groups but was corrected by ad libitum feeding of the control diet for an additional 8 wk In a second study weanling LP rats were supplemented with 04 taurine 04 methionine or 04 glycine Although taurine supplementation maintained plasma and retinal taurine stores ERGs remained abnormal with retinal sensitivity significantly lower than in unsupplemented LP rats Thus PEM produced abnormal ERGs independent of ocular vitamin A concentration and retinal taurine levels The high dietary taurine fed to proteinmalnourished rats caused further impairment of visual function but was not detrimental to control or pairfed rats
R872	We determined the effect of topically applied ibuprofen on formation of seconddegree burn edema and prostanoid production a possible causative factor Six adult sheep were given seconddegree burns on both flanks with water at 80 degrees C while they were under general anesthesia Lymph QL draining the flank areas was used to monitor edema formation and prostanoid production A 5 ibuprofen cream was applied at 2 and 5 hours after the burn and fullthickness biopsy specimens of burned hide were obtained at 8 hours for determination of water content The QL increased sixfold in nontreated and 25 times in treated burn tissue The lymphplasma LP protein ratio increased from 04 to 058 in both sides Lymph TxB2 was increased from baseline of 200 pgml to 500  100 and 310  90 pgml in untreated and treated sides respectively Lymph 6ketoPGF1 alpha increased from a baseline of 50  10 to 150  40 and 90  80 pgml in untreated and treated sides The difference between PG content of lymph in treated and untreated sides was significant Plasma prostanoids except for a transient early rise remained at preburn baseline Lymph ibuprofen content on the treated side rose to 19  08 mcgml with no detectable plasma level Water content of hide increased from a control value of 74  2 to 84  2 in untreated burn while the value in the treated side was 76  4 a significant difference between the two sides We conclude that topically applied ibuprofen decreases both local edema and prostanoid production in burn tissue without altering systemic production
R873	Followup examinations to determine the frequency of thyroidal disorders were conducted by the Radiation Effects Research Foundation RERF on individuals in Hiroshima and Nagasaki who were less than 20 yr of age at the time of exposure to the atomic bomb Concentrations of serum thyroid stimulating hormone TSH thyroglobulin TG and antiTG antibody 30 yr after exposure were also determined Nontoxic uninodular goiter was found in 13 cases of the 100  rad exposed group n  477 and in three cases of the nonexposed group n  501 The prevalence in the 100 rad exposed group was significantly higher chisquared  6584 p less than 001 Thyroid cancer was found in eight exposed cases all of whom were in the 100 rad group and the prevalence was significantly greater chisquared  7919 p less than 001 Regardless of the presence or absence of thyroid disorders serum TSH and TG levels were not statistically different between the 100 rad  exposed and nonexposed groups Although hypothyroidism was found in 23 of the total cases there was no correlation between its development and exposure to ionizing irradiation
R874	From 1982 to 1987 114 patients underwent operation at Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center for softtissue sarcoma of the retroperitoneum A retrospective analysis of these patients defines the biologic behavior surgical management of primary and recurrent disease predictive factors for outcome and impact of multimodality therapy Complete resection was possible in 65 of primary retroperitoneal sarcomas and strongly predicts outcome p less than 0001 The rate of complete resection was not altered by histologic type size or grade of tumor These patients had a median survival of 60 months compared to 24 months for those undergoing partial resection and 12 months for those with unresectable tumors Fortynine per cent of completely resected patients have had local recurrence This is the site of first recurrence in 75 of patients These patients undergo reoperation when feasible Complete resection of recurrent disease was performed in 39 of 88 44 operations with a 41month median survival time after reoperation Tumor grade was a significant predictor of outcome p less than 0001 Highgrade tumors n  65 were associated with a 20month median survival time compared to 80 months for lowgrade tumors n  49 Gender histologic type size previous biopsy and partial resection versus unresectable tumors did not predict outcome by univariate analysis Adjuvant radiation therapy and chemotherapy could not be shown to have significant impact on survival Concerted attempt at complete resection of both primary and recurrent retroperitoneal softtissue sarcoma is indicated
R875	Corneal edema from congenital glaucoma is a rare indication for penetrating keratoplasty We report the complications and problems associated with eight consecutive penetrating keratoplasties performed in adult eyes with a history of congenital glaucoma Only 25 of the eyes achieved 2040 or better vision after surgery These generally poor results can be attributed to previous glaucomatous optic nerve damage to complications related to previous surgery and possibly to amblyopia The most common surgical complication was postoperative elevation of intraocular pressure which occurred in all the cases 88 eyes and required permanent augmentation of glaucoma medications in seven eyes 88 and glaucoma surgery in four eyes 50 Two eyes 25 developed corneal graft failure one from immune rejection and the other from severe postoperative glaucoma necessitating cyclocryotherapy In view of these complications and the multiple impediments to good postoperative vision we advise that penetrating keratoplasty be reserved for patients with severe visual disability whose preoperative glaucoma is well controlled
R876	Thrombospondin with fibrinogen fibronectin and von Willebrand factor binds to platelets stimulated with agonists and support platelet adhesive functions The receptors for the latter three proteins are associated with membrane glycoprotein GPIIbIIIa Thrombasthenic platelets deficient in GPIIbIIIa have been utilized to examine the role of this membrane protein in the interactions of thrombospondin with platelets Radioiodinated thrombospondin bound to thrombinstimulated platelets from normal and thrombasthenic donors with a similar affinity and capacity As monitored with a monoclonal antibody to thrombospondin the divalent iondependent and independent pathways for the expression of the endogenous pool of thrombospondin on the surface of thrombinstimulated platelets from normal and thrombasthenic donors were also qualitatively and quantitatively similar GPIIbIIIa or ligands associated with GPIIbIIIa thus are not essential for the binding of thrombospondin to platelets Therefore thrombospondin interacts with unique receptors on platelets
R877	Nuclear magnetic resonance NMR imaging has been shown to accurately portray cardiac anatomy and function To investigate the potential of NMR imaging for the assessment of coronary stenosis in patients with chest pain ultrafast NMR imaging in conjunction with a T1 longitudinal relaxation time contrast agent was performed in 17 patients with chest pain who had undergone cardiac catheterization These included 12 patients with significant coronary artery stenoses and 4 who underwent repeat NMR study after myocardial revascularization Cardiac images at rest were obtained during rapid intravenous injection of gadoliniumDTPA 004 mMkg Electrocardiographicgated images were acquired over 380 ms with repetitive images obtained every 3 to 4 s After contrast injection there was pronounced signal enhancement in the right ventricular cavity followed by enhancement in the left ventricular cavity and myocardium Regional myocardium perfused by a diseased vessel demonstrated a lower peak signal intensity p  0001 and lower rate of signal increase p  0001 than did myocardium perfused by coronary arteries without stenosis Repeat NMR study after revascularization showed an increase in peak signal intensity p less than 0002 These results demonstrate the clinical potential of dynamic gadoliniumDTPAenhanced NMR imaging for the assessment of coronary artery disease in patients with chest pain In combination with anatomic and functional NMR imaging this technique has the potential to provide a comprehensive noninvasive cardiac evaluation of patients with suspected coronary artery disease
R878	Basal and pentagastrinstimulated gastric acid secretion fasting serum gastrin concentrations and the gastric output of prostaglandin E and its major metabolite 1314dihydro 15keto prostaglandin E2 were measured in 9 normal subjects before and after 1420 days of dietary supplementation with linoleic acid Mean maximal gastric acid output fell from 360  33 SEM to 301  29 mmolh p less than 005 although mean basal acid output was not significantly affected 83  21 and 72  17 mmolh respectively Mean fasting serum gastrin concentrations increased from 192  31 to 309  38 ngL p less than 001 after linoleic acid probably because of acid suppression The mean output of prostaglandin E increased from 498  110 to 1254  465 ngh p less than 005 that of its metabolite increased from 165  18 to 1168  645 ngh p less than 001 These findings show that in normal subjects essential fatty acid weakly inhibits gastric acid secretion but considerably increases gastric prostaglandin output
R879	Changes in plasma glucose and insulin concentrations were monitored over 24 hours in 28 African patients receiving quinine intravenously in an average dose of 85 mg basekg over one hour eight hourly for severe malaria The patients nine children and 19 adults were moderately undernourished none was pregnant or had renal insufficiency Plasma insulin concentrations rose during the infusion and then declined Plasma glucose concentrations were decreased at two three and four hours after the start of the infusion Insulin glucose ratios were raised between half an hour and two hours after the start of the infusion The three infusions of quinine increased plasma insulin concentrations in a similar way In nine patients including four children plasma glucose concentrations fell below 28 mmoll on one or two occasions At the time of the hypoglycaemia plasma insulin concentrations were inappropriately high as shown by a consistent and often considerable increase in the insulinglucose ratio Hypoglycaemia that may pass unnoticed in comatose patients is thus a common complication of treating severe malaria with quinine in particular in children Its high incidence calls for attentive monitoring and preventive measures
R880	The hypothesis tested was that feeding rats sucrose rather than invert sugar 5050 mixture of glucose and fructose or cornstarch would result in a more rapid excretion of glucuronides and tritium from intravenously injected 123Haldosterone Thirty 56dold male rats of the SpragueDawley strain were fed for 8 wk one of three diets containing 45 of dietary energy from sucrose invert sugar or cornstarch 15 of energy was from protein and 40 from fat Body weights and systolic blood pressures were measured weekly After 60 d of feeding the diets ad libitum all rats were injected intravenously with 123Haldosterone and the percent recovery of tritium in both urine and feces was determined over the next 4 d Urinary and fecal excretion of both free and conjugated glucuronic acid was determined over those 4 d Urinary excretion of sodium and potassium mgd was also determined There were no differences between groups in food or water intakes body weights systolic blood pressures daily fecal weights and daily urine volumes The cornstarchfed group excreted less sodium and potassium than did the other groups P less than 005 The sucrosefed group had a greater 4d excretion of tritium urinary  fecal than did the invert sugar or cornstarchfed groups P less than 001 The sucrosefed group had a greater percentage of excreted glucuronic acid that was conjugated urinary  fecal than did the invert sugar or cornstarchfed groups P less than 005 These results tended to confirm the hypothesis
R881	We have described a patient with neurogenic hyperthermia caused by a diencephalic infarction His hypothalamic dysfunction was a consequence of cerebral vasospasm from aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage Persistent elevation of body temperature did not respond to standard therapy but successful treatment was achieved with cyproheptadine and indomethacin presumably through antagonism of serotonin and prostaglandin activity
R882	Factors influencing microbial protein synthesis in the rumen have been reviewed several times in recent years Original publications in the past 3 yr have reported microbial and feed protein nitrogen contribution postruminally when feeding a variety of dietary proteins Ammonia is a satisfactory source of nitrogen for growth of the majority of rumen species but substitution of intact protein for urea source of ammonia usually stimulates microbial protein production Protein sources such as soybean meal appear to possess properties perhaps rate of degradability that optimize microbial growth in vivo Protein sources more undegradable than soybean meal when fed as the major nitrogen source sometimes reduce microbial growth However nondegradable proteins may compensate for less microbial protein by supplying intact dietary protein postruminally so the amino acids potentially available may be equal to or greater than those available when readily degradable protein is fed Soybean meal may reduce microbial growth in diets containing grass silage at protein exceeding 168 Various measurements of microbial and intact dietary protein postruminally show that the contribution of each can be manipulated Accuracy of quantitative predictions of postruminal contribution depends on several factors that require more research
R883	The case histories of two patients who required the insertion of intratracheal stents are presented The peroperative anaesthetic management of one case included the use of high frequency jet ventilation of the lungs in the other case partial cardiopulmonary bypass was used The advantages and disadvantages of these two methods are discussed
R884	A study was undertaken to characterize the antibody response in rats exposed to trimellitic anhydride TMA by inhalation Total antibody levels directed to trimellitic rat serum albumin TMRSA from TMAexposed rats were assayed by an ammonium sulfate technique Total antibody levels in bronchoalveolar lavage BAL and the matched serum were compared by correction for the albumin content of each An ELISA was developed to detect IgG IgA and IgM directed toward TMRSA in BAL and serum and to compare classspecific antibody levels in BAL and serum by normalizing for albumin content The specificity of the rat IgG response was determined by ELISA inhibition with TMRSA and TMhuman serum albumin TMHSA and compared with reciprocal inhibition studies with serum from TMAexposed workers The levels of total antibody in BAL were three to 15 times greater than the levels found in the matched serum pair IgG IgA and IgM antibodies were detected in the BAL and the serum of TMAexposed rats but not in control rats In each of the four rats tested all antibody classes were present in equal or greater amounts in the BAL than in the serum Complete inhibition of the rat IgG binding in ELISA was observed when TMRSA or TMHSA were added as inhibitors Human IgG was inhibited in ELISA only by TMHSA In an animal model of human lung disease the levels of total antibody as well as classspecific antibodies directed against TMRSA were greater in BAL than in serumABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R885	The mechanisms of sensitization and attachment of drugdependent antibodies to RBC in druginduced immune hemolytic anemias are largely speculative Nomifensine has been incriminated in causing immune hemolysis in a large number of patients The hemolysis was usually of the socalled immune complex type less commonly of the autoimmune type and more surprisingly few patients had developed both types of hemolysis To determine whether nomifensine metabolitedependent antibodies ndab exhibit specificity for antigenic structures of RBC membranes 30 ndab were tested against large panels of RBC with common and rare antigens We found that only 14 out of 30 ndab were invariably reactive with all cells tested Nine antibodies were similar to the majority of idiopathic or druginduced autoantibodies not or only weakly reactive with Rhnull RBC Three antibodies did not react with cord RBC and could be inhibited by soluble I antigen The remaining four antibodies gave inhomogeneous reaction patterns or were even negative with selected RBC their specificity could not be identified On a Scatchard plot analysis of one ndab a maximum of 173000 drugdependent antibodies of the IgG class can specifically bind per RBC in the presence of the drug Although nomifensine and its metabolites do not attach tightly onto RBC our results clearly indicate that RBC do not act as innocent bystanders but rather serve as a surface for a loose attachment of drugs that possibly cause a subtle structural change in the cell antigens and by this means allow in vivo sensitization and a specific binding of the resultant antibodies This concept would explain why these antibodies can be directed against drugcell complexes against cell antigens alone autoantibodies or against both in the same patient
R886	In a 60yearold man two chest radiographs showed an apparently thickened pericardial stripe Echocardiography and surgery for aortic valve replacement showed no pericardial fluid or thickening An angiocardiogram showed that the patients right coronary artery was positioned more medially than usual because of levorotation of the heart producing the falsepositive fat pad sign
R887	Structural abnormalities of the cabl protooncogene are found in hematopoietic cells of more than 90 percent of individuals with chronic myelogenous leukemia Therefore cabl may be important in normal as well as malignant hematopoiesis Normal human hematopoietic progenitor cells were exposed to three different cabl sense or antisense oligodeoxynucleotides and the effects on myeloid and erythroid colony formation were examined The cabl antisense oligodeoxynucleotides inhibited myeloid but not erythroid colony formation The cabl sense oligodeoxynucleotides and bcr sense and antisense oligodeoxynucleotides were not inhibitory in this assay These data show that cabl is critical in normal myelopoiesis and may explain the relatively selective expansion of leukocytes in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia
R888	The purpose of these studies was to determine how exposure to FSH affects subsequent responsiveness of adenylyl cyclase and progesterone production to FSH in immature porcine granulosa cells in vitro Acute cAMP and progesterone responses to FSH and the postreceptor activators of cyclase forskolin and cholera toxin were determined after a 24h preincubation with FSH Pretreatment with FSH 11000 ngml resulted in an increase in subsequent basal progesterone production which was dependent on preincubation FSH concentration The cAMP response to FSH on the other hand was reduced after preincubation with FSH in a manner dependent on preincubation FSH concentration Removal of FSH with acidified medium and subsequent incubation in FSHfree medium resulted in recovery of the cAMP response to FSH indicating that attenuation of the response is reversible Attenuation of the cAMP response to FSH does not appear to be due to 1 a loss of activity of the catalytic moiety of cyclase since the response to forskolin and cholera toxin was not decreased by FSH 2 a decrease in coupling of the stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein with the catalytic moiety of cyclase since the response to cholera toxin was not reduced by FSH 3 inhibitory signals since preincubation with pertussis toxin did not affect the subsequent response to FSH or 4 cAMP itself since neither cholera toxin nor the cAMP analog 84chlorophenylthiocAMP affected the response to FSH It appears instead that FSH regulates FSH responsiveness by regulating the interaction of the FSH receptor with stimulatory guanine nucleotide regulatory protein
R889	Calcium currents were examined in an experimental model in the embryonic chick heart with a congenital malformation known as persistent truncus arteriosus This is a severe defect characterized by failure of conotruncal and aorticopulmonary septation of the embryonic heart tube As a result no separation into the aortic and pulmonary arteries occurs and there is a common outflow tract The hearts with persistent truncus arteriosus had a 26 greater ventricular to whole embryo weight which indicated that the ventricles were enlarged Both the lowthreshold Ttype ICaT and the 14dihydropyridinesensitive Ltype ICaL Ca2 currents were present in the ventricular myocytes from hearts at day 11 of incubation However day 11 hearts with persistent truncus arteriosus showed a twofold reduction in the peak magnitude of ICaL at a test potential of  10 mV without a concomitant reduction in the number of L channels detected by 14dihydropyridine antagonist 3HPN200110 and agonist Bay K 8644 receptor binding The results indicated that an L channel regulatory mechanism other than protein synthesis was affected These changes are consistent with responses to conditions of excessive hemodynamic burden that have been characterized in adult hearts
R890	The hydrolysis products of taxol have been isolated by highperformance liquid chromatography and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectroscopy In contrast to taxol the major hydrolysis product baccatin III has little cytotoxic activity and does not promote in vitro microtubule assembly In cell culture medium the concentration of taxol decreases with time and 7epitaxol which exhibits properties comparable to those of taxol both on cells and on in vitro microtubuli polymerization is formed Baccatin III is found in small quantities in the cell medium although it is barely detectable within the cells It is concluded that 7epitaxol is the major derivative of taxol found in cells and that its presence does not alter in a major way the overall biological activity of taxol
R891	The significance of fragmented activity obtained from the atrium during electrophysiologic study EP study was confirmed since it was always observed just at the onset of fibrillation It was preceded by extra stimuli or atrial flutter and the initial site of fragmentation varied from case to case The prematurestimulusinduced widening of the atrial wave was observed in some cases who had normal size of atrium and no heart failure The widening was augmented by administration of verapamil but not by procainamide suggesting that for such widening or fragmented activity slowfibermediated conduction seems to be responsible One case with intraatrial reentrant tachycardia developed fragmentation lasting for 10 second after verapamil Therefore some apparently normal atria may have a subclinical electrophysiologic abnormality that can be disclosed by premature stimulations or verapamil
R892	The sexing of subadult remains has been an ongoing problem in physical anthropology for many years This is due in part to the scarcity of subadult collections of known age and sex which are large enough to be used to develop and test analytical methods Several methods have been devised but few have produced reliable results In 1980 Weaver presented a method for sexing subadult ilia using a nonmetric trait the raised versus nonraised auricular surface which has an accuracy of 75 in fetal females and 92 in fetal males His method has not been tested for reliability on a different subadult sample An indirect test of Weavers method was made on a sample of subadult South Dakota Arikara Indian ilia by comparing the ratio of raised to nonraised auricular surfaces with an expected 11 sex distribution Bimodal sex distributions in the Arikara formed unrealistic sex ratios following an agerelated shift from a 61 raisednonraised ratio in newborns to a 14 ratio in young adolescence Significant age correlations were found both in the present study and in Weavers published results The agetosex correlations indicated no confounding in the present study The results of this test suggest that auricular surface morphology is not sex specific in subadult ilia but may be related to aspects of shape and morphology in pelvic growth
R893	Several studies have shown that disturbances of personality are poor predictors of response to antidepressants None of these studies however has used personality measures similar to the DSMIII We evaluated the relationship between antidepressant response and personality scores obtained on the Millon Clinical Multiaxial Inventory which provides personality measures congruent with DSMIII Personality features such as assertiveness independence and competitiveness distinguished responders from nonresponders However the frequency of personality disorder diagnoses did not differ between responders and nonresponders
R894	Sixtythree patients with Tcell lymphoma TCL were analyzed to correlate morphological and immunological features with clinical presentation response to therapy and survival Clinical presentation was severe with 59 of patients having stage IV disease 60 B symptoms 35 poor performance status 44 large tumoral mass and 40 a high number of extranodal localizations Morphological subtypes were smallcell in four cases diffusemixed in 29 cases monomorphic mediumsized in two cases immunoblastic in 21 cases anaplastic largecell in four cases and unclassified in three cases Immunological phenotypes were immature T in 11 cases CD4 in 26 cases CD8 in 13 cases and undefined CD4  CD8 in ten cases Response to therapy was poor except for the 39 patients treated by an intensive and sequential regimen nonHodgkins lymphoma LNH80 or LNH84 that gave a 77 complete remission CR rate with a 23 relapse rate Median survival was 35 months No correlation was found between morphological subtypes and other variables Helper CD4 phenotype seemed to have a better prognosis than other phenotypes Variables associated with long survival for all the patients were localized disease and absence of large tumoral mass and for the subgroup of patients treated by the LNH regimens CD4 phenotype absence of B symptoms absence of a large tumoral mass and less than two extranodal sites of disease
R895	An outbreak of human cryptosporidiosis occurred among previously healthy persons in a veterinary medical teaching hospital Human illness began after admission of calves from a farm which had been experiencing an epizootic of neonatal diarrhea due to Cryptosporidium The clinical syndrome in humans was characterized by watery diarrhea abdominal cramping flatulence and headache Cryptosporidiosis was confirmed by zinc sulfate flotation of fecal specimens in four persons three of whom had been responsible for the care and treatment of infected calves A fourth patient had washed her husbands soiled clothing and appeared to have been infected indirectly through fomite contamination Among 112 persons surveyed 26 232 percent had a diarrheal illness during the outbreak and nine met the case definition of a diarrheal illness lasting at least three days These persons were more likely to have had contact with a calf with diarrhea than were 52 referents who did not become ill during the outbreak
R896	Angioimmunoblastic lymphadenopathy with dysproteinemia AILD is classified as a nonmalignant condition yet the mortality associated with the disease rivals most malignancies Although a leading standard text recommends prednisone as initial management there has been increasing evidence that combination chemotherapy is the best initial treatment The patient described here achieved a complete remission with cisplatinbased therapy but later died of pneumonia perhaps because pathogens important in infections in AILD were not covered Specific recommendations for management are discussed
R897	Patchtest responses to serially diluted nickel sulphate and potassium dichromate solutions in patients with nickel and chrome sensitivity were assessed by pulsed Ascan ultrasound to determine skin thickness and laserDoppler flowmeter techniques to evaluate blood flow as well as clinical scoring There was a relationship between the dose of antigen and the test responses as measured by ultrasound and laserDoppler flowmeter techniques in both nickel and chrome sensitive patients Our data suggest that both techniques may be useful in the detection of allergic contact dermatitis in which there is a doubtful patchtest reaction as well as in experimental sensitization studies
R898	There are two theories as to why bracing may prevent the progression of idiopathic scoliosis curves the passive and the active theories The passive theory is that progression is prevented by the forces exerted by the brace The active theory is that progression is prevented by muscle contractions that arise in response to wearing the brace This study examined the active theory of brace correction Trunk muscle myoelectric activities were measured in ten adolescent females with right thoracic idiopathic scoliosis being treated with Boston braces Activities were both measured when wearing and when not wearing their braces Differences in braced and unbraced myoelectric activities were seldom statistically significant and never biomechanically significant Boston brace effectiveness seems not to result from active responses to brace wearing
R899	The authors describe suicide rates in Toronto and Ontario and methods used for suicide in Toronto for 5 years before and after enactment of Canadian gun control legislation in 1978 They also present data from San Diego Calif where state laws attempt to limit access to guns by certain psychiatric patients Both sets of data indicate that gun control legislation may have led to decreased use of guns by suicidal men but the difference was apparently offset by an increase in suicide by leaping In the case of men using guns for suicide these data support a hypothesis of substitution of suicide method
R900	The fetalpelvic index is a recently described means of identifying the presence or absence of fetalpelvic disproportion In this followup study the efficacy of the fetalpelvic index was evaluated in 49 patients requiring labor induction and was compared with two other methods used to identify fetalpelvic disproportion ColcherSussman xray pelvimetry and ultrasoundderived estimated fetal weight Twelve of 14 patients who required operative intervention also demonstrated a positive fetalpelvic index sensitivity  86 Spontaneous vaginal deliveries occurred in 35 patients all of whom demonstrated negative fetalpelvic index values specificity  100 Overall the predictability of the fetalpelvic index was 96 In comparison when used alone neither xray pelvimetry nor ultrasoundderived estimated fetal weight accurately detected the presence or absence of fetalpelvic disproportion in patients requiring labor induction
R901	The ability of urine extracts to inhibit sodium and potassiumactivated ATPase crossreact with antidigoxin antibodies and induce natriuresis in rats was investigated in 10 healthy subjects 10 cirrhotic patients without ascites compensated cirrhotics 27 nonazotemic cirrhotic patients with ascites and 10 cirrhotic patients with ascites and functional renal failure to assess whether reduced activity of natriuretic hormone contributes to sodium retention in cirrhosis No significant differences were seen between healthy subjects and compensated cirrhotic patients in any of these parameters sodium and potassiumactivated ATPase inhibition  1785  198 vs 2474  487 nmol equivalent of ouabainday digoxinlike activity  439  61 vs 480  56 ng equivalent of digoxinday natriuretic activity  036  015 vs 063  027 mumolmin Cirrhotic patients with ascites with and without functional renal failure showed significantly higher values of sodium and potassiumactivated ATPase inhibition 7081  940 and 5292  539 nmol equivalent of ouabainday respectively digoxinlike activity 1369  72 and 1163  79 ng equivalent of digoxinday and natriuretic activity 178  048 and 193  037 mumolmin than healthy subjects and compensated cirrhotic patients We saw no significant differences between these two groups of cirrhotic patients with ascites with respect to these parameters In the cirrhotic patients studied sodium and potassiumactivated ATPase inhibition and antidigoxin antibodies directly correlated with the degree of impairment of hepatic and renal function plasma renin activity and plasma levels of aldosterone and norepinephrineABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R902	The nucleotide sequences of 27 Tcell receptor alphachain variable region V alphacontaining cDNA clones isolated from a cDNA library derived from human peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined Eighteen different V alpha and 26 different joining J alpha gene segments are utilized in these clones The V alpha gene segments belong to 12 different subfamilies each containing from one to seven members Comparisons with the 16 different V alpha and 21 different J alpha sequences previously reported suggest that the germline repertoires for these gene segments are greater than previously estimated Flexibility in the sites of gene segment joining and possibly Nregion diversification also contribute to human alphachain diversity Comparisons of human V alpha regions indicate a high degree of variability spread uniformly across the entire V alpha region without obvious hypervariable regions However amino acids important for the maintenance of V gene structure are conserved
R903	Excessive fluid and electrolyte secretion resulting symptomatically in diarrhea has been associated with mast cell activation in a variety of experimental and clinical settings The present study has used a human colonic epithelial cell line to examine mechanisms underlying this phenomenon Acute addition of mixed mast cell mediators as a lysate of rat basophilic leukemia cells to epithelial cells led to prompt and sustained chloride secretion The response was partially inhibitable by an antihistaminic drug and an adenosine antagonist suggesting that histamine adenosine and possibly other mediators are responsible for producing the acute effect Supernatants from immunologically activated rat basophilic leukemia cells had similar effects Chronic exposure of epithelial cells to the lysate mediator preparation followed by washing had no effect on their basal electrical or electrolytetransporting properties However the chloride secretory response of the cells to subsequent addition of vasoactive intestinal peptide carbachol and heatstable enterotoxin of Escherichia coli was significantly enhanced whereas responses to an adenosine agonist or PGE1 were unaffected This study has therefore demonstrated two ways in which mast cell mediators can directly influence intestinal epithelial cells to secrete more chloride and hence to enhance fluid secretion in the gut The findings may be of relevance to our understanding of inflammatory diarrhea and may aid the development of novel therapies for this disorder
R904	cDNA clones encoding a glutamic acidrich protein were isolated from a bovine retina cDNA expression library The cDNA sequence contained an open reading frame of 1770 base pairs encoding a protein of 590 amino acids 64509 Da and untranslated regions of 60 and 490 base pairs at the 5 and 3 ends respectively The cDNA hybridized to a 24kilobase retinal mRNA The amino acid sequence derived from the cDNA sequence contains a glutamic acidrich domain in which 68 of 109 amino acids are glutamic acid In addition this domain contains four repeats of a peptide of 11 amino acids and two repeats of a peptide of 26 amino acids A polyclonal antibody raised against a decapeptide corresponding to the undecapeptide repeat sequence reacted with a protein in an extract of bovine rod outer segments whose molecular mass 65 kDa corresponded to that of the above glutamic acidrich protein The retinal glutamic acidrich protein showed homology with glutamic acidrich proteins from bovine brain and the Cterminal region of mammalian neurofilaments
R905	Two Hodgkins ReedSternberg cell HRS lines HDLM1 and KMH2 have phenotypes and functional properties very similar to those of HRS cells in tissues These two types of cells were induced to differentiate with a combination of phorbol ester retinoic acid and extracellular matrix The induced cells displayed the morphology of histiocytes or histiocytelike cells with a small round or oval eccentric nucleus and abundant cytoplasm In ultrastructural studies many cytoplasmic projections and rugae were observed These induced cells exhibited abundant cytoplasmic lysosomal enzymes such as esterase acid phosphatase alpha 1antitrypsin or lysozyme The histiocytic nature of these induced cells was further confirmed by the increased expression of many monocytehistiocyte markers including CD11b CD11c CD13 CD14 CD15 CD33 CD68 Mac387 and 1E9 In functional tests the induced cells were shown to produce interleukin1 tumor necrosis factor macrophage colonystimulating factor andor prostaglandin E2 Phagocytosis was detected in less than 5 to 10 of the cells when Candida albicans was added to cultures The results strongly suggest that HRS cells are related to cells of histiocyte lineage
R906	In order to identify possible mechanisms regulating the expression of Fc gamma RII we have examined the methylation status of the beta Fc gamma R gene in a panel of Fc gamma RII  and  cells belonging to several different lineages We used beta 1 cDNA probes derived from beta Fc gamma R gene transcripts which encode murine Fc gamma RII molecules We found that all CCGG sequences detected with these probes were methylated in the genomic DNA of the Fc gamma RII cells By contrast two CCGG sites were found to be selectively unmethylated in the DNA of all Fc gamma RII cells tested These sites could be assigned to the region of the 5 end of the beta Fc gamma R gene Besides the treatment of Fc gamma RII thymoma cells BW5147 with 5azacytidine induced a hypomethylation of the beta Fc gamma R gene concomitantly with the transcription of that gene as seen by Northern blotting and the expression of functional Fc gamma RII Conversely the DNAmethylating agent ethyl methanesulfonate completely reversed the phenotype of the 5azacytidinetreated cells to that of the Fc gamma RII BW5147 parent cells In ethyl methanesulfonatetreated cells the beta Fc gamma R gene was remethylated and the corresponding transcript was no more detectable We conclude that the methylation of a specific 5 segment of the beta Fc gamma R gene regulates the expression of Fc gamma RII in murine T cells B cells mast cells and macrophages possibly by controlling the gene transcription
R907	Viruses that cause in vivo persistent infections need to selectively compromise the hosts immunologic surveillance machinery in order to survive To understand the molecular basis of how this is accomplished we have analyzed persistent virus infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis in its normal host the mouse Earlier we noted by infectious center analysis that five in 104 lymphocytes carried by persistently infected mice contained infectious materials throughout the course of infection A previous publication extended these results in BALB mice by showing that the L3T4 lymphocyte subset in lymph nodes and spleens was predominantly involved Using cDNA labeled probes to the viral genome and in situ hybridization we report that 1 to 2 of circulating lymphocytes from several mouse strains contain viral RNA sequences for the three viral structural genes By FACS analysis the Thy12 L3T4 subset primarily harbors virus while viral sequences are usually not detected in the Lyt2 subset as early as 6 days after initiating infection in newborns and throughout the course of the persistence These findings suggest that incomplete presumably defective virus is generated in a subset of Th lymphocytes during persistent infection and that during this time infection of cytotoxic T cell subsets is minimal
R908	The authors sought to determine if isoflurane would attenuate effects of three different types of vasoconstrictors on isolated segments of canine epicardial coronary arteries removed from healthy dogs As the endothelium has a major role in regulating epicardial coronary artery tone and as it modulates the effect of many vasoactive substances experiments were conducted both on normal rings and on rings whose endothelium had been mechanically removed In addition the endothelium is thought to be damaged in human atherosclerosis Rings were suspected in organ chambers filled with modified KrebsRinger bicarbonate solution aerated with 95 oxygen and 5 carbon dioxide and connected to strain gauges for the measurement of isometric tension Isoflurane 23 15 MAC in the dog was added to the aerating gas mixture in half the preparations while the other rings served as control The vasoconstrictors serotonin phenylephrine or prostaglandin F2 alpha were added in increasing concentrations to the bath solution In the presence of endothelium vasoconstrictor evoked contractions were attenuated by isoflurane Maximal tension generated by prostaglandin F2 alpha in untreated rings was 114  18 mean  SEM of a reference contraction while following isoflurane it was 46  8 P less than 0005 In the absence of endothelium isoflurane attenuated neither prostaglandin F2 alpha nor serotonin evoked contraction and had decreased effectiveness against phenylephrine mediated contraction P less than 0001 It is concluded that isoflurane attenuates vasoconstrictorevoked contraction of isolated canine epicardial coronary arteries and that this effect is mediated by the endothelium
R909	A prospective urodynamic study in 61 incontinent women assessed the validity of the Bonney test in the diagnosis of true sphincter weakness stress incontinence The urodynamic findings in all the patients indicated that the Bonney test produced significant increases in the urethral closure pressure and transmission of impulse from the abdomen to the urethra which indicated occlusion of the urethra rather than elevation of the bladder neck The Bonney test does not differentiate between patients with sphincter weakness and those with bladder instability and therefore should be discarded
R910	Exposure of experimental animals to 2378tetrachlorodibenzopdioxin TCDD results in severe thymic atrophy and suppression of cellmediated and humoral immune functions However despite much effort the mechanism by which TCDD produces these responses particularly thymic atrophy remains unclear In this report we have examined the effect of acute TCDD exposure on lymphocyte stem cells in young adult BALBc mice to determine whether alterations to events early in T lymphopoiesis contribute to TCDDinduced thymic atrophy TCDD produced a dosedependent reduction in thymic weight and cellularity following a single dose of 5 to 120 micrograms TCDDkg This thymic atrophy correlated with a dosedependent suppression of the biosynthesis and mRNA levels of the lymphocyte stem cellspecific DNA polymerase terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase in bone marrow and thymus However the reduction in thymic terminal deoxynucleotidyl nucleotidyl transferase synthesis on a per cell basis was less than that observed in bone marrow Intrathymic CD4CD8 and IL2R expression demonstrated only mild alterations after exposure to 30 micrograms TCDDkg These data suggest that thymocytes are more refractory to TCDD than are preT cells To assess this possibility directly bone marrow prothymocytes from TCDDtreated donor mice were examined for their capacity to reconstitute the thymuses of adoptive irradiated recipients Our results indicate that prothymocyte activity was severely impaired by TCDD exposure and that this effect occurred at low tissue levels of TCDD In contrast we observed no reduction in the number of colonyforming unitgranulocyte macrophage and a moderate decrease in colonyforming unitspleen These data suggest that TCDDinduced thymic atrophy is the result at least in part of impaired thymic seeding by prothymocytes
R911	A study was carried out in 25 incontinent patients to evaluate some of the factors thought to be responsible for the success of retraining for fecal incontinence Subjects were initially allocated to one of two groups one group was trained to perceive small rectal volumes active retraining the other group carried out the same maneuvers but were not given any information or instruction Active sensory retraining reduced the sensory threshold from 32  8 to 7  2 ml P less than 0001 corrected any sensory delay that was present P less than 0004 and reduced the frequency of incontinence from 5  1 to 1  1 episodes per week P less than 001 Sham retraining caused a modest reduction in the sensory threshold from 29  9 to 20  8 P less than 005 but did not significantly reduce the frequency of incontinence Subsequent strength and coordination training did not significantly improve continence although at the end of the study 50 of patients had no incontinent episodes at all and 76 of patients had reduced the frequency of incontinence episodes by more than 75 This improvement in continence was not associated with any change in sphincter pressures or in the continence to rectally infused saline but was associated with significant improvements in rectal sensation The functional improvement was sustained over a period of two years in 16 of the 22 patients available for followup In conclusion the results support the use of retraining in the management of fecal incontinence and suggest that retraining may work by enhancing rectal sensitivity and instilling confidence
R912	We describe an unusual case of pruritus after intravesical thiotepa and diaphoresis shortness of breath chills and pruritus following intravesical doxorubicin therapy Such generalized allergic reactions occur uncommonly after bladder instillation of thiotepa or doxorubicin
R913	Left ventricular LV systolic and diastolic function was assessed in 12 patients after total correction of tetralogy of Fallot age range 5 to 18 years mean 10 and compared with 10 control patients Only 1 patient had a shunt before total correction that was performed at a mean age of 35 years range 03 to 8 At cardiac catheterization the following indexed LV parameters were measured enddiastolic and endsystolic volumes wall mass ejection fraction stroke volume and enddiastolic and endsystolic pressures and stresses The ratecorrected mean velocity of fiber shortening was calculated LV diastolic operant chamber stiffness and myocardial stiffness were calculated from simultaneous diastolic pressures and volumes in mid and late diastole using monoexponential formulas The 2 groups were compared by unpaired t tests The tetralogy group had higher mean enddiastolic 93 vs 74 mlm2 endsystolic 29 vs 19 mlm2 and stroke 64 vs 55 mlm2 volumes than controls Ratecorrected mean velocity of fiber shortening was lower in the tetralogy group 107 vs 124 Myocardial stiffness was higher in the tetralogy group 16 vs 11 Other indexes were not significantly different Thus LV function after total correction of tetralogy of Fallot may be abnormal with larger than normal LV size decreased contractile function and increased myocardial stiffness
R914	IgG containing material detected in membranoproliferative nephritis MPGN serum with a solid phase sp Clq ELISA has been presumed to be immune complexes However in serum from 13 MPGN patients containing large amounts of spClqbinding material sucrose density ultracentrifugation and sieve chromatography showed spClqbinding protein to sediment at 7S or cofractionate with IgG One serum stored for 12 years contained in addition spClqbinding material sedimenting at more than 19S Isolated MPGN IgG was shown to bind to spClq SpClqbinding material could be totally removed from MPGN serum by absorption with BSAantiBSA immune precipitates and by acid elution of the precipitates IgG binding to spClq could be recovered Fab2 isolated from pepsin digested MPGN IgG continued to bind spClq Binding of MPGN IgG or Fab2 to spClq was not inhibited by 2 M NaCl Incubation of MPGN serum with 125I Clq followed by sucrose density ultracentrifugation resulted in a peak of radioactivity at 11S the sedimentation rate of Clq giving evidence that material binding fluid phase Clq is not present SpClqbinding IgG was detected in 54 of 68 MPGN patients These results indicate that the 7S spClqbinding IgG represents antibody to a cryptic antigen revealed only when Clq fixes to a solid surface
R915	The results of internal mammary artery grafting in 50 patients with a body surface area less than 16 m2 were compared with those in 54 patients with a larger body surface area Age 588  82 versus 549  103 years old and prevalence of female gender 28 versus 4 were significantly different between the group of patients with a small body surface area and the group with a large body surface area respectively However the prevalence of unstable angina previous myocardial infarction extent of coronary artery disease and preoperative ejection fraction was not significantly different between the two groups The mean number of distal anastomoses was 30 and 28 and the mean duration of aortic occlusion was 656  230 minutes and 595  217 minutes in the small and large body surface area groups respectively not significant The mean free flow rate of the internal mammary artery was 656  168 mlmin in the small body surface area group and 780  216 mlmin in the large body surface area group p less than 005 The diameters of the anterior descending and the circumflex arteries were significantly smaller in the small body surface area group Two patients 4 died within 30 days of operation and one patient died later in the small body surface area group whereas no death was noted in the large body surface area group not significant No significant differences were found in the incidence of aortic balloon pumping perioperative myocardial infarction and serious postoperative complications between the two groups Symptomatic relief was equally good in both groups 92 and 96 The patency rate of the internal mammary artery was 95 4244 in the small body surface area group and 100 4848 in the large body surface area group within 1 year mean 23  24 months In conclusion internal mammary artery grafting can be performed safely and effectively even in patients with small body structure Though the blood flow of the internal mammary artery and the size of the coronary arteries were smaller in patients with small body structure excellent patency of the internal mammary artery graft and satisfactory symptomatic relief can be expected
R916	To compare the effects of hypoxia and ischemia on left ventricular LV diastolic function we studied 17 isolated isovolumic dog hearts by measuring LV diastolic chamber distensibility LV end diastolic pressure at constant volume wall thickness and myocardial pH in response to hypoxia at constant coronary flow or pressure versus global ischemia zero coronary blood flow Hypoxic perfusates consisted of methemoglobincontaining red blood cells suspended in lactated Ringers solution Brief crossclamping of the coronary perfusion line was used to assess the contribution of coronary turgor to chamber distensibility and wall thickness With hypoxia left ventricles showed a significant early 5 minutes decrease in diastolic distensibility and an increase in wall thickness at either constant coronary perfusion pressure or flow The increase in wall thickness was independent of hypoxiainduced changes in coronary turgor In contrast global ischemia produced an early increase in LV diastolic chamber distensibility and a decrease in wall thickness When global ischemia was continued beyond 60 minutes a decrease in LV chamber distensibility developed This diastolic contracture was not associated with an increase in LV wall thickness Myocardial pH decreased slightly during 15 minutes of hypoxia and markedly with 15 minutes of global ischemia Thus LV diastolic chamber distensibility decreased during 15 minutes of hypoxia while an increase in distensibility was seen during global ischemia of similar duration During hypoxia these changes were associated with increased LV wall thickness at either constant coronary perfusion pressure or constant coronary flow Prolonged ischemia led to diastolic contracture without an increase in wall thicknessABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R917	Resistance to outflow of cerebrospinal fluid Rcsf was determined by constant flow infusions and pressurevolume index PVI using bolus infusions in 114 patients with various types of hydrocephalus A clear correlation was found between PVI and Rcsf and to a lesser degree between these two parameters and baseline pressure The PVI was not related to patients age duration of disease type of hydrocephalus or ventricular size indicating that the relationship between PVI and Rcsf was genuine and not caused by patient selection It is concluded that in adult hydrocephalus compliance is not an independent parameter but chiefly determined by Rcsf
R918	This study analyzed the clinical characteristics of 69 neonates who were admitted to the University of Minnesota Hospital between January 1972 and June 1984 with early onset Group B streptococcal infection EOGBS and determined those features associated with fatal infection The incidence of EOGBS was 16 cases1000 live births among 7960 inborn infants the mortality rate for inborn and outborn infants was 28 Multivariate analysis identified five features adequately predicting fatal outcome birth weight less than 2500 g absolute neutrophil count less than 1500 cellsmm3 hypotension apnea and a pleural effusion on the initial chest radiographs With these five variables and an initial blood pH less than 725 a clinical score was constructed that correctly predicted outcome in 93 of patients in this study 87 sensitivity 95 specificity Autopsy findings in 16 of 19 infants with fatal EOGBS suggested that surfactant deficiency respiratory distress syndrome was common in preterm infants with EOGBS and contributed to their higher mortality compared with term infants

R920	Adhesive capsulitis occurs as a pathologic entity in the shoulder hip and ankle joints Thickening and contracture of the wrist joint capsule were demonstrated on arthrograms performed on ten patients ranging in age from 20 to 82 years The patients had pain and limited range of motion in the wrist The findings included 1 resistance to the injection of smaller than normal volumes of contrast material 2 obliteration of recesses and 3 extravasation of the contrast agent along the needle tract Closed manipulation under general anesthesia of the wrist on four patients resulted in some improvement in range of motion A distal ulna fracture in one older patient occurred as a complication of manipulation Careful technique and judicious patient selection are of paramount importance
R921	Esophageal function was prospectively studied in 50 consecutive insulinrequiring diabetes mellitus patients The patients were stratified in three groups A 18 without peripheral neuropathy PN B 20 with PN but no autonomic neuropathy C 12 with PN and autonomic neuropathy Twelve patients four B eight C had gastrointestinal symptoms including six with dysphagia Radionuclide esophageal emptying was abnormal in 55 70 and 83 of patients in groups A B and C respectively Eleven of the 12 92 symptomatic and 23 of the 38 60 asymptomatic diabetes mellitus patients had abnormal emptying Five of six patients with dysphagia had abnormal emptying Esophageal manometry was also performed in 15 patients Twelve patients had abnormal manometry These included nutcracker esophagus in two achalasia in one and increased percentage of multipeaked and simultaneous contractions in nine There were no significant correlations between radionuclide esophageal emptying manometric changes and symptoms Gastrointestinal symptoms were more common in the presence of autonomic neuropathy Delayed esophageal emptying was more profound in the presence of PN but abnormal esophageal emptying was present in patients with neuropathy as commonly as patients without Furthermore the presence of diabetic retinopathy duration or control of diabetics and fasting blood sugar did not influence the frequency of abnormal esophageal emptying Our data indicate that esophageal dysfunction is common in male diabetics even in the absence of clinical PN and retinopathy suggesting that diabetic gastroenteropathy can occur in the absence of significant diabetic complications Commonly observed abnormal esophageal manometry in diabetics is not necessarily accompanied by significant functional disturbances or symptoms
R922	Cultured skin fibroblasts were obtained from 11 children with lactic acidemia and neurological disturbances The residual activities of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex were 9 to 45 of control values in all specimens Immunoblot analysis of mitochondrial proteins using polyclonal antibodies against the alpha and beta subunits of the first component E1 of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex revealed markedly decreased amounts of crossreacting material in 4 boys who died in infancy Two of the boys were half brothers related through a common mother A fifth boy had an alteration of the electrophoretic mobility of the E1 alpha subunit and normal E1 beta subunit abundance The remaining 6 patients 2 boys and 4 girls had normal findings on Western blot assay and all 11 patients had normal E2 and E3 patterns These findings suggest that the E1 alpha subunit gene represents a genetically vulnerable site on the X chromosome Decreased abundance of E1 components appears to be associated with death in infancy A normal Western blot analysis is compatible with longterm survival despite decreased catalytic activity of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
R923	The results of management in 134 patients admitted to hospital during 1985 with ureteric colic are presented in relation to the size and position of a ureteric stone Spontaneous passage of a stone occurred in 100 patients and 34 required surgical intervention Stones measuring 5 mm or less in maximum dimension passed spontaneously in 92 of cases stones measuring 6 mm or more had only a 28 chance of passing Of 34 surgical procedures 19 were endoscopic In three cases a stone was removed under vision with ureteroscope and Dormia basket In five patients ureteric dilatation before attempted ureteroscopy permitted later passage of the stone In 1986 similar results were obtained with ureteroscopic stone removal performed in three cases Fewer open operations and more Dormia basket extractions were performed in 1986 In this series the size of the stone was closely related to outcome The high chance of spontaneous passage 75 in 1985 and 84 in 1986 puts the need for surgical intervention and in particular ureteroscopy into perspective in the management of patients with ureteric colic
R924	A 56yearold man presented with a clearly defined orange tumour in the posterior pole of his left eye A choroidal osteoma was suspected and ultrasonography confirmed the diagnosis Fluorescein angiography demonstrated subretinal neovascularisation on the nasal edge of the tumour which was treated with krypton laser photocoagulation twice Recurrent subretinal neovascularisation occurred one year later and was not amenable to treatment Three years after the patient first presented thinning of the tumour was noted on followup examination During the next 15 months the tumour completely disappeared leaving an area of retinal pigment epithelial and choroidal atrophy Total decalcification of the choroidal osteoma was demonstrated by ultrasonography
R925	CD43 sialophorin leukosialin leukocyte large sialoglycoprotein a heavily sialylated molecule found on most leukocytes and platelets was initially identified as a major glycoprotein of mouse rat and human T cells CD43 expression is defective on the T cells of males with the WiskottAldrich syndrome an X chromosomelinked recessive immunodeficiency disorder Affected males are susceptible to opportunistic infections and do not respond to polysaccharide antigens reflecting defects in cytotoxic and helper Tcell functions AntiCD43 monoclonal antibodies have a modest costimulatory effect on T cells natural killer cells B cells and monocytes and one such antibody has been shown to activate T cells directly To investigate a possible physiological role for CD43 a complementary DNA encoding the human protein was introduced into an antigenresponsive murine Tcell hybridoma We observed that CD43 enhances the antigenspecific activation of T cells and that the intracellular domain of CD43 which is hyperphosphorylated during Tcell activation is required for this function We also found that antigenpresenting cells can bind specifically to immobilized purified CD43 and that the binding can be inhibited by liposomes containing CD43 as well as by antiCD43 monoclonal antibodies
R926	The distributions of amphotericin B AmB in tissue were compared after intraperitoneal or aerosol administration Rats were sacrificed 24 h after receiving single or repeated daily doses AmB concentrations in tissues were determined by highperformance liquid chromatography After intraperitoneal doses of 4 mgkg of body weight per day for 7 days mean concentrations of AmB were 1227 552 and 431 microgramsg in the spleen liver and lung respectively After aerosol doses aeroAmB of 16 mgkg per day the mean concentrations of AmB in the lung were 279 microgramsg after a single dose and 988 microgramsg after four doses while the drug was undetectable less than 01 microgramsg in serum spleen liver kidney and brain The halflife of elimination of AmB from the lungs was 48 days according to serial sacrifices done after a single dose of 32 mg of aeroAmB per kg Treatment with 60 mg of aeroAmB per kg was well tolerated and produced no histopathologic changes in the lungs The aerosol route was much more efficient than the systemic route in delivering AmB to the lungs and it limited the accumulation of AmB in other organs Because AmB is eliminated slowly infrequent dosing schedules can be used These pharmacokinetic characteristics and its proven effectiveness in an animal model make aeroAmB a highly promising new method for the prevention of pulmonary aspergillosis AeroAmB should also be considered for use as an adjunct to intravenous AmB for treatment of fungal pneumonias
R927	We assessed whether a relationship exists between posttraumatic stress disorder PTSD and two quantitative aspects of war trauma the duration of exposure to combat expressed in months and the intensity of combat measured by ratings on the Laufer Combat Scale These stressor characteristics were measured in relation to PTSD prevalence and persistence Eightyfour veterans inducted during the Vietnam War who attended an orthopedic clinic participated in the study A significant association was found between duration of combat exposure and prevalence and persistence of PTSD The longest duration of combat exposure was found in patients who still suffered from PTSD This duration was shorter for patients in remission and still shorter for patients who had never developed PTSD Similarly a significant association was found between combat scale ratings and PTSD The highest rating was observed in subjects who still had PTSD The rating was lower in patients in remission and still lower in those who had never experienced PTSD Having been wounded which is one of the Laufer Combat Scale items and could be considered particularly traumatic was strongly associated with PTSD The findings are discussed in relation to the reliability and validity of the PTSD construct and to the contribution of factors other than stressor characteristics to PTSD symptom expression
R928	We studied the effects of oral nutritional supplementation on respiratory muscle RM performance in 25 ambulatory patients with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease COPD There was a relationship between body weight and anthropometric parameters of nutritional status triceps skinfold thickness r  067 p less than 0005 midarm muscle circumference r  053 p less than 0005 but body weight did not correlate with daily caloric intake serum albumin transferrin or blood lymphocyte count None of these measurements of nutritional status correlated with any measure of RM strength or endurance In a randomized observerblinded crossover trial patients were allocated to one of two groups In the first eight weeks of the study group A received nutritional supplementation and patients in group B were control subjects In the second eight weeks patients in group A were control subjects and group B received supplement Mean daily caloric intake and body weight increased in both groups while receiving supplement both p less than 005 Calories provided by the supplement were frequently substituted for normal dietary calories Any increases in RM performance in the group receiving supplement were matched by increases due to learning in controls We conclude that oral dietary supplements have no important effects on RM performance in ambulatory patients with COPD
R929	A case of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia associated with a St Jude Medical prosthetic paravalvular valve leak not detected by echocardiography or cardiac angiography and requiring thoracotomy for diagnosis and therapy is described The importance of considering the presence of a paravalvular leak in a patient with MAHA and a prosthetic valve even with a negative invasive cardiac workup is discussed
R930	When lefttoright shunting through the ductus arteriosus contributes to respiratory distress of the newborn premature infant the condition is termed generally as symptomatic PDA The physiologic setting of this condition and its definition are considered first in this article Subsequent sections detail the incidence of symptomatic PDA and predisposing risk factors followed by a discussion of its clinical presentation diagnosis and management
R931	New direct bonding composite resin products are available for esthetic and restorative dentistry As in vitro study was conducted to evaluate the stainmasking effectiveness of 57 opaquers or color modifiers Results of the testing on 265 specimens are reported ranging from minimal to excellent masking
R932	Magnetic resonance imaging during arterial portography MRAP was performed by the authors in a selected group of 12 patients with hepatic lesions A low dose of gadopentetate dimeglumine 4 mL of a 05molL solution corresponding to a dose of 005007 mmolkg was injected into the superior mesenteric artery during acquisition of breathholding gradientecho or rapid acquisition spinecho images Images were always acquired during the first passage of gadopentetate dimeglumine through the liver parenchyma An increase in livertolesion contrast was obtained with MRAP imaging contrasttonoise ratio  8  18 vs 19  27 Signal intensity enhancement of the liver was high signaltonoise ratio  948  242 while the lesion presented no significant enhancement signaltonoise ratio  055  022 Lobar portal vein thrombosis was detected in one patient owing to lack of enhancement of the left lobe of the liver No side effects related to administration of iodinated and paramagnetic contrast agents were observed This new technique provides specific enhancement of liver parenchyma with improved livertolesion contrast
R933	Two patients with pernicious anemia developed gastric carcinoid one 20 years and the other 1 year after diagnosis of pernicious anemia One of the patients underwent successful resection of the tumor while the second with diffuse gastric carcinoid was managed conservatively She is well and asymptomatic 32 months after the diagnosis We discuss the dilemma in management of gastric carcinoid associated with pernicious anemia
R934	The association between living arrangement and dietary quality of older US adults was investigated in 4402 adults aged 55 years or older who participated in the Nationwide Food Consumption Survey 1977 to 1978 Dietary quality was based on percent of Recommended Dietary Allowances for 3day intakes of nine nutrients More men living alone consumed a poorquality diet than did men living with a spouse particularly those 75 years or older for women this effect was seen only in the 55 to 64yearold group In general more women than men had poorquality diets A number of factors economic employment health status energy intake body mass index and nutrient supplement use were examined for their importance in accounting for differences in dietary quality of older men and women living alone compared with those living with a spouse Energy intake was the most important variable accounting for the association of living arrangement with dietary quality Evidence indicated that older adults living alone did not make poorer food choices than those living with a spouse but rather that they consumed fewer calories
R935	Polycentric 384month study of biofiltration BF with AN69s Since January 1984 39 uremic dialyzed patients have been included in a randomized prospective study to evaluate the clinical utility of BF The trial lasted 985 monthspt 38415 months of total observations and patients admitted had some not well controlled clinical signs major acidosis intradialytic cardiovascular instability intolerance to acetate dialysis hypercatabolism neuropathy etc We obtained some positive effects the incidence of intradialytic hypotension decreased 266 interdialytic body weight gain fell from 31 to 27 kg p less than 005 and the dialytic time per week was reduced from 123 to 100 hours p less than 001 At the same time dry body weight increased from 624 to 646 kg with worthwhile improvement of the acidbase status ABS in all patients This controlled trial showed that BF is particularly useful for patients suffering from severe acidosis andor cardiovascular instability
R936	The mammograms of 25 women and six men 33 breasts with lymphoreticular disease of the breast were reviewed Three patients had HD 21 NHL one bilateral three had leukemic involvement of the breast and four had plasmacytoma one bilateral All patients had identifiable and localized abnormalities in their breasts many of which were welldefined masses ranging in diameter from 2 to 9 cm From this series it would seem that lymphomatous involvement of the breast has a noticeable predilection to form relatively circumscribed masses on the mammogram However they lacked tumor calcifications or secondary changes such as the surrounding distortion or localized skin retraction often associated with primary breast carcinomas This nonspecific appearance usually compromises the proper diagnosis in a primary clinical presentation of a lymphomatous breast mass without associated axillary lymphadenopathy or known lymphomatous disease of the breast
R937	In an effort to define more precisely and objectively computerized tomography CT brain scan evidence of glioma patient response to treatment planimetric measurements of serial CT images of enhancing tumor areas were made using a digitizing tablet interfaced to a microcomputer for computing threedimensional tumor volumes The ability of a single investigator to measure a significant change in tumor volume was determined from that investigators coefficient of variation COV for triplicate volume measurements a total of 1701 on 155 scans of 27 patients with malignant gliomas Planimetric volume data were compared with geometric computation of volumes based upon the product of the maximum diameter of enhancing tumor and the perpendicular diameter for each image made simultaneously with each planimetric measurement The planimetric method COV was less than that for geometric computation and the former method was employed for analysis of response to therapy in these same patients Overall for a tumor volume change to be significant COV plus 2 standard errors of the means the percentage change was determined to be 20 However the smaller the tumor volume being measured the greater was the percentage change required in order to be significant Thus minimal measurable changes  were separately defined for large greater than 14 cc medium 8 to 14 cc and small less than 8 cc tumor volumes Tumor volumes computed from baseline prior to investigational therapy and from subsequent serial CT scans were compared with response defined as a significant change Responses to therapy based on significant volume changes were compared in each instance to the conventional visual viewbox comparison Gestalt of serial scans In 28 of scan comparisons planimetric technique sensitivity permitted determination of significant enlargement or reduction in tumor size while Gestalt comparison suggested no change The use of quantitative tumor volume analysis of planimetric determinations of changes in tumor size during investigational therapy appears to permit recognition of either progression or regression of tumor size earlier than by Gestalt comparison in onefourth of instances
R938	Through June 26 1991 cholera has been reported from seven countries in the Western Hemisphere Brazil Chile Colombia Ecuador Mexico Peru and the United States In the United States a total of 14 confirmed cases of epidemicassociated cholera have been reported among persons in Florida one 1 Georgia one 2 New Jersey eight 1 and New York four This report summarizes information regarding the four cases reported in New York and describes a new laboratory procedure used to confirm the vehicle of transmission in this outbreak
R939	The currently accepted empiric antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections in neutropenic patients may not cover the possibility of capnophilic and anaerobic bacteremia Many of these infections develop in patients with severe mucositis or periodontitis and the type of organisms recovered also suggests an oral source of infection We present two cases of bacteremia in neutropenic patients who had been empirically treated with ceftazidime and piperacillin plus amikacin In the first case a betalactamaseproducing strain of Capnocytophaga ochracea was isolated in the second case bacteremia was due to a mixture of Leptotrichia buccalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum These observations emphasize the necessity for a reevaluation of the possible use of antimicrobial agents active against betalactamaseproducing capnophilic organisms and anaerobic bacteria during empiric therapy in neutropenic patients with an oral source of infection
R940	A new type of vascular prosthesis made of polyurethane with a fibrous structure of the wall was implanted in the carotid andor femoral artery of dogs The healing process and neointima formation after implantation of this type of prosthesis was followed with light and scanning electron microscopy A total of 18 prostheses which had been implanted for 1 3 6 9 or 20 weeks were studied Endothelial like cells invaded the prosthesis over the anastomoses starting the first week after implantation The growth zones advanced steadily and prostheses measuring 3 cm in length were completely endothelialized by 20 weeks after implantation a mean growth rate of the endothelial like cells of 009 mmday Subsequently fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells grew between the neoendothelial layer and the prosthetic inner surface forming a new multilayered neointima Cellular elements of the neointima were firmly anchored onto the inner wall of the prosthesis by cells with extending cytoplasmic protrusions between the fibers of the prosthetic wall Since in this type of fibrous polyurethane prosthesis endothelial like cells continually grew until a new lining was formed apparently facilitated by the fibrous structure of the wall further investigations are indicated for progression toward clinical implantation of this type of prosthesis
R941	Alzheimers disease is the most common cause of progressive intellectual failure in aged humans The filamentous brain lesions which define the disease occur within neurons neurofibrillary tangles in extracellular cerebral deposits amyloid plaques and in meningocerebral blood vessels amyloid angiopathy They are found in lesser numbers in the brains of virtually all old humans A protein with a relative molecular mass Mr of approximately 4000 designated amyloid betaprotein or amyloid A4 protein is the subunit of the vascular and plaque amyloid filaments in individuals with Alzheimers disease normal ageing and trisomy 21 Downs syndrome The amyloid betaprotein is a small fragment of a membraneassociated glycoprotein encoded by a gene on human chromosome 21 which is telomeric to a genetic defect that causes at least some cases of familial Alzheimers disease Until now the pathological lesions of the disease have been found only in the brain although reports of phenotypic abnormalities in nonneural tissues have suggested that Alzheimers disease may be a widespread systemic disorder Here we report the detection of amyloid betaprotein deposits in nonneural tissues and blood vessels of Alzheimers disease patients including skin subcutaneous tissue and intestine The protein was also present in nonneural tissues in a proportion of aged normal subjects Our findings indicate that a principal feature of the disease process is expressed subclinically in tissues other than brain The occurrence of amyloid betaprotein deposits in multiple tissues suggests that the protein may be produced locally in numerous organs or may as in other human amyloidoses be derived from a common circulating precursor These observations affect the rationale for many experiments analysing the amyloid betaprotein precursor and its messenger RNAs in Alzheimers disease brain tissue and have major implications for the pathogenesis and treatment of the disease
R942	Recent studies suggest a role for insulinlike growth factor I IGFI in the regulation of hormone release from placental gonadal and pituitary tissues To examine whether IGFI may also regulate the release of PRL from human decidual tissue we have investigated the effect of recombinant human IGFI on PRL release from monolayer cultures of human decidual cells exposed to IGFI for up to 4 days IGFI 101000 ngml stimulated a sustained dosedependent increase in PRL release halfmaximal concentration 25 ngml beginning 48 h after initial exposure but had no effect on the intracellular PRL content The amounts of PRL released from maximally stimulated cultures on days 3 and 4 were 168  3 mean  SEM and 258  8 of control values respectively IGFImediated effects were inhibited by cycloheximide 36 microM suggesting that the increase in PRL was the result of newly synthesized hormone The increase in PRL release was not due to a generalized effect on protein release since IGFI had no effect on the release of trichloroacetic acidprecipitable 35Smethionyl proteins Radioligand competition studies indicate that the biological actions of IGFI are mediated through interaction with the IGFI receptor Binding of radiolabeled IGFI to decidual cells in suspension was specific saturable and displacable by unlabeled IGFI with a potency nearly 10 times greater than that of insulin Furthermore exposure of decidual cells to a monoclonal antibody to the IGFI receptor alphaIR3 completely inhibited both IGFImediated PRL release and specific binding of 125IIGFI to decidual cells Since the actions of IGFI occurred at physiological concentrations these findings strongly support a role for IGFI in the regulation of PRL secretion by human decidua
R943	Tumor necrosis factor TNF could possibly be instrumental in mediating injury to the CNS during bacterial meningitis In CSF of rabbits with meningitis induced with Haemophilus influenzae type b Hib lipooligosaccharide LOS TNF activity was first detected 45 min after intracisternal IC injection of 20 ng Hib LOS and white blood cells WBC first appeared 75 min later The peak TNF activity 45 ngml was observed at 120 min after IC and persisted for 5 h When 12 X 107 CFU of Hib was used to induce meningitis peak CSF TNF activity was comparable with that after 20 ng Hib LOS but the activity persisted for 14 h Dexamethasone DXM 1 mgkg per iv given 1 h before or simultaneously with IC Hib LOS reduced significantly TNF activity and meningeal inflammation Goat antihuman TNF alpha antibodies given IC with 20 ng Hib LOS or 2 X 106 CFU of Hib resulted in a significant reduction in CSF TNF concentrations which was also associated with reduced meningeal inflammation in Hib LOSinoculated animals We conclude that TNF participates in mediating meningeal inflammation associated with Hib experimental meningitis and that DXM when given before or with Hib LOS inhibits CSF TNF production and modulates the meningeal inflammatory response
R944	Two intralesional injections of interferon alfa2b 15 million U per injection into a progressively enlarging keloid resulted in a 41 reduction in its area Fibroblasts cultured from the keloid before and 9 days after the initial injection were compared with fibroblasts cultured from the patients normal skin with respect to proliferation and production of connective tissue matrix components and collagenase There were no significant differences in the in vitro doubling times of keloidal fibroblasts before p greater than 02 and after p greater than 05 treatment with interferon alfa2b as well as of normal fibroblasts in subconfluent cultures Multiple passages of keloidal fibroblasts before interferon alfa2b therapy assayed as confluent cultures produced more collagen 171 187 and 204 more glycosaminoglycans 153 and 141 and less collagenase 26 and 31 than the patients own normal fibroblasts In contrast keloidal fibroblasts after interferon alfa2b therapy persistently produced normal or subnormal amounts of collagen 107 73 and 64 and glycosaminoglycans 97 and 96 and normalized levels of collagenase activity 96 and 86 Normal amounts of fibronectin were produced by keloidal fibroblasts before and after treatment with interferon alfa2b
R945	The spontaneous expulsion of lipoma per rectum is an extremely rare phenomenon The present case report describes this event in a patient with lower abdominal pain and bleeding per rectum leading to exploratory laparotomy At surgery a large intussuscepting ulcerated submucosal lipoma remnant was identified in the transverse colon This unusual presentation of colonic lipoma is discussed and the pertinent literature is reviewed
R946	The effects of intravenous verapamil administration 01 mgkg as a bolus followed by an infusion of 0007 mgkgmin were studied using hightemporalresolution radionuclide angiography in 27 patients with hypertension Verapamil administration increased heart rate from 69  11 to 75  12 beatsmin p less than 0001 and decreased systolic diastolic and mean blood pressures BPs from 155  21102  12 mm Hg mean 119  14 to 142  1995  12 mm Hg mean 109  13 p less than 0001 for all Ejection fraction decreased significantly from 65  10 to 60  11 p less than 0005 peak filling rate however increased significantly only in patients in whom it was subnormal in the basal study from 22  04 to 30  06 enddiastolic countss p less than 0001 These latter patients had significantly higher values of left ventricular LV mass index than patients with normal or increased peak filling rate 129  22 vs 112  22 gm2 respectively p less than 005 The isovolumic relaxation period changes were inversely related to the baseline values r  083 p less than 0001 In the subgroup of patients in whom isovolumic relaxation period lengthened time to end systole decreased from 360  31 to 329  30 ms p less than 0025 and time to onset of rapid filling increased from 420  31 to 451  34 ms p less than 0025 whereas these 2 intervals had opposite patterns in patients in whom isovolumic relaxation period decreased or did not changeABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R947	The question of how the amino acid sequence of a protein specifies its threedimensional structure remains to be answered Proteins are so large and complex that it is difficult to discern the features in their sequences that contribute to their structural stability and function One approach to this problem is de novo design of model proteins much simpler than their natural counterparts yet containing sufficient information in their sequences to specify a given function for example folding in aqueous solution folding in membranes or formation of ion channels Designed proteins provide simple model systems for understanding protein structure and function
R948	The cyclic nature of cluster headache warranted a study of the 24hour rhythms of serum cortisol and melatonin They were both altered during cluster periods as compared with periods of remission and healthy controls The 24hour mean and maximal cortisol levels were higher and the timing of the cortisol minimum was delayed as compared to the same patients in remission Although there was no relation between the cortisol and melatonin levels and headaches the rise of cortisol following many attacks might in part represent an adaptive response to pain The nocturnal melatonin maximum was lower during cluster periods than in remission This finding and the dysautonomic signs during attacks may reflect a change of the vegetative tone in a hyposympathetic direction
R949	The surgical correction of chordee without hypospadias may be difficult and result in significant intraoperative and postoperative complications especially when there is an associated hypoplastic type I urethra Between 1981 and 1985 we treated 13 patients with this condition Of the cases 9 had a type I urethra 3 had type II and 1 had type III according to the DevineHorton classification Postoperatively glanular tilt persisted in 3 patients ventral tethering was present in 2 and a fistula developed in 2 for a 54 per cent complication rate Of the 7 complications 5 occurred in type I cases Complications may arise from preserving or attempting to preserve a thin hypoplastic urethra When the paperthin type I urethra is associated with an abnormal meatus the entire dysplastic urethra should be reconstructed If the meatus is normal clinical judgment must dictate which type I urethras may be preserved and which must be reconstructed
R950	A survey of the health and social conditions of a representative sample of 967 persons aged 60 years and older from the city of Florence Italy was undertaken in 1980 In 1987 a followup survey of this cohort was performed There were 391 documented deaths 408 survivors and 168 individuals who could not be located Functional ability at baseline was assessed using a World Health Organization 14item scale Indicators of physical health status included chronic disease status number of drugs physician visits and days of hospitalization After adjustment for age and sex both functional ability and indicators of physical health status were found to be independent statistically significant predictors of mortality The results of this study further support the view that biomedical and functional assessment are both necessary for a comprehensive evaluation of the older population
R951	The utility of CD4 lymphocytes in monitoring disease progression and prognosis of human immunodeficiency virus HIVinfected patients is well established We have modified a previously described antibody cocktail to provide complete lymphocyte subset analysis on 100200microL samples of whole blood This method optimizes accuracy of CD4 lymphocyte assessments and provides simultaneous assessment of four other lymphocyte subtypes of interest in specimens with absolute lymphocyte counts as low as 300 X 106L Lymphocytes are classified as Thelper CD3CD4 Tsuppressor CD3CD8 Tnull CD3CD4CD8 putative gamma delta Tcell receptor B CD19CD20 or natural killer CD3CD16CD56 The method positively discriminates against contamination of lymphocyte scatter gates by monocytes and unlysed erythrocytes and is compatible with a variety of cell preparation procedures Increased accuracy of CD4 lymphocyte determinations and simultaneous identification of other lymphocyte subsets whose relationship to disease progression is under study make this an efficient and informative method for disease monitoring and evaluation of therapy in HIVinfected patients
R952	Choroidal neovascular membranes CNVMs developed in eight patients after photocoagulation for clinically significant diabetic macular edema DME The CNVMs developed in areas where Bruchs membrane was ruptured and were diagnosed 2 weeks to 5 months after treatment Only six patients had symptoms The CNVMs were treated in four patients final visual acuity was poor in all eight patients This serious complication that follows laser treatment for DME may be related to the use of repeated smallsize shortduration laser or intense laser burns or both
R953	The 2year therapy effect on femoral atherosclerosis was evaluated in the Cholesterol Lowering Atherosclerosis Study CLAS a randomized placeboplusdietcontrolled angiographic trial of colestipolniacin therapy plus diet in men with previous coronary bypass surgery Different diet compositions were prescribed to enhance the differential in blood cholesterol responses between the two groups The annual rate of change in computerestimated atherosclerosis CEA a measure of lumen abnormality was evaluated between treatment groups A significant persegment therapy effect was found in segments with moderately severe atherosclerosis p less than 004 and in proximal segments p less than 002 When segmental CEA measures were combined into a perpatient score using an adaptation of the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute scoring procedure a significant therapy effect was observed p less than 002 Total variance of the annual change rate in CEA was as predicted from pilot studies but measurement variation was larger The therapy effect observed in femoral arteries although significant was less marked than the strong and consistent benefit previously reported for both native coronary arteries and aortocoronary bypass grafts
R954	Contemporary clinical evaluation of hypertensive patients must include observations encompassing the impact of environment behavior and sociologic factors on metabolism and physiology As evidenced by animal and human studies catecholamines are an important mediator between psychologic factors and cardiovascular physiology but direct measurement of catecholamine levels has not proved useful Measurement of hemodynamic variablesblood pressure heart rate and stroke volumeduring standardized psychophysiologic challenges is advocated With lowchallenge standardized stressors that include alpha and betaadrenergic stimuli inappropriate reactors can be classified according to whether blood pressure is elevated primarily by cardiac output total systemic resistance or a combination of both Hypertensive patients can be similarly distinguished and medication can then be customtailored to the underlying physiology Extensive laboratory and clinical evidence points to significant interrelationships between the central nervous system and the cardiovascular system Furthermore cardiovascular physiologic and metabolic perturbances are distinctly different under conditions of mental vs physical stress Most clinical testing assesses physical performance whereas the reallife challenges of today are primarily mental
R955	The content of glucocorticoid receptor GR and arginase in human gastric cancer and the corresponding normal gastric mucosal tissues was determined Among the 25 patients studied the GR content in gastric cancer tissues was 332  102 fmolmg protein versus 76  34 fmolmg protein in gastric mucosal tissues This difference is statistically significant P less than 0005 Of the 25 paired samples 19 cancer tissues contained GR whereas only seven of the normal mucosal tissues had GR The level of arginase in gastric cancer tissues in 19 patients was assayed it was 266  42 ngmg protein which is also significantly higher than that in normal gastric mucosal tissues 135  18 ngmg protein P less than 0005 Since glucocorticoids and arginase are potent immune suppressive agents the increased level of GR and arginase in gastric cancer tissue suggest that these glucocorticoidrelated factors in gastric cancer tissue may play a partial role in regulating cellular immunity
R956	CTL specific for HIV have been described in lungs of infected patients at early stages of HIV disease In order to characterize the evolution over time of HIVspecific CTL we have analyzed the cytotoxic function and the cell surface phenotype of the alveolar lymphocytes from 41 patients at various stages of HIV disease We demonstrated a progressive decline of alveolar antiHIV CTL activity and detected Ts cells from the lungs of patients with advanced HIV disease These alveolar T cells strongly suppressed the effector phase of antiHIV CTL lysis They lacked a marked specificity of function because they also block antiHLA CTL response and were not restricted by the HLAclassI transplantation Ag They displayed the CD3 CD8 and HNK1 markers were CD4 and CD16 negative and lacked NK activity The presence of Ts cells at late stages of HIV disease could thus partly explain the inefficiency of host defenses against HIV
R957	We noted a frequent increase in the serum enzymes amylase lipase and alkaline phosphatase in patients with Wilsons disease who are receiving zinc acetate therapy 25 or 50 mg elemental zinc three times daily Typically values are normal before the initiation of zinc therapy increase to slightly above normal after a few weeks of therapy and stabilize at the high normal range after approximately a year of treatment Very large dosages of zinc 800 mgday produce even further elevation of serum lipase and amylase without the symptoms of pancreatitis Pancreatic pathologic studies of a zinctreated rat model receiving dosages equivalent to up to 25 times the effective dosage in a human being which is based on milligrams of zinc per kilogram of body weight reveal that no lesions are induced by zinc treatment in the pancreas We interpret these findings to indicate that extended maintenance therapy with zinc does not pose a risk of pancreatic damage in patients with Wilsons disease
R958	An inexpensive hearing assistance device can improve communication with nursing home residents In patients who do not have prescribed hearing aids or who are being audiologically evaluated voice amplification with such a device facilitates initial assessment as well as ongoing care Such devices are available at local consumer outlets for under 30 making them available to persons who are unable to afford more sophisticated models
R959	Hyperglycemia accompanies a myriad of clinical conditions and causes an acceleration in the nonenzymatic glycosylation NEG of proteins Since many proteins lose function when glycosylated we assessed the effect of hyperglycemia on the function of immunoglobulin G Twenty newborn SpragueDawley rats underwent splenectomy and 20 splenic mobilization alone After 3 weeks all animals received an intraperitoneal injection of Streptococcus pneumoniae Twelve hours later ten animals from each group received either control CIG or glycosylated GIG human immunoglobulin 03 gmkg intraperitoneally Asplenic animals receiving GIG lived 285 hours vs 496 hours for those receiving CIG p less than 00001 Animals with spleens receiving GIG lived 482 hours vs 517 hours for those receiving CIG p  003 Shortterm glycosylation of immunoglobulin causes its inactivation This may contribute to the increased risk of infection noted in hyperglycemic animals
R960	The effects of probenecid on the electrophysiology ion transport properties and permeability characteristics of the canine tracheal epithelium mounted in Ussing chambers were studied Mucosal addition of probenecid had 2 effects at low concentrations 01 to 05 mM probenecid increased shortcircuit current Isc and net Cl secretion whereas higher concentrations 5 and 10 mM decreased Isc and net Cl secretion 1 mM probenecid had no effect The change in Isc was accounted for entirely by the change in the net Cl secretion The effects were rapidly reversible and even after prolonged exposure were not associated with any change in the paracellular pathway as evidenced by mannitol fluxes Submucosal addition of probenecid produced a significant decrease in Isc and net Cl secretion only at 10 mM and the effect was delayed suggesting movement of some of the probenecid into the mucosal bath We conclude from these experiments that probenecid at concentrations greater than 1 mM inhibits Cl secretion in canine tracheal epithelium the effect is primarily from the mucosal side and is reversible Because probenecid is structurally related to a group of analogs of benzoic acid that inhibit the Cl conductance at the apical membrane we suggest that probenecid might also block the electrically conductive Cl exit pathway in the apical cell membrane
R961	A cytoplasmic protein that greatly enhances the guanosine triphosphatase GTPase activity of Nras protein but does not affect the activity of oncogenic ras mutants has been recently described This protein GAP is shown here to be ubiquitous in higher eukaryotes and to interact with Hras as well as with Nras proteins To identify the region of ras p21 with which GAP interacts 21 Hras mutant proteins were purified and tested for their ability to undergo stimulation of GTPase activity by GAP Mutations in nonessential regions of Hras p21 as well as mutations in its carboxylterminal domain residues 165185 and purine binding region residues 117 and 119 did not decrease the ability of the protein to respond to GAP In addition an antibody against the carboxylterminal domain did not block GAP activity supporting the conclusion that GAP does not interact with this region Transforming mutations at positions 12 59 and 61 the phosphoryl binding region abolished GTPase stimulation by GAP Point mutations in the putative effector region of ras p21 amino acids 35 36 and 38 were also insensitive to GAP However a point mutation at position 39 shown previously not to impair effector function did not alter GAPp21 interaction These results indicate that GAP interaction may be essential for ras p21 biological activity and that it may be a ras effector protein
R962	The effects of adrenalectomy on somatostatin SS concentration and specific binding in cerebral cortex hippocampus striatum and hypothalamus were examined using 125ITyr11SS as the binding ligand Adrenalectomy did not affect the concentration of SSlike immunoreactivity in the brain areas studied Nevertheless the number of SS receptors was significantly decreased in membrane preparations from hippocampus striatum and hypothalamus but not in cerebral cortex No significant differences in the apparent binding affinity values were seen after adrenalectomy The adrenalectomyinduced decreases in 125ITyr11SS receptors were completely reversed by glucocorticoid replacement with dexamethasone These results demonstrate that adrenalectomy modulates SS receptors in discrete brain areas suggesting the existence of a possible relationship between corticosteroids and SS in the neuronal activity of these structures The physiological significance of these findings remains to be clarified
R963	Clinical and laboratory measurements taken at the onset of rheumatoid arthritis in 149 patients were compared with the severity of radiological changes seen at 3 years in the hands and feet and cervical spine The strongest association with the severity of peripheral radiological damage was rheumatoid factor p less than 00001 for both the latex titre and RAHA titre Subluxation of the cervical spine was associated only with the presence of HLADw2 p less than 002 and HLAB7 crossreacting group p less than 002 Discriminant function analysis utilizing latex titre RAHA titre haemoglobin level and platelet count predicted the development of erosive or nonerosive disease in 79 This method was less successful in predicting the actual severity of erosive damage and was not improved by the addition of HLA data Radiological outcome in the cervical spine was successfully predicted in 82 using HLADw2 HLAB27 and age of onset of disease It is concluded that the best predictors of erosive disease were standard laboratory features measured at onset but that more powerful discriminant factors are needed if these are to influence clinical practice Further prospective studies will establish whether rheumatoid involvement of the cervical spine is an expression of the influence of HLA determinants in this disease
R964	The effects of fructose and glucose on selected blood parameters and blood pressure after 4 weeks of oral ingestion were investigated in nine impaired glucosetolerant subjects IGTS and nine normal glucosetolerant subjects NGTS The criteria for IGTS were 1 1 or 2hour postprandial glucose levels between 160 and 200 mgdL 88 to 111 mmolL 2 compliance with the diet and 3 no cardiac or renal complication The mean increment in the area under the plasma glucose and insulin curves after a glucose load was significantly greater following glucose than following fructose ingestion in both IGTS and NGTS p less than 05 Glycosylated hemoglobin was greater after glucose than after fructose ingestion in IGTS and NGTS 71 gmL vs 61 gmL in IGTS 61 gmL vs 59 gmL in NGTS Serum triglyceride level in IGTS fed glucose was 173 mgdL 190 mmolL whereas in those fed fructose it was 154 mgdL 169 mmolL Serum cholesterol was also greater after glucose than after fructose ingestion in all subjects However the differences were not statistically significant Urate pyruvate and lactate levels were significantly greater in IGTS fed glucose than in IGTS fed fructose Systolic and diastolic pressures were lower in IGTS fed fructose than in IGTS fed glucose The present study shows that a 4week oral ingestion of moderate amounts of fructose appears to have more benefits than an equivalent glucose ingestion in both IGTS and NGTS However greater benefits were found in IGTS than in NGTS
R965	Leiomyoma of the nose and paranasal sinuses is rare It constitutes about 1 per cent of all benign tumours This is due to the paucity of smooth muscle in the nose In this paper the authors present one case of vascular leiomyoma which arose in the inferior turbinate in a 64yearold lady It was treated by partial turbinectomy with the relief of her symptoms of nasal obstruction epistaxis and facial pain The English literature on the topic is reviewed
R966	Biopsies of human urinary bladder mucosa obtained during cystoscopy were shown to release eicosanoids in the following order prostacyclin PGI2 prostaglandin E2 PGE2 prostaglandin F2 alpha PGF2 alpha and thromboxane A2 TXA2 The total and the relative amounts of eicosanoids released were similar to those reported for the rat urinary bladder These eicosanoids may play a role in modulating the tone and contractility of the bladder as well as affecting cytoprotection of the mucosa In view of the abundant release of eicosanoids by the bladder caution must be exercised when considering urinary eicosanoid excretion as reflecting production by the systemic vasculature andor the kidneys
R967	GuillainBarre syndrome and HenochSchonlein purpura HSP appeared simultaneously in a 35yearold woman During the course of the GuillainBarre syndrome the presence of IgA aggregates and a decrease in complement components were noted in the cerebrospinal fluid These abnormalities disappeared when the neurologic syndrome remitted This suggests the responsibility of IgA immune complexes characteristic of HSP in the occurrence of the associated GuillainBarre syndrome
R968	The argon beam electrocoagulator ABC is a new form of electrocautery that is thought to be more effective than standard electrocautery It has been used primarily in procedures associated with major blood loss such as liver transplantation and laparotomy for trauma It has not been used in thoracic operations We evaluated the safety and efficacy of the argon beam electrocoagulator for performing pulmonary wedge resections in an animal model by comparing it with standard electrocautery and suture closure Variables used to compare the three methods of resection included perioperative blood loss duration of chest tube air leak and depth of necrosis and severity of inflammatory reaction in the lung at ten days and 3 weeks after resection The argon beam electrocoagulator was as effective as standard electrocautery and suture closure in controlling air leaks and caused less acute tissue injury than standard electrocautery The argon beam electrocoagulator provides a safe and effective method for performing small pulmonary wedge resections and should be evaluated in the clinical setting for this purpose
R969	The desirability of radiopacity in dental materials and other materials that may become foreign bodies is documented No simple reliable methods are available for the determination of radiopacity and no standard specifications have been devised with regard to the radiopacity of dental materials A method that enables radiopacity to be determined is described The theoretical aspects of radiopacity in relation to the method are considered Possible applications of this method in the development of standards for radiopacity are suggested
R970	The tatresponsive region TAR of the human immunodeficiency virus1 HIV1 exhibits a transinhibitory effect on translation in vitro by activating the interferoninduced 68kilodalton protein kinase p68 kinase Productive infection by HIV1 was shown to result in a significant decrease in the amount of cellular p68 kinase The steadystate amount of p68 kinase was also reduced in interferontreated HeLa cell lines stably expressing tat as compared to the amount of the kinase in interferontreated control HeLa cells Thus the potential translational inhibitory effects of the TAR RNA region mediated by activation of p68 kinase may be downregulated by tat during productive HIV1 infection
R971	The National Heart Lung and Blood Institute Bethesda Md sponsored national telephone surveys of practicing physicians and the adult public in 1983 1986 and 1990 to assess attitudes and practices regarding high serum cholesterol levels Each time approximately 1600 physicians and 4000 adults were interviewed Trends show continuing change in medical practice and public health behavior relating to serum cholesterol In 1990 physicians reported treating serum cholesterol at considerably lower levels than in 1986 and 1983 The median range of serum cholesterol at which diet therapy was initiated was 517 to 566 mmolL 200 to 219 mgdL in 1990 down from 621 to 670 mmolL 240 to 259 mgdL in 1986 and 672 to 721 mmolL 260 to 279 mgdL in 1983 The median ranges for initiating drug therapy were 621 to 670 mmolL 240 to 259 mgdL in 1990 776 to 825 mmolL 300 to 319 mgdL in 1986 and 879 to 928 mmolL 340 to 359 mgdL in 1983 The number of adults who reported having had their cholesterol level checked rose from 35 to 46 to 65 in 1983 1986 and 1990 respectively Between 1983 and 1990 the number of adults reporting a physician diagnosis of high serum cholesterol increased from 7 to 16 the number reporting a prescribed cholesterollowering diet increased from 3 to 9 Reports of selfinitiated diet efforts reached a high of 19 in 1986 and decreased to 15 in 1990 compared with 1 in earlier years In 1990 over 90 of physicians reported awareness and use of the recommendations from the Report of the National Cholesterol Education Program Expert Panel on Detection Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Cholesterol in Adults and the public reported marked increases in awareness of dietary methods to lower serum cholesterol These changes suggest educational gains the data also suggest areas for continued cholesterol educational initiatives
R972	Polyarteritis nodosa a disease of the media of small and mediumsized arteries has protean manifestations and many presenting signs and symptoms Gastrointestinal involvement is common but involvement of the biliary tree is rare We report a unique case of polyarteritis presenting as a biliary stricture
R973	This paper reports the results of bone scans on 78 painful feet Scanning helped in the diagnosis of persistent foot pain following injury and it enabled stress fractures fractures of the sesamoids and subtalar arthritis to be diagnosed earlier It reliably excluded bone infection and was useful as a screening test when radiographs were normal
R974	Postoperative biliary stasis is a common state before the onset of postoperative acute cholecystitis In order to study its characteristics and methods of prophylaxis we examined the frequency of biliary stasis and postoperative recovery of gallbladder contractility ultrasonographically from the 2nd to the 28th postoperative day in 43 esophagectomy cases A retrospective study in 17 patients revealed a high incidence of biliary stasis during the early postoperative period and improvement by the initiation of enteral nutrition Furthermore the contractility of the gallbladder recovered remarkably soon after the operation This first randomized prospective study concerning prophylaxis of biliary stasis in 26 patients showed that postoperative biliary stasis was prevented by early initiation of enteral nutrition
R975	Thrombosis of the deep cerebral venous system is usually fatal and patients are frequently stuporous or comatose at presentation This report describes serial radiological and neuropsychological observations in an 18yearold woman who remained alert and survived this disorder In association with diencephalic edema seen on computed tomographic scan she demonstrated disorientation abulia attentional deficits memory loss and dyscalculia and had impaired IQ scores the performance scores were worse than the verbal scores Significant aphasia or sensory loss was absent She recovered full intellectual capacity in the course of followup examinations and the diencephalic edema seen on the computed tomographic scan resolved despite persistent thrombosis of the straight sinus demonstrable on followup digital angiography
R976	Several lines of evidence indicate altered noradrenergic function in schizophrenia The authors examined resting standing and change standing minus resting in plasma norepinephrine levels in 14 drugfree patients with chronic schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and in 33 age and sexmatched healthy volunteers Schizophrenic patients had significantly higher resting and standing plasma norepinephrine levels and significantly greater change Resting and standing levels were significantly related to positive and negative symptoms There was a significant positive correlation between resting plasma and CSF norepinephrine levels and a significant negative correlation between CSF homovanillic acid and resting standing and change in plasma norepinephrine levels
R977	Emergence of resistance to imipenem during therapy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections is common and may result in treatment failure Resistance emerges most often during therapy for lower respiratory tract infections There are several unique features of this resistance to imipenem First crossresistance to other betalactam agents is not observed Second the mechanism of resistance in most of the isolates studied to date appears to be related to a selective permeability barrier across the bacterial outer membrane usually associated with discrete alterations in the electrophoretic profiles of outer membrane proteins These data suggest that imipenem may traverse the outer membrane of P aeruginosa via a specific porin protein that is not critical for penetration of other betalactam antibiotics
R978	Using the labeled microsphere impaction technique we studied the effect of peripheral panretinal transscleral cryocoagulation in pigmented rabbits One eye of each animal received peripheral cryocoagulation and the fellow eye of the same animal was used as the control Thirtytwo animals received 40 exposures of peripheral cryocoagulation twentysix rabbits received 20 exposures After 40 exposures of cryocoagulation choroidalretinal blood flow was significantly decreased when measured at one to two hours 24 hours and two weeks normal flow recovered by four weeks After 20 exposures of cryocoagulation there was a significant reduction in choroidalretinal blood flow at the earliest measurement time one to two hours only The irisciliary body blood flow also was substantially decreased only at the earliest measurement time one to two hours and only after 40 exposures
R979	The authors describe the use of duplex andor color Doppler ultrasonography of the pelvis in three women to demonstrate the presence of venous malformations One patient with a pulsatile vaginal mass was shown to have an arteriovenous malformation of the vaginal wall The second patient was shown to have an unsuspected venous angioma in the endometrial cavity The third patient was shown to have adnexal varices that closely mimicked hydrosalpinx In the latter two cases the duplex and color flow capabilities of an endovaginal probe were especially important
R980	Five hundred panoramic radiographs submitted to Delta Dental Plan of Michigan for preauthorization or claim processing were evaluated for frequency of occurrence of 15 categories of technical errors in patient positioning film processing and general film handling Only one radiograph showed no errors The average radiograph contained 22 positioning errors 10 processing errors and 15 miscellaneous errors for a total of 47 errors Of the 500 radiographs 467 had positioning errors 441 had processing errors and 424 had miscellaneous errors Diagnostic quality was judged to be adequate in 365 radiographs inadequate in 91 radiographs and marginal in 44 radiographs The severity of error was of more importance than the number of errors in the determination of diagnostic adequacy
R981	A functional electric stimulation system for standing and ambulating that uses a commercially available electrode garment has been developed The garment allows electrodes to be applied rapidly and securely Two channels of a fourchannel stimulator are used to stimulate the quadriceps muscles and permit the user to stand The other two channels are used to stimulate the peroneal nerve which causes a flexor withdrawal reflex and permits stepping The user controls stepping by handheld switches The system provides a means for standing exercising and limited ambulation
R982	Better in vivo techniques are needed for objective assessment of mast celldependent events Tryptase a neutral protease selectively concentrated in human mast cells appears along with histamine in skin chamber fluid overlying sites of allergen challenge in sensitive human subjects Maximal amounts of histamine were found 0 minutes to 30 minutes after challenge maximal amounts of tryptase were found 30 minutes to 60 minutes after challenge The later appearance of tryptase most likely reflects its slower diffusion through tissue after release of tryptase from cutaneous mast cells as a macromolecular complex with proteoglycan The mean weight ratio of tryptase 134000 molecular weight tetramer to histamine 111 molecular weight in chamber fluid after allergen challenge during a 1hour time course was 41 Total amounts of tryptase and histamine recovered in the 03 ml chamber fluid samples after a 1hour challenge averaged 95 ng and 26 ng respectively Tryptase levels in skin chamber fluid are an accurate indicator of mast cell activation
R983	A randomized controlled clinical trial of methanolextracted residue of bacille CalmetteGuerin adjuvant treatment of posterior uveal melanoma was undertaken Of 113 patients 34 patients received adjuvant immunotherapy and 79 patients received no treatment No difference in survival was observed between the adjuvanttreated group and the control group of patients This study found that the size of the tumor was a highly significant risk factor for death caused by metastasis of uveal melanomas The standard deviation of the nucleolar area of the neoplastic cells was a significant risk factor even though patients with tumors composed of Callenders spindletype cells were not included in the study
R984	Two unusual variants of bronchopulmonary foregut malformations are presented The first case was that of a 12yearold male with a history of pectus excavatum in whom severe lobar emphysema developed secondary to an intralobar pulmonary sequestration that communicated with the esophagus This case was unusual in that foregut communications and associated congenital anomalies are generally believed to be restricted to extralobar pulmonary sequestrations The second case was that of a 27yearold woman with an extralobar pulmonary sequestration that communicated with the esophagus The sequestration was unusual in that it arose in the anterior mediastinum and received the bulk of its blood supply from the pulmonary artery The occurrence of mixed forms of pulmonary sequestrations supports the hypothesis that extralobar and intralobar sequestrations and sequestrations with foregut communication are related thoracic disorders that are best considered bronchopulmonary foregut malformations
R985	Neocortical neurons in cell cultures prepared from fetal mice were impaled for intracellular recording Dextrorphan DX a clinically tested dextrorotatory morphinan lacking opioid action did not alter neuronal membrane potential or conductance but produced a selective attenuation of NmethylDaspartate NMDA responses kainate and quisqualate responses were not affected DX also antagonized morphological and chemical lactate dehydrogenase efflux evidence of cortical neuronal cell injury produced by toxic bath exposure to NMDA quinolinate or glutamate but did not affect toxic exposure to quisqualate or kainate This selective antagonism of neurotoxicity was apparent at micromolar concentrations of DX with an ED50 of 13 to 17 microM A similar but less potent neuronprotective effect was seen with the opioid levorotatory enantiomer of DX levorphanol ED50 40 microM The Omethyl derivative of DX dextromethorphan also antagonized NMDA and glutamate neurotoxicity but with possibly lower efficacy than DX The higher potency of DX over levorphanol suggests that this novel neuronprotective action is not mediated by classic opiate receptors it may be mediated at the sigma opiatephencyclidine site If further studies establish that DX and related compounds retain neuronprotective efficacy in appropriate animal models the established clinical safety record of DX and dextromethorphan may allow prompt investigation of the NMDA receptorblockade strategy in certain neurological disease states
R986	Classically the stability of the lacrimal film is due to the surfacing of the epithelial surface by the mucus produced by the goblet cells However there are many objections to this hypothesis Deducing from electron microscopy of the epithelial cells which shows vesicles in the superficial layer and glycocalix threads on the microvilli and other clinical facts we think that the surfacing agent is not mucus but glycocalix The disappearance of goblet cells during sicca syndrome is not the cause but the result of the dryness Epithelial cell integrity is essential for the stability of the tear film and therapeutics must aim at regenerating these cells rather than only replacing the lacrimal film by tear substitute
R987	In an epidemiological study of occupational dermatitis in 15 different northern Italian animal feed mills 204 workers were interviewed examined and patch tested to 34 allergens selected from the additives most commonly used in the animal feed mills under consideration The prevalence of occupational contact dermatitis was 137 28204 78 16204 irritant contact dermatitis and 58 12204 allergic contact dermatitis from animal feed additives Among the latter there were sensitizations to our knowledge hitherto unreported in the literature to indigo carmine 2 cases monensin sodium 1 case thiabendazole 1 case methylchlorpindol 1 case and amprolium hydrochloride 1 case 39 8204 of the workers complained only of pruritus sine materia on exposed areas of the body Contact dermatitis increased with respect to duration of employment the difference in the rate of contact dermatitis between workers employed in animal feed mill for greater than 10 years and those employed for less than 10 years was statistically significant p less than 005 68 14204 had latent sensitivity which was more frequent in workers with less than 1 year of employment with respect to more experienced colleagues
R988	Vitamin A and its derivatives retinoids exhibit profound effects on the proliferation and differentiation of many cell types However the molecular mechanism by which retinoids exert these effects is unknown Cultured murine F9 teratocarcinoma stem cells which differentiate into nontumorigenic endoderm cells in response to retinoic acid RA have been used to identify genes regulated by RA A cDNA library synthesized from F9 cells treated with RA for 8 hr has been screened with a cDNA probe enriched for sequences rapidly induced by RA and a gene that exhibits the characteristics of a primary target for RA has been identified This gene early retinoic acid1 Era1 encodes a 22 to 24kilobase polyadenylylated RNA the level of Era1 mRNA rapidly and transiently increases up to 35fold depending on the concentration of exogenous RA The increase in Era1 mRNA is dependent on the continuous presence of exogenous RA The RAassociated increase in Era1 mRNA is seen even in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors but the increase is prevented by inhibitors of RNA synthesis such as actinomycin D This increase in the steadystate level of Era1 mRNA in F9 cells is a very early effect of retinoic acid on gene expression in this differentiation system
R989	Quantitative clinical and computed tomographic CT measures of Graves ophthalmopathy were obtained in 76 patients Significant correlation of several CT parameters of the midorbital axial CT slice with optic nerve involvement was established By means of clinical measures only limitation of ocular motility was found to correlate with the optic neuropathy The results suggested that there were two distinct populations of patients with Graves disease which could be segregated by CT scan and clinical evaluation one which developed optic neuropathy and one which did not Therefore simple measures performed on the midorbital slice of the CT scan are recommended for all patients with Graves ophthalmopathy as an important adjunct to careful evaluation of extraocular muscle function in order to identify patients at risk of developing optic neuropathy
R990	Human Tlymphotropic virus type I HTLVI has been recently found to be associated with slowly progressive myelopathy We have seen 12 patients with HTLVI associated myelopathy HAM three of whom showed retinal vasculitis In addition two patients had ocular symptoms of vitreous opacity Retinal vasculitis in these patients appears to be phlebitis and sheathing of retinal veins in the periphery of the fundus
R991	Serum inhibitory and bactericidal titers were measured in nine healthy volunteers following single iv doses of ciprofloxacin 100 150 and 200 mg The median peak serum bactericidal titer 5 minutes following completion of a 30minute infusion against two highly susceptible strains of Escherichia coli ranged between 164 and 11024 and titers exceeded 18 for six hours for all dose levels The bactericidal titers against two strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and a methicillinresistant strain of Staphylococcus aureus were considerably lower the median peak being 12 at all dose levels Measured inhibitory and bactericidal titers at five minutes and one hour postinfusion were significantly greater than those predicted measured serum ciprofloxacin concentration to minimum inhibitory concentration MIC or minimum bactericidal concentration MBC for only one strain of E coli Intravenous doses of ciprofloxacin 100200 mg produce high and sustained serum bactericidal titers against highly susceptible bacteria considerably lower levels of activity are seen against bacteria having higher MICs and MBCs but still considered susceptible to the drug
R992	Pediatric dentists use their knowledge of psychologic development and current theories of behavior modification to direct children in coping with the anxieties present at any dental visit Only if these psychologic techniques are inadequate will conscious sedation restraints or general anesthesia be used to control childrens behavior during dental treatment This article emphasizes how dentists help children cope with dental treatment
R993	The diagnosis of tickborne relapsing fever was established in 27 pregnant patients by demonstration of Borrelia spirochaetes in a thick blood smear and the borrelia index was estimated to calculate the density of the spirochaetaemia Clinical findings are described and compared with those reported from Rwanda The results suggest that the density of the spirochaetaemia and the gestational age are the main highrisk factors
R994	The use of magnesium sulfate Epsom salt as a cathartic in patients with impaired renal function can lead to severe toxicity due to hypermagnesemia Although toxicity is uncommon in healthy subjects little is known concerning the extent of absorption of magnesium after a cathartic dose of magnesium sulfate The bioavailability of magnesium following a large oral dose of magnesium sulfate in normal volunteers was examined in the present investigation Baseline 24hour urinary excretion rates of magnesium and creatinine were determined over 3 consecutive days in 6 healthy men The oral administration of 139 g 565 mmoles magnesium sulfate USP in 4 equal hourly increments resulted in the urinary excretion corrected for baseline excretion rate of 40  29 mean  SD of the dose of magnesium during the first 24 hours and 69  70 of the dose during a 72hour interval Magnesium sulfate administration had no effect on the 24hour urinary excretion rate of creatinine The baseline excretion rate of magnesium was significantly correlated with that of creatinine r  0875 and inorganic sulfate r  0921 All of the subjects experienced mild or moderate diarrhea Therefore magnesium is absorbed to a limited and variable extent in healthy adults following a cathartic dose of magnesium sulfate
R995	OBJECTIVETo assess the effect of long term antihypertensive treatment on prognosis in diabetic nephropathy DESIGNProspective study of all insulin dependent diabetic patients aged under 50 with onset of diabetes before the age of 31 who developed diabetic nephropathy between 1974 and 1978 at Steno Memorial Hospital SETTINGOutpatient diabetic clinic in tertiary referral centre PATIENTSForty five patients 20 women with a mean age of 30 SD 7 years and a mean duration of diabetes of 18 7 years at onset of persistent proteinuria were followed until death or for at least 10 years INTERVENTIONSAntihypertensive treatment was started a median of three 013 years after onset of nephropathy Four patients 9 received no treatment and 9 20 13 29 and 19 42 were treated with one two or three drugs respectively The median follow up was 12 415 years MAIN OUTCOME MEASURESArterial blood pressure and death RESULTSMean blood pressure at start of antihypertensive treatment was 14895 1550 mm Hg Systolic blood pressure remained almost unchanged slope 001 95 confidence interval 039 to 037 mm Hg a year while diastolic blood pressure decreased significantly 087 065 to 110 mm Hg a year during antihypertensive treatment The cumulative death rate was 18 8 to 32 10 years after onset of nephropathy in contrast to previous reports of 50 to 77 10 years after onset of nephropathy As in previous studies uraemia was the main cause of death 9 patients 64 CONCLUSIONSThe prognosis of diabetic nephropathy has improved during the past decade largely because of effective antihypertensive treatment
R996	The pharmacologic treatment of depression in the elderly is often complicated by cardiovascular disease and other medical illnesses Both the tricyclic antidepressants and the monoamine oxidase MAO inhibitors have adverse effects that are potentially dangerous in this age group Second generation antidepressants may have fewer cardiovascular and anticholinergic side effects but many do not offer any real advantage over the older drugs In practical terms the choice of antidepressants for use in elderly patients will be based largely on their degree of tolerance for unwanted effects
R997	Twentyseven patients with chronic progressive multiple sclerosis were treated with highdose intravenous cyclophosphamide induction on either an impatient or outpatient basis Following induction patients were randomized to alternatemonth outpatient maintenance or no maintenance therapy These groups as well as 24 nonrandomized control patients were compared with each other after 12 18 and 24 months of followup All groups were similar in age sex duration of disease and degree of disability before treatment Fiftynine percent of all cyclophosphamidetreated patients were stable at 12 months compared with 17 of all patients in the nonrandomized control group at 12 months A statistically significant difference persisted at 18 and 24 months A trend favoring maintenance therapy when compared with no maintenance therapy was evident at 12 18 and 24 months but was not statistically significant Inpatient vs outpatient induction therapy failed to influence treatment outcome Toxic side effects of nausea and vomiting presented a serious obstacle to maintenance therapy as administered in this protocol
R998	There is only one previous report of an estrogensecreting adrenal tumor occurring in a woman during reproductive years Our patient presented with mild hirsutism associated with menstrual bleeding every 36 weeks The occurrence of apparently intermenstrual bleeding prompted an evaluation of estrogen levels Markedly elevated plasma estrone levels were found 8602305 pmolL normal 50340 Lesser relative elevations in 11deoxycortisol and androstenedione were noted Computed tomographic scanning of the adrenal glands identified a large tumor which was subsequently resected Estrone levels fell to 120 pmolL and all other abnormalities were corrected Eighteen months after adrenalectomy ovulation occurred regularly and steroid levels were entirely normal Steroid production in a cell suspension made from tissue obtained from the 190g tumor was compared with that occurring in normal human adrenal cells The production of estrone by the tumor cells was 40fold greater than that by normal adrenal cells There was also a mild excess of 11deoxycortisol produced by tumor cells but the tumor cells were less than 50 as efficient as normal cells in producing cortisol dehydroepiandrosterone androstenedione testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate Examination of the steroid profile in plasma occurring in three other patients with adrenal tumors reveals that while elevations in estrone occur frequently this is usually due to the peripheral conversion of very high levels of androstenedione Estrone androstenedione and 11deoxycortisol plasma levels were elevated in all four patients dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate was elevated in only two of four patients After resection of one of these tumors all steroid levels remained normal despite the occurrence of extensive metastases These observations confirm the difficulty of making a diagnosis of estrogen excess in a woman during reproductive years because of the paucity of physical signs The acquisition of aromatase activity was clearly demonstrated by tumor cells from our patient in vitro Elevated plasma concentrations of estrone androstenedione and 11deoxycortisol provide useful markers for adrenal tumors but no one steroid can be relied upon in all tumors and metastases may lack the steroidogenic capabilities of the primary tumor
R999	Since the inception of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy 9 years ago treatment strategies have changed Patients currently are receiving larger numbers of higher voltage shock waves However upper limits of safety for these treatments have not been established In an attempt to address this question a comparative study of effects of extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy on laboratory values between 2 stone centers Munich and Tucson using different treatment strategies 3 to 4 years apart was done to identify possible differing effects Patient stone burdens were similar However Tucson patients received almost twice the number of shock waves Both groups showed a significant decrease in hematocrit by 87 per cent in Munich and 64 per cent in Tucson Both groups had a significant increase in white blood count 145 per cent in Munich and 227 per cent in Tucson In addition both groups had increased serum levels of glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase of 433 and 597 per cent respectively However only the Tucson group showed increases in serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase lactic dehydrogenase and total bilirubin in 515 408 and 46 per cent of the patients respectively Further analysis indicated that extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy was associated with 2 significant shortterm changes of blood or serum laboratory values 1 those presumed to be dilutional from related infusions rather than extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy treatments themselves and 2 those presumed to be related to cellular injury after high energy treatments Elevated serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase lactic dehydrogenase and total bilirubin values of Tucson patients clearly were related to higher kilovolts and number of shocks or to treatments on the right sideABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS
R1000	On the basis of previous indirect measurements skeletal muscle has been implicated as the major site of glucose uptake and it has been suggested that muscle glycogen formation is the dominant pathway However direct measurements of the rates of glycogen synthesis have not been possible by previous techniques We have developed 13C NMR methods to measure directly the rate of human muscle glycogen formation from infused isotopically labeled 113Cglucose We show that under conditions of imposed hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia a majority of the infused glucose was converted to muscle glycogen in a normal man This directly shows that muscle is the major site of glucose disposal under these conditions and provides quantitation of the glucose flux to muscle glycogen
R1001	Monooctanoin a hydrophobic solvent is used clinically to dissolve gallstones via intrabiliary infusion We report a therapeutic misadventure in which an intravenous injection of the drug resulted in respiratory and cardiac arrest and death Autopsy findings included pulmonary lipid embolization detection of monooctanoin in the lung parenchyma and histopathological evidence of multifocal pulmonary hemorrhagic infarcts Respiratory compromise has been observed in the standard treatment of patients In addition deaths in laboratory animals have been attributed to hemorrhagic pneumonitis This case illustrates the potential adverse effects of the inappropriate administration of monooctanoin
R1002	A greater plasma concentration of insulin after isoglycemic enteral than after parenteral administration of glucose is called the incretin effect The primary mediator of this effect gastric inhibitory polypeptide may not account for the complete manifestation of this phenomenon We evaluated other gastroenteric polypeptides with respect to a differential response to oral ingestion of glucose and intravenous administration of glucose at rates that achieved arterial plasma glucose concentrations matched to those from orally administered glucose Gastrin peptide histidine methionine peptide YY and neurotensin showed increases in plasma concentrations in response to oral ingestion of glucose but not to intravenous administration of glucose Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide showed no increased concentration in response to either oral or intravenous administration of glucose The differential responses to orally and intravenously administered glucose noted in the former gastroenteric polypeptides qualifies them as potential mediators of the incretin effect
R1003	A 58yearold alcoholic diabetic man presented with multiple ulcerated skin lesions and polymicrobial septicemia Sporothrix schenckii was recovered from blood cultures and was resistant to amphotericin B by in vitro testing Amphotericin B therapy failed but the patient responded dramatically to itraconazole therapy only to relapse 3 months after therapy was stopped Reinstitution of itraconazole therapy has produced another dramatic response This report is noteworthy for three reasons First to our knowledge it represents only the second reported instance of fungemia with S schenckii that responded to medical therapy Second it illustrates that in vitro antifungal susceptibility tests may predict clinical infection response to drug therapy Third it suggests that itraconazole has significant promise in treating systemic sporotrichosis
R1004	In 38 miscarrying women and 38 pairmatched controls all studied retrospectively the mean pairdifference in MCV is  12 fl P less than 005 onetailed As ethanol elevates MCV this might weakly support the suggested role of ethanol in some miscarriages although folateB12 deficiencies cannot be excluded The paper demonstrates only the feasibility of a first step in defining the possible role of ethanol in some miscarriages It identifies a difficulty encountered from earlier attendance in the miscarrying group so that a later study could circumvent it and perhaps lead to a case for funding of a prospective enquiry into the doseresponse relations of any association that might exist
R1005	We randomized 31 children with a 1st afebrile unprovoked seizure to receive carbamazepine CBZ or no medication for 1 year or until the time of a 2nd seizure All seizures had a focal onset or were generalized tonicclonic Overall 214 randomized to CBZ and 917 with no medication had a recurrent afebrile seizure Compliance with CBZ was excellent in 1214 but noncompliance may have contributed to 1 of the recurrences with CBZ Four discontinued CBZ because of side effects Two additional children taking CBZ had a febrile seizure Thus only 614 taking CBZ had a year completely seizurefree with no unacceptable medication side effects Of those taking no medication 2 had a febrile recurrence and 717 had a year completelyseizure free Side effects and febrile recurrences may limit the value of CBZ for some children although CBZ appears to reduce significantly recurrences after a 1st afebrile seizure
R1006	To assess whether different electrophysiological characteristics could account for the heterogeneous secretion of individual betacells in vitro we used patchclamp configurations to study currents in plaqueforming insulinsecreting and nonplaqueforming rat pancreatic betacells that were distinguished in a reverse hemolytic plaque assay RHPA after a 30min stimulation by 167 mM glucose RHPA showed that the population of single betacells under study was stimulated P less than 0010001 to secrete insulin by 167 mM glucose 100 microM tolbutamide 20 microM glyburide or 30 mM KCl but under these conditions also comprised betacells that did not secrete detectable amounts of insulin Under current clamp conditions secreting and nonsecreting betacells showed analogous resting membrane potentials approximately 60 mV and were similarly depolarized by 30 mm KCl and 100 microM tolbutamide Under voltageclamp conditions total membrane conductance approximately 6 nS was also similar in the glucoseresponsive and unresponsive betacells which when monitored in the wholecell configuration after RHPA showed the following currents a voltagedependent Na current a voltageactivated Ba2 current a voltagedependent K delayedrectifier current a voltagedependent Ca2activated K current and a voltageindependent and tolbutamidesensitive K current In the cellattached configuration and the presence of 28 mM glucose secreting and nonsecreting betacells displayed a similar singlechannel activity that was abolished when glucose concentration was raised to 167 mM We conclude that betacells studied after RHPA have an electrically normal membrane whether they release insulin in response to 167 mM glucose or not
R1007	3H1Desamino8Darginine vasopressin 3H DDAVP was assessed as a radioligand for vasopressin V2receptors by studying its membranebinding characteristics and in vitro autoradiographic localization in rat kidney a rich source of V2receptors 3HDDAVP bound specifically to a single class of high affinity low capacity sites in rat medullopapillary membranes Specific 3HDDAVP binding at 25 C reached equilibrium after 2 h of incubation and was saturable and linear with protein concentration up to 22 mgml protein Saturation analysis gave an equilibrium dissociation constant Kd of 076 nM Displacement of 3HDDAVP binding by unlabeled arginine vasopressin AVP and related analogs gave the following order of potency consistent with that expected for a V2receptor DDAVP approximately equal to AVP approximately equal to 1desaminoAVP greater than lysine vasopressin greater than oxytocin greater than 1betamercaptobeta betacyclopentamethylenepropionic acid 2OmethyltyrosineAVP The Cterminal metabolites of AVP pGlu4Cyt6AVP49 and pGlu4Cyt6AVP48 did not displace 3HDDAVP binding No degradation of 3H DDAVP during incubation could be detected by HPLC analysis In vitro autoradiography of 3HDDAVP binding to rat kidney sections showed a very dense localization of displaceable binding over inner and outer medulla with a much lower density in cortex consistent with the known major localization of V2receptors on renal collecting tubules These studies suggest that 3HDDAVP is a suitable radioligand for labeling V2receptors and may be useful in the characterization of vasopressin receptor subtypes in a variety of tissues and in purification of the V2receptor
R1008	This study elucidates the nature of antigens recognized by monoclonal antibody MoAb HMSA2 which was developed against human melanosomeassociated antigen HMSA of malignant melanoma Maeda and Jimbow Cancer 59415423 1987 Through flow cytometry analyses indirect immunoprecipitation of antigen biosynthetically labeled with 35Smethionine enzymelinked immunosorbent assays and immunoelectron microscopy we found that a the antigens recognized by MoAb HMSA2 were melanosomal matrix glycoproteins b these antigens were expressed mainly in the cytoplasm although they could also be detected on the cell surface c the cytoplasmic expression of MoAb HMSA2 was cellcycle dependent d large amounts of these antigens were released into culture supernatants e MoAb HMSA2 immunoprecipitated two major glycoproteins with molecular weights of 94 and 53 kDa from culture supernatants and f both components have complex Nlinked oligosaccharide chains with sialic acid suggesting that these melanosomal proteins are derived from the transcisternae of the Golgi These human melanosomeassociated antigens may prove useful not only for studying the immunobiology of melanogenesis but also for the immunodiagnosis of melanocytic disorders
R1009	Effects of intracoronary aspirin on coronary blood flow and reactive hyperemia were evaluated in closedchest anesthetized dogs In 18 dogs the left circumflex coronary artery was cannulated and perfused by arterial blood at a constant pressure Coronary blood flow was measured by an electromagnetic flowmeter Intracoronary aspirin at doses of 5 10 and 20 mg reduced coronary blood flow in a dosedependent manner Injection of aspirin at doses of 10 to 25 mg also inhibited reactive hyperemia following the coronary occlusion for fifteen seconds The mean peak flow ratio was reduced from 213  042 to 175  035 p less than 0005 The increment of coronary blood flow provoked by intracoronary arachidonic acid at doses of 150 to 300 micrograms was almost entirely inhibited by the pretreatment of the coronary artery with aspirin The authors conclude that aspirin increases coronary arterial resistance in a dosedependent manner and also restricts the maximal dilating capacity possibly by inhibition of prostacyclin synthesis
R1010	Human ovarian cancer the leading cause of death from gynecologic malignancy tends to remain localized to the peritoneal cavity until late in the disease In established disease ascitic fluid accumulates in the peritoneal cavity We have previously demonstrated that this ascitic fluid is a potent source of in vitro mitogenic activity including at least one unique growth factor We now report that the human ovarian adenocarcinoma line HEY can be induced to grow intraperitoneally in immunodeficient nude mice in the presence 2328 mice but not absence 021 mice of ascitic fluid from ovarian cancer patients Ascitic fluid from patients with benign disease did not have similar effects on intraperitoneal growth of HEY cells 115 mice Once tumors were established by injections of exogenous ascitic fluid they could progress in the absence of additional injections of ascitic fluid The mice eventually developed ascitic fluid which contained potent growth factor activity suggesting that the tumors eventually produced autologous growth factors This nude mouse model provides a system to study the action of ovarian cancer growth factors on tumor growth in vivo and to evaluate preclinically therapeutic approaches designed to counteract the activity of these growth factors
R1011	Increases in the cAMP level are often inhibitory in mature T lymphocytes and may be involved in the development of tolerance to self Ag In this report agents inducing an increase in the cAMP level by independent mechanisms were found to stimulate DNA fragmentation characteristic of a suicide program known as apoptosis in isolated thymocytes Data obtained with cAMP analogs known to act synergistically to stimulate protein kinase A suggested that the latter directly mediated endonuclease activation Agents previously shown to stimulate protein kinase C and to inhibit Ca2dependent TCRmediated thymocyte apoptosis including IL1 also blocked both DNA fragmentation and cell death in response to cAMP suggesting interactions crosstalk between the two protein kinase systems As it has been proposed that apoptosis mediates negative cell selection in the thymus our results indicate that cAMP may play a role in the development of functional mature T lymphocytes
R1012	This paper describes the immunohistochemical staining properties of four monoclonal antibodies MAbs CF EB AD and KB which had been previously shown to be specific for purified neuronspecific enolase NSE by a solidphase radioimmunoassay In this study the authors immunostained a spectrum of normal and neoplastic neuronal neuroendocrine and nonneuronal tissues fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin Positivity was generally restricted to normal neuronal structures and neuronal tumors including adrenal neuroblastoma ganglioneuroblastoma olfactory neuroblastoma pheochromocytoma carotid body paraganglioma duodenal gangliocytic paraganglioma and teratoma with neuroepithelial components Three staining patterns of the normal or neoplastic neuronal structures were observed two MAbs CF and EB stained predominantly the nerve fibers axoplasm one AD stained predominantly the cell bodies perikaryon and one KB stained both the axoplasm and the perikaryon Neuroendocrine tumors such as pulmonary small cell carcinoma pancreatic islet cell tumor thyroid medullary carcinoma and carcinoid tumors from various locations showed a variable staining pattern Tumor cells undergoing mitotic division were usually positive regardless of type Normal structures other than neuronal or neuroendocrine including normal glial cells were negative The authors also studied a range of glial cell tumors with MAbs CF and AD as well as with Dako polyclonal antiserum to NSE The results showed that CF stained the axonal fibers in the normal white matter surrounding these tumors it did not stain the tumor cells or the perikarya of neurons in the surrounding normal gray matter AD stained the glioma cells as well as the perikarya and dendrites of neurons in the surrounding normal gray matter it did not stain the axonal fibers in the surrounding normal white matter By contrast the polyclonal antiserum stained all of these structures The high degree of staining specificity of the MAbs should prove them to be valuable in immunohistochemical diagnosis of tumors as well as in further understanding the role of NSE in neuronal differentiation
R1013	Eighty people all infected by HIVcontaminated drug injection equipment between 1983 and 1984 completed the National Adult Reading Test NART and selected revised Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale WAISR subtests Demographic variables age sex years of education and social class were recorded as additional indices of premorbid functioning Crosssectional comparison of NART and WAISR scores showed that cognitive function was not more impaired with increasing severity of HIV illness as defined by clinical staging Nor were HIVpositive patients more impaired than a control group of seronegative drug users Mean NART scores did not differ significantly from that predicted by a regression model indicating that the NART can be reliably used to estimate premorbid intelligence for this population However current performance on WAISR subtests was below that expected from population models of cognitive function that combine measures of premorbid IQ and demographic factors providing evidence of impaired intellectual function Currently observed cognitive deficits are probably more due to drug use than to the insidious onset of AIDS dementia complex
R1014	Progress in diagnostic ultrasound is driven by the development of new technology The place of new techniques in diagnostic algorithms has to be determined jointly by radiologists and clinicians and appropriate arrangements have to be made for training About 30 million pounds per year is currently spent on diagnostic ultrasound in the UK Diagnostic ultrasound depends on the information obtained as a result of ultrasonic irradiation of the patient Biological effects some of which are undesirable can be produced by ultrasound but there is no evidence that the exposures used in diagnosis carry any risk In judging whether ultrasonic scanning is appropriate in any particular situation it is necessary to consider benefits costs and available resources The costs include not only the costs of the test but also the cost of any hypothetical ultrasonic hazard and the cost of misdiagnosis The most prudent use of ultrasound is that which maximises the benefittotalcost ratio and although this cannot presently be quantified some of the concepts involved can be understood in terms of the health increment and the health decrement the latter apparently being equal to zero when the diagnosis is correctly made using contemporary equipment This approach can be extended to introduce the idea of profit arising from the test As an example obstetric ultrasound is considered to be appropriate when there is a medical indication for it Although routine scanning at 16 weeks of pregnancy has been shown to result in a very large profit there is still conflicting guidance about its advisability on the grounds of safety and existing accounting systems may restrict access to the profit In discussing the desirability of ultrasonic scanning patients can be informed that there is no reason to believe that there are any risks related to ultrasonic exposure The imminent availability of inexpensive ultrasonic scanners for the layman is a worrying prospect to which the medical profession should now try to develop a prudent response
R1015	The authors have studied the sequential events in the process of vertebral metastasis that result in spinal cord compression Different tumor cell lines were injected into the systemic arterial circulation of syngeneic or nude mice and they were killed at timed intervals after injection or when they became paraplegic The following observations were made The tumor cells lodged and grew in the hematopoietic bone marrow of the vertebrae Cancer cells in the vertebral marrow cavity invaded into the spinal canal through the foramina of the vertebral veins rather than destroying the cortical bone Tumor cell lines that grew in an infiltrative fashion migrated toward a posterior location in the spinal canal and compressed the spinal cord from a posterior direction Tumor cell lines that grew as compact tumors formed a tumor mass at the same location from which the cells emerged from the vertebra and compressed the cord predominantly from an anterior direction Radiographic evidence of vertebral metastasis was a late event and commonly associated with significant compression of the cord and extraosseous tumor These experimental findings may help to establish better diagnostic and treatment strategies for patients with metastatic disease of the spine
R1016	This review summarizes our understanding of extraadrenal paragangliomas a subject that has evolved considerably during the past several years Our object was to review the anatomical histologic and biological features of normal and neoplastic glands with emphasis on immunohistologic studies and briefly discuss the potential application of nucleic acid hybridization Since it is difficult to predict clinical outcome for patients with paragangliomas we have emphasized the differences between benign and malignant paragangliomas concentrating on recent results obtained using immunohistologic techniques These studies have emphasized the critical importance of the identification by immunohistologic means of two distinct cell populations chief cells type I and sustentacular cells type II The relationship between these two cell populations stable in normal glands and benign tumors is progressively lost in tumors of increasing degrees of malignancy sustentacular cells being absent from the most progressively metastasizing paragangliomas
R1017	Transvaginal sonographic localization of the placenta was performed in 100 patients suspected of having placenta previa Except in one patient the diagnosis was confirmed at cesarean delivery in all cases of placenta previa found by sonography before delivery resulting in a 933 predictive value of a positive test The predictive value of a negative test was 976 in two patients a lowinsertion placenta diagnosed by sonography was found to be a placenta previa at delivery The sensitivity and specificity of the technique were 875 and 988 respectively Although in some instances transvaginal sonography was performed during vaginal hemorrhage aggravation of bleeding was never observed Transvaginal sonographic localization of the placenta proved to be an accurate and safe diagnostic procedure
R1018	Competition between larval populations of the native North American treehole mosquito Aedes triseriatus and Aedes albopictus recently introduced from Asia to North America was assessed by comparing per capita growth rate estimates for experimental cohorts of larvae developing under a variety of initial density combinations in fluid obtained from tires or from treeholes Estimates of carrying capacities and competition coefficients indicate that competition between the two species will result in stable coexistence in treehole communities but local extinction of A triseriatus in tire habitats
R1019	In type A aortic dissection the intimal disruption is located on or extends to the transverse arch in about 20 of patients Replacement of the arch may then be necessary to avoid leaving an unresected acutely dissected aorta and to prevent bleeding progression of aneurysm rupture and ultimately reoperation or death From 1970 to September 1987 119 patients were operated on for type A acute dissection Starting in January 1977 gelatinresorcinformaldehyde biologic glue was used in 91 patients to reinforce the dissected tissues at the suture sites Among these 119 patients 26 ages 32 to 76 years underwent replacement of the transverse aortic arch in addition to replacement of the ascending aorta In 20 patients cerebral protection was achieved by profound hypothermia 16 degrees to 20 degrees C associated with circulatory arrest 15 to 40 minutes mean 27 minutes during the distal anastomosis In six patients the carotid arteries were selectively perfused with cold blood 6 degrees C during moderate core hypothermia 28 degrees C while cardiopulmonary bypass was discontinued 19 to 34 minutes mean 25 minutes to allow the prosthesis to be sutured without the distal aorta being crossclamped Moderate hypothermia avoided the long rewarming time necessitated by profound hypothermia The hospital mortality rate was 34 926 Two of the 20 patients subjected to profound hypothermia and circulatory arrest died during the operation and seven patients died of postoperative complications No deaths or major complication were observed in the other six patients Followup of the 17 survivors ranges from 3 to 90 months mean 39 One patient died 6 months after the operation of cerebral hemorrhage One patient is disabled by neurologic sequelae Fifteen patients are in good clinical condition New York Heart Association class I or II Postoperative aortograms in 12 patients and computed tomographic scans in all have shown a stable repair of the transverse arch in all survivors but a persisting dissection of the descending aorta in 11 70 Growing experience and improving results in emergency operations for type A aortic dissection have led us to extend the replacement of the aorta to the transverse arch whenever necessary The gelatinresorcinformaldehyde glue has proved to be an efficient adjunct The best cerebral protection was obtained in our experience by carotid perfusion with cold blood during circulatory arrest at moderate core hypothermia
R1020	In a prospective study designed to differentiate pheochromocytoma from other forms of hypertension urinary catecholamines were measured after sleep and clonidine administration in 12 patients with pheochromocytoma 19 hypertensive patients in whom pheochromocytoma was suspected but later excluded and 31 hypertensive patients in whom pheochromocytoma was never suspected The test correctly identified all 12 patients in whom pheochromocytoma was present Four of these had equivocal plasma levels of both norepinephrine and epinephrine suggesting that overnight clonidine suppression may be of particular value when tumor secretion is intermittent or low When pheochromocytoma was not present urinary norepinephrine and epinephrine levels were suppressed below 60 and 20 nmolmmol creatinine respectively after sleep and clonidine the two in combination giving better suppression than sleep alone Since urinary catecholamines can be determined relatively easily by highpressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection this test may be more widely applicable than suppression tests based on plasma measurements
R1021	Inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme renin and the angiotensin II Ang II receptor lower the blood pressure of spontaneously hypertensive rats SHR used as a model of essential hypertension Since their plasma renin levels were normal or subnormal renin in the vascular tissue was considered to play a key role in the maintenance of the hypertension To clarify the source and localization of renin in SHR antirenin antibodies the converting enzyme inhibitors delapril enalapril and the Ang II receptor antagonist DuP 753 were administered to intact and bilaterally nephrectomized SHR and their normotensive controls The efficient hypotensive action of the renin antibody indicated that renin of renal origin is a dominant factor Gradual but complete disappearance of antihypertensive action of these inhibitors of the reninangiotensin system upon bilateral nephrectomy indicated the importance of membraneassociated renin of the renal origin and angiotensin converting enzyme in the maintenance of the spontaneous hypertension
R1022	Volatile substances have been used to alter consciousness since ancient times Societal trends have brought forth one inhalant fad after another It would be reasonable to expect this pattern to change as certain of the inhalants come under greater control or become less available eg leaded gasoline Experimentation with these agents among younger adolescents probably will continue and for this reason pediatric practitioners should be aware of the use of these agents and their potential toxicities
R1023	Using genetic marker data we have developed a general methodology for estimating genetic relationships between a set of individuals The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the practical utility of these methods as applied to the problem of paternity testing Bayesian methods are used to compute the posterior probability distribution of the genetic relationship parameters Use of an intervalestimation approach rather than a hypothesistesting one avoids the problem of the specification of an appropriate null hypothesis in calculating the probability of paternity Monte Carlo methods are used to evaluate the utility of two sets of genetic markers in obtaining suitably precise estimates of genetic relationship as well as the effect of the prior distribution chosen Results indicate that with currently available markers a true father may be reliably distinguished from any other genetic relationship to the child and that with a reasonable number of markers one can often discriminate between an unrelated individual and one with a seconddegree relationship to the child
